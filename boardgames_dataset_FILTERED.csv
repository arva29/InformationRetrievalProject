2,68448,7 WONDERS,2010,ASMODEE,2.3214,5028,"setup depending on the number of players, return to the box all cards not used (see the bottom center of each card). in the age iii deck, remove the 10 guilds (purple cards), randomly and secretly keep only the number of players +2 cards, then shuffle them back into the deck. shuffle the age decks. each deck will have cards equal to 7 x the number of players. shuffle the 7 wonder cards facedown, and deal one to each player. the card and its facing determines the wonders board, and its side, used by each player. alternatively, boards can be chosen if all players agree. each board represents the wonder the player can build and, in the upper left, the resource it produces from the start of the game. each wonder has several stages, each of which has a construction cost and gives a bonus when finished. each player starts with 3 value ‘1’ coins on their board. remaining coins form the bank (make change as required). game overview a game starts with age i, continues with age ii, and ends with age iii. at the beginning of each age, each player is randomly dealt a hand of 7 cards from the appropriate age deck. each age has 6 game turns. during each turn the players simultaneously put into play one card. structures raw materials (brown) produce resources. manufactured goods (gray) produce resources. civilian structures (blue) score victory points.scientific structures (green) score victory points depending on your progress in the 3 scientific fields. commercial structures (yellow) earn coins, produce resource, change commerce rules and may earn victory points. military structures (red) increase your militay might. guilds (purple) score points according to specific criteria. construction the upper left of a card shows its construction cost (if the area is empty the structure is free). if a card has a cost in resources, you must produce the corresponding resources and/or buy them from one of your 2 neighboring cities. starting in age ii, some structures may be built either by paying resources as normal, or for free if the player has built the structure indicated in a previous age. the lower right of a card may show which structures may be built for free in the following age due to this card. production the resources of a city are produced by its wonder board, its brown cards, its gray cards, and some yellow cards. to build a structure, your city must produce the resources indicated on its card. the resources are not spent during construction; they can be used each turn, for the entire game. cards played are never discarded. commerce you may want to build a structure requiring resources you do not produce. if these resources are produced by a neighboring city—players sitting directly to your left or right—you will be able to purchase the missing resource(s). resources you can buy from neighboring cities are : – the resources initially produced by the city (the upper left of the player’s wonder board). – the resources from its brown cards and gray cards. resources produced by some commercial structures (yellow cards) or some wonders are reserved to their owner. for each resource bought, you must give 2 coins to the owner of the resource. selling a resource to a neighboring city does not prevent you from using it, during the same turn, for your own purposes. it is possible, during the same turn, to buy one or more resources from both neighboring cities. the resources bought can only be used on the turn in which they are bought. players can never refuse to sell resources. if both cities neighboring you produce a coveted resource, you are free to purchase from either player. to buy resources, you must have the coins at the beginning of the turn. the coins earned through commerce during a turn cannot be used on that turn, only during the next. free construction (chains) some structures in age ii and age iii have, to the right of their resource cost, the name of a structure of a previous age. if you have built that structure during a previous age, you can build the structure for free (without having to pay the resource cost).1. choose a card each player selects a card from their hand and places it facedown in front of them. a player’s remaining cards are placed facedown between him and the next player. the direction the cards are passed depends on the age :during age i, cards are passed to the left (clockwise). during age ii, cards are passed to the right.during age iii, cards are passed to the left. 2. ac tion all players perform one of the 3 possible actions simultanously with their chosen card. a. build a structure build the structure represented by the card. you may never build 2 identical structures. brown and gray cards are placed beneath one another starting from the upper left corner of the wonders board. other cards are placed faceup in the area in front of your wonder board, to form your city. stack your cards by color, leaving the name of each structure visible. b. build a stage of your wonder to build each stage of your wonder, use a card of your choice as a construction marker (pay the price shown on the wonder board and not the one shown on the structure’s card). then play the card, facedown, half hidden under the wonder board to show that this stage of your wonder is now built. the card then has no other effect, remains hidden, and is not considered a structure. the stages of a wonder must be built in order, from left to right. construction of the wonder is optional. the 3 stages of a wonder are not associated with ages, so multiple wonder stages may be built in a single age, and in any age. each stage can only built once per game. c. discard to gain 3 coins discard the card and take 3 coins from the bank. discarded cards remain facedown and form a discard pile in the center of the table. if a player cannot build the structure or the wonder stage, he must discard the card and take 3 coins.3. mo ve on t o the next hand each player takes the hand of cards passed to him from his neighbor. end of an a ge at the beginning of the sixth and final turn of each age, players receive a 2 card hand from their neighbour. each player then chooses one (as in previous turns) and the second is then discarded, facedown (without getting 3 coins for it). the selected card is played normally, and then the age ends. military conflicts the players then proceed to the resolution of military conflicts. each player compares the total number of shields on their military structures (red cards) with the total of each of the 2 neighboring cities. if a player has a higher total than a neighboring city, that player takes a victory token corresponding to the age just played (age i : +1, age ii : +3, or age iii : +5) if a player has a lower total than that of a neighboring city, that player takes a defeat token (-1 victory point) if a player has an equal total to that of a neighboring city, no token is taken. each player therefore gets 0, 1 or 2 tokens, which are placed on his wonder board. end of the game the game ends at the end of the age iii, after military conflict tokens have been handed out. each player totals their victory points and the player with the highest total is the winner. if there is a tie, the player with the most coins in his treasury is the winner. a tie on coins is not broken further. count victory points in order: 1. military conflicts each player adds their victory and defeat tokens (the total can be negative). 2. treasury contents for every 3 coins in their possession at the end of the game, players score 1 victory point. leftover coins score no points. 3. wonders each player adds the victory points from their wonder. 4. civilian structures each player adds the victory points of their civilian structures (as indicated on each civilian structure). 5. scientific structures the scientific cards earn victory points from sets of identical symbols and from sets of 3 different symbols. the victory points earned by both methods are cumulative.sets of identical symbols: for each of the 3 existing scientific symbols, the player wins a number of points equal to the number of identical symbols squared. there are 4 green cards for each symbol, for a maximum of 16 victory points per family of symbols (this maximum can be increased with the scientific guild and the wonder of babylon). sets of 3 different symbols: for each group of 3 different symbols, each player scores 7 victory points. 6. commercial structures some commercial structures from age iii grant victory points. 7. guilds each guild is worth a number of victory points depending on the configuration of the player’s city and/ or that of the 2 neighboring cities. 2 player expert v ariant setup use the same cards as for 3 players. each player is given a board, and then a third free city board is placed beside them. place the border card between the players. each player is dealt a 7 card hand and the remaining 7 cards make a facedown draw pile to the right of the border card. the player to the left of the free city adds the free city card to his hand. the players and the free city each get 3 coins from the bank. game overview the game proceeds the same way as it would with 3 to 7 players, however players must play, in addition to their own card, a card for the free city. 1. choose a card the player who holds the free city card in his hand takes the first card of the draw pile and adds it to his hand. he then picks 2 cards from his hand, first one for his own city and then one for the free city, while his opponent picks a card for themselves. each player then places their remaining cards on their own side of the border card. the free city cannot discard a card to get 3 coins unless it cannot play a card. the player must then choose, when possible, a card which can be played by the free city (structure construction or wonder building stage). the choice of this card is made after choosing the card to be played for his own city. 2. action the player holding the free city card plays the free city’s card followed by his own while his opponent performs his own action. the free city can buy resources from its 2 neighboring cities according to the normal commerce rules. when a resource is available in both neighboring cities, the player controlling the free city gets to pick which city to buy the resource from (no matter what its cost may be).if the card chosen for the free city can benefit from a free construction (chain), this free construction must be performed. during the sixth turn of the age, there is only one card left in the free city’s draw pile. this last card is discarded at the same time as the seventh and last card of the players. 3. move on to the next hand once all 3 cards are played, the players take the stack of cards on the other side of the border. during the next turn, the other player will play for the free city, and so on until the end of the game. end of an age the player who begins with the free city card changes each age: age i: the card is held by the player to the left of the free city. age ii: the card is held by the player to the right of the free city. age iii: the card is held by the player to the left of the free city. the rules for conflict resolution remain unchanged. end of the game the player who has the most victory points wins the game. in case of a tie, the player with the most coins wins the game."
3,141517,A STUDY IN EMERALD,2013,TREEFROG GAMES,3.4538,238,"setup shuffle the secret identity cards and deal one facedown to each player. this determines whether you are on the side of the loyalists or the restorationists. look at your card but keep it secret from the other players. return the remaining cards to the box without looking at them. place the agent counters faceup by the board. each player chooses a colour and takes the matching main agent counter, deck of 10 initial cards, 6 influence cubes, and 15 control discs. all the remaining influence cubes are placed in a pool near the board. note the one use assassination initial card is discarded after use and functions as a hired assassins card. shuffle the game cards. with 4 or 5 players, place 4 cards facedown in each game box on the board. with 2 or 3 players place 3 cards in each box. return the remaining cards to the box without looking at them. turn the top card in each stack faceup. if an agent is revealed place the corresponding agent counter on the card. place the deck of city cards faceup in the city card box. shuffle the permanent effect cards and place them facedown beside the board. draw the top 2 cards and place them faceup on display. shuffle the double-agent counters facedown. each player draws a number of counters (you may look at yours but keep them secret from the other players): 4-5 players 2 counters each 3 players 3 counters each 2 players 4 counters each place 1 track marker on the 0 space of the war track and the other on the 0 space of the revolution track. each player places one of their control discs on the 0 space of the victory point (vp) track. shuffle the sanity counters and place them facedown near the board. shuffle your initial cards to form your draw deck facedown in front of you, then draw 5 cards to form your starting hand. randomly determine a first player. in player order, players place their main agent counter, human side up, in a city box on the board (more than one may be in the same city).scoring victory points while your identity remains a secret there are only some vps which are recorded immediately. your actual points score is only calculated when your identity is revealed. therefore, the position of your disc on the victory point track is not necessarily an accurate indicator of your total. while your identity is a secret you score vps for the cities you control, the royal ‘persons’ you have assassinated and/or hidden, and for taking the necronomicon card. when your identity is revealed you adjust your vps to give a more accurate total. restorationists and loyalists both score vps for: each controlled city: score vps shown in the city box. necronomicon: score 3 vps. restorationists score vps for: each royal ‘person’ they’ve assassinated: score the vps shown in the royal ‘person’ box. revolution track: score vps shown on the highest vp earning space reached by the marker. controlled agent counters: some agents are worth vps as indicated on the agent counter. you do not score these points if the agent in question is a vampire. the black hand: if you have this card, score an extra 2 vps for every royal ‘person’ you have assassinated. loyalists score vps for: each royal ‘person’ they’ve hidden: score the vps shown in the royal ‘person’ box. war track: score vps shown on the highest vp earning space reached by the marker. vampires: if you have the vampire card score 1 vp per vampire agent, including your main agent, that you control on the board. zombies: if you have the zombie card and all 8 zombie pieces are in play then you score 8 vps. yog-sothoth: if you have this card score 2 vps for each agent you have sacrificed to this god. a loyalist player scores when the game ends for: each restorationist agent they’ve assassinated: score 1 vp for each agent, including a main agent, they’ve assassinated that was controlled by a restorationist player.sanity counters when you draw a sanity counter, reveal it. if it says sane, remove it from the game. if it says mad, keep it. if you have 3 mad sanity counters then you must reveal your secret identity. if you are a restorationist the game ends immediately. if you are a loyalist the game continues with your main agent counter remaining where it is. if there are no more sanity counters left and you are required to draw one, presume that you have gained enough mad counters to reveal yourself. if you are a loyalist and your secret identity has been revealed, you only draw sanity counters to determine whether an agent of yours dies while carrying out an assassination of a royal ‘person’. in all other cases you do not draw any counters. ending the game the game ends when one of these conditions is met: • the marker reaches the top space on the war track or the revolution track • a player reaches a number of vps as indicated on the vp track for the number of players. the game still ends even if his adjusted score ends up below this threshold. • a restorationist player’s main agent is killed, which may be the result of an assassination, destruction by a shoggoth, or drawing a third mad sanity counter. • a player plays the zombie card as their first action and all 8 zombie pieces are on the board. all of the players now reveal their identities, if they have not already done so, and adjust their vp scores. if all players are on the same side, the player with the most vps wins. if there are players on both sides, the side whose player has the lowest individual vp total is eliminated. on a tie, loyalists are eliminated. then the player with the highest score on the remaining side wins. if there is a tie between players on the same side, the player with the most control discs on the board wins. on a tie the tied players share the win. having your main agent die does not stop you from being able to win the game.start with the first player and go clockwise. on your turn perform 2 actions, then draw back up to 5 cards. place played cards faceup in your discard pile; if your draw deck is empty shuffle your discards to form a new deck. if you must lose a card from your hand, draw a replacement immediately. when a card is played, it can only be played one way (use one type of symbol on it, or its action). action: place influence cubes play 1 or more cards, each of which with least 1 cube symbol. take influence cubes from your available stock equal to the number of cube symbols on the cards. these cubes can either be placed on a faceup game or permanent effect card, or in a city box. all the influence cubes placed in a single action must be placed in the same place. you cannot deliberately overpay cards. the only time you can play fewer cubes than the number indicated is when you play a card with 2 cubes on it and you only have 1 available. action: claim 1 card you can only claim a card with your first action and if you haven’t performed a free action yet that turn. you can claim a card if no other player has more points of influence assigned to it than you do, and at least 1 of your points of influence must be an influence cube. on a tie, the tied player with the most agents in the city wins. each influence cube is worth 1 point of influence. each agent you have in the same city (including your main agent) is worth 1 point of influence. influence points from agents count towards claiming both game cards and city cards. when you claim a game card, place it on your discard pile. if the card is marked agent, move the matching agent counter from the card to the city box and place one of your control discs on the counter to show you control the agent. after taking the card, turn the next card in the stack faceup. if it is marked agent, place the matching agent counter on it. when the final card is taken from a game card box, move the war marker 2 spaces up the war track and draw 1 permanent effect card and place it faceup on display. when you claim a permanent effect card, place it faceup in front of you. you do not draw a new permanent effect card to replace the one just claimed. if you take any card marked with the sanity symbol, you must draw 1 sanity counter.when you claim a city card, take the card from the city card deck or ask the player controlling the city to give it to you. if that player had the city card in his hand he draws a replacement card from his draw deck. if he had to retrieve the card from his draw deck he shuffles his deck. place a control disc in the space indicated for the city and increase your vp score by the number of vps the city is worth (shown on the board). if the city was previously controlled by another player, they retrieve their control disc and reduce their vps by the same amount. all of your influence cubes used to claim a card are now placed in limbo. any other influence cubes involved are returned to the available stocks of their owning players. action: retrieve influence cubes play 1 or more cards, each of which with at least 1 cube symbol. retrieve influence cubes equal to the number of cube symbols on the cards and place them in your available stock. cubes may be retrieved from any combination of limbo, city boxes, game cards and permanent effect cards. you cannot obtain cubes from the influence cube pool in this manner. you cannot deliberately overpay cards. the number of cubes you retrieve must match the number of cubes on the cards (unless you played a single card with 2 cubes on it and you only have 1 cube to retrieve). action: buy influence cubes play 1 or more cards, each of which with at least 1 gold symbol. for every 2 gold symbols take 1 of your influence cubes from the pool and add it to your available stock. you cannot deliberately overpay cards. you must spend gold in multiples of 2. if you do not have any cubes in the pool you cannot perform this action. action: move agents move 1 or more agent counters under your control (including your main agent counter). the cost of moving 1 agent along 1 connection is shown in the silver circle on the connection. within an action, each agent may travel as many connections as you can afford, but must use the cheapest route. if a connection has a junction, an agent may use any path stemming from that junction (other than the path they just travelled) for the stated cost. then determine the total cost and play cards from your hand so the number of gold symbols matches the cost. you cannot overpay cards unless the cost is 1 and you have played a single card with 2 gold symbols on it. any number of agents can be in a city box. action: move markers play 1 or more cards, each of which must have at least 1 arrow symbol (choose 1 arrow if there is more than 1). if you choose a pink arrow, move the revolution track marker a number of spaces equal to the number inside the arrow and in the direction indicated. if you choose a green arrow, do the same on the war track. you can use multiple cards to move 1 or both markers. a marker can never move below 0 and you cannot play a card if you cannot move the marker at least 1 space. all restorationists earn vps from the revolution track, and all loyalists earn vps from the war track. players do not immediately claim these vps as to do so would reveal their identity; they only do so when they reveal their identity. action: discard cards select 1 or more cards from your hand and place them on your discard pile. if you discard more than 1 card you may place them in such a way that only 1 card is visible. you still do not draw cards until the end of your turn. action: reveal your secret identity reveal your identity but only if by doing so you cause the game to end, i.e. the number of victory points that are dependent on your secret identity, such as those gained from the revolution and war tracks, are enough to move your victory point marker to or past the necessary space on the victory point track to trigger the end of the game. action: reveal double-agent reveal 1 of your double-agent counters and take control of the agent named on it. you can only take control of an agent that is already controlled by another player. that player removes his control disc and hands the card that goes with the agent to you. place the card on your discard pile and place a control disc on the agent. you cannot reveal an assassinated agent as a double-agent. if a player reveals sherlock holmes as a double-agent, the controlling player may reveal his secret identity. if he is a restorationist he retains control of holmes. if a player reveals professor moriarty as a double-agent, the controlling player may reveal his secret identity. if he is a loyalist he retains control of the professor. action: card action play 1 card and perform the action described on it. if the card is marked free action this does not count towards your 2 action limit. it still counts as an action for the purposes of claiming a card. if the card is marked one use action then after performing the action remove the card from the game. if a card gives you the choice to assassinate royalty or an agent, you cannot do both within an action. action: passgame play"
4,253499,A WAR OF WHISPERS,2020,STARLING GAMES,2.5488,82,"setup each player chooses a matching player board, a set of agents, and a set of loyalty tokens. place the ‘1’ turn marker beside the start space on the board and the other turn markers near the turn tracker. the 5 empires are each represented by a color and animal: bear (blue), lion (yellow), horse (brown), elephant (green), and eagle (red). for each empire, place all banners (cubes) of that color beside the board in a pile near their associated councils to create the banner reserve piles. place a matching color banner on any region on the map that contains a small banner image. sort the empire cards into 5 empire decks and place each beside the corresponding empires. choose a first player and give them the first player marker. players place their initial loyalty bets: shuffle your 5 loyalty tokens and randomly place them facedown on the 5 loyalty slots on your player board. you may then peek at them, and may do so at any time during the game. gameplay 1. deploy agents phase each empire council consists of 4 council positions (sheriff, steward, marshal, and chancellor) on which you can place agents. starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, remove 1 of your agents currently on the board (if any) and then take turns placing 1 agent on any open council position on the board until each player has placed 2 agents. 2 players: each player places 3 agents instead of 2. 2. empire turns phase this phase begins with the bear empire’s turn and proceeds clockwise around the board. during an empire’s turn, each council position in that empire’s council takes 1 available action determined by the player who controls it, starting with the sheriff and following the arrows up to the chancellor. you must take an action with an agent even if that action results in nothing happening. the player who controls a council position is determined as follows:• if a council position contains one of your agents, you control that council position. • if a council position contains no agents, the player who owns the next agent to its right within this council controls that council position. if there are no agents to its right, no player controls it and it will choose to do nothing as its action. council positions each council position has one or more available actions. add banner actions add 2 banners to any region(s) controlled by this empire. for each icon present across all regions controlled by this empire, add 1 banner to any region(s) controlled by this empire. for each icon present across all regions controlled by this empire, add 1 banner to any region(s) controlled by this empire. for each icon present across all regions controlled by this empire, add 2 banners to any region(s) controlled by this empire.attack action attack an enemy army region adjacent to a region controlled by the active empire. only 1 region may be attacked using this action. choose a region controlled by another empire. move any number of banners from an adjacent region controlled by the active empire into the chosen region. you cannot attack across oceans or seas. if any banners are being moved from a conquered region, you must leave at least 1 banner behind. you can never completely abandon a conquered enemy region using an attack. you may never use the attack action to simply shift banners among an empire’s controlled regions; it must be used to attack into an enemy- controlled region. combat occurs when banners from one empire move into a region controlled by another empire. losses are then taken: each side discards banners at a 1:1 ratio until one (or both) side is depleted. if either side has any banners remaining, they have won the battle. regions with forts destroy 1 attacking banner when an attacking army enters this region. draw empire card actions draw 1 card from this empire’s deck and add it to your hand. for every 2 icons present across all regions controlled by this empire, draw 1 card from this empire’s deck and add it to your hand. for every 3 icons present across all regions controlled by this empire, draw 1 card from this empire’s deck and add it to your hand. for every 2 icons present across all regions controlled by this empire, draw 1 card from this empire’s deck and add it to your hand. for every 3 icons present across all regions controlled by this empire, draw 1 card from this empire’s deck and add it to your hand. swap agent action swap this agent with any other agent within this council, then immediately take its action. this does not reset the turn. checking supply a region may only contain 4 banners at the end of an empire’s turn. if at the end of the turn there are more than 4 banners, return banners to the supply until there are only 4 left. if a region contains a farm, it has a higher limit of 6 banners. mark the turn place the current turn marker on the next available space on the turn tracker. the first player marker now passes the first player token to the next player clockwise. if the last turn marker is placed, the game ends without performing the swap and cleanup phases: proceed to final scoring. 3. swap phase starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, you each have the opportunity to swap any 2 of your unrevealed loyalty tokens. to swap 2 loyalty tokens, switch the loyalty slot in which the 2 tokens are currently positioned in and flip them faceup so the empire symbols are now visible. these are now revealed and cannot be swapped in subsequent turns. 4. cleanup phase each player must discard any empire cards in excess of the maximum hand size of 5.regions a region is controlled by an empire if it has at least 1 banner there, or if it is one of their home regions and contains no enemy banners. to control a city, an empire must control the region the city is in. a home region is a region whose color matches the empire’s color. an empty region is any region that does not contain a banner. however, all regions (and any cities they contain) are always controlled by one of the empires. if there are no banners then the original owner (indicated by the colour of the region and its border) is the controlling empire. a friendly army/banner is one of the same empire that currently controls a region (not necessarily the active empire). if the region is empty of banners, a friendly banner is one that matches the original controller of the region at setup (indicated by the colour of the region and its border). empire cards the empire cards you acquire can be played from your hand to affect the game in a variety of different ways. each empire’s cards have their own symbol at the top of the card. you may add as many cards to your hand as you like, but during the cleanup phase, you must discard down to no more than 5 cards in your hand. to play a card, choose one, then choose one of the abilities listed on it. then, pay its cost by discarding a number of cards of the empire equal to the cost listed beside the chosen ability. the card being played counts as one of the cards being discarded to pay the cost. therefore, the first ability on each card can be played without discarding any additional cards. you can play a card immediately before, during, or immediately after using one of your own agents, and the agent doesn’t have to match the empire of the card(s) being played. you can play multiple cards in a single turn. any time a card is played or discarded, shuffle it back into the empire deck it belongs to. advanced rule: assigning agents to regions when assigning agents during the deploy agents phase, instead of assigning an agent to a council position, you may choose to assign it to any region on the map, even if occupied. a player’s agent in a region counts as a city for that player in final scoring. players can have a maximum of 2 agents deployed to the map. regions can contain more than 1 agent, but not from the same player. agents played to a region can be retrieved at the start of the deploy agents phase, just like any other agent. agents cannot be added or removed from the map in any other way. final scoring the game ends after the reveal loyalty phase of the 4th round. all loyalty tokens are scored and the player who scores the most points is the winner. you have 5 loyalty tokens, one for each empire, and 5 loyalty slots on your player board: devout (x4), dutiful (x3), affiliated (x2), unallied (x0), and opposed (x-1). score loyalty tokens by multiplying the number of cities the corresponding empire controls at the end of the game by how loyal you were to that empire. if 2 players are tied for equal points then the player that swapped loyalty the least during the game wins. if both players are still tied, the player with the most empire cards in hand wins. loyalty tokens score you points based on the loyalty level they are bet on and the number of cities the corresponding empire

plus 4 scientist meeples, 3 assistant meeples, and a player score marker all matching the laboratory board color. set the attribute dials on your laboratory to 0 for humanity , and to 1 for reputation and expertise . place 1 scientist and 2 assistants on the slots on your character card. set your score marker on the 0 space of the score track on the paris board. choose a first player to take the first player creature meeple. when cards are played or discarded, they go to the bottom of their deck. if you run out of materials or fr, use substitutes. round order 1. event phase the first player draws the top card of the event deck and finds the side that corresponds with the current round. if the card is an event card, read it aloud and put it into play. place event markers at affected locations as a reminder. if the card is an encounter card with a trigger of ‘now’, read it aloud to the indicated target player. if the card is an encounter with a location trigger, hold onto the card, keeping its location trigger secret. when any player other than the card holder places a meeple at that location, announce there is an encounter and read the appropriate entry before they pay any costs or resolve any effects. location encounters are held for the duration of the game, and discarded only after being triggered. if the card holder forgets to announce the encounter card during the trigger, the card must be discarded without being resolved. when the first player chooses an encounter target, they can choose any player, including themselves. if more than 1 player meets the target condition, the first player chooses the target from amongst them. when the target is the first player, choose any other player to read the card. when an event or encounter card directs you to go to an entry, refer to the numbered entries in the rulebook. there are 2 additional event effects: execution: draw 1 or 2 cards from the public square deck and place them faceup on the slots at the public square (2 players: 1 card, 3-4 players: 2 cards). lightning storm: all players charge their leyden jars (flip to charged side). if you purchase a leyden jar this round, immediately charge it. 2. city phase starting with the first player and going clockwise, players take turns placing meeples until all players have placed all of their meeples or are forced to pass. on your turn you must remove 1 meeple from your character card and place it on a location space on the paris board or on your laboratory board, then resolve that space’s effect. if you have no meeples left on your character card on your turn, or if there are no valid spaces to play, you must pass. only a scientist meeple can be placed on this space. pay this many fr (return them to the supply) to place a meeple on this space. if another meeple is on a space, you must bump that meeple before placing your own meeple there. move the bumped meeple to the first available space of the bump track and give fr equal to the cost of that space to the owner of the bumped meeple. if the bump track is already full, the meeple cannot be bumped and you cannot place your meeple on the occupied space. you can bump your own meeples for 0 fr, but only if there is space on the bump track. 3. lab phase during the lab phase each player simultaneously resolves the following actions, in order: 1. build a monster part (as many times as you like or are able) choose a part to build by consulting your anatomy card (you can create at most 1 head, 1 torso, 2 arms and 2 legs). to build a muscle monster part consult the start a monster part side. if you already have muscle parts built and wish to add skin to one of them, consult the complete a monster part side. then do the following in order: 1. check your expertise level meets or exceeds that part’s expertise requirement. 2. discard the materials indicated by the part’s material requirement. note the decomposition stage of the most decayed material you are discarding. animal (orange) material can be substituted for almost any other kind of material, but reduces your vps. stage iii or iv animal material cannot be substituted for blood. 3. add a corresponding part token to your operating table (or, if adding skin to a previously built muscle part, flip it over to the skin-side on your operating table, retaining any damage on it). 4. gain 1 expertise .5. gain the number of victory points (vps) corresponding to the stage of decomposition of the used material that is most decayed, less 1 or 2 points (max) if any animal material was used (as indicated on the anatomy card). if you build a monster part and that part is later downgraded (flipped or discarded), you do not lose the expertise and vps you gained; and you can gain them again for rebuilding that part. 2. throw the switch (up to 1 time) if you have at least 1 completed monster part (skin-side up) on your operating table, you may throw the switch once: 1. flip 1-3 of your charged leyden jars to their uncharged side. 2. roll 2 gray shock dice for each leyden jar you just flipped. if you have research cards to play for their dice mitigation effect, you may use them now. 3. resolve all results by placing that many markers, 1 at a time, onto 1 or more parts on your operating table. if 2 markers are ever on a monster part, immediately discard those markers and downgrade the monster part 1 step: if it is a muscle part, discard it; if it is a non-alive skin/complete part, flip it to its muscle side; if it is an alive part, discard its marker. when placing damage, you cannot place a second damage on a part unless all parts already have 1 damage. 4. receive 1 (max) when you roll 1 or more . 5. if able, place an marker on a skin-side up monster part on your operating table for each result (it is now alive). a monster part cannot have more than 1 marker on it. 3. preserve materials (as many times as you like or are able) move any number of organs (purple) and muscle (brown) materials from spaces on your decomposition track to your preservation space. you cannot have more than 9 materials on your preservation space at a time. 4. reset phase do the following in order: 1. decompose: each player without an ice block in their lab discards all materials on stage iv of their decomposition track and all blood material on stage ii, then moves each remaining material in stage i through iii one space to the right on their track. players with an ice block do not decompose materials but each solid ice block is flipped to the half-melted side and each half-melted ice block is returned to the supply. 2. refresh the board: discard and then replenish all cards at the hospital, docks, academy, and saint-roch. the hospital is always replenished with a number of faceup cards in a stack equal to the number of players. discard all cards at the public square; do not replenish them. discard any event card in play, plus any corresponding event markers. 3. refresh meeples: return placed meeples to your character card. 4. advance the captain: advance the captain meeple 1 space along the story track. if he reaches the last space (skull), the game ends immediately. gaining materials materials gained (except bone) are in one of 4 stages of decomposition (stage i the freshest and iv the most decayed). you cannot have more than 15 materials on each space of your decomposition track at a time. if a space has more than 15 materials, immediately discard the excess. whenever you gain materials, take the number and type of materials from their supplies and place them on the appropriate space on your decomposition track or bone space.bone (white) materials never decompose and are always added to the bone space, not the decomposition track. you cannot have more than 12 materials on your bones space. they can later be sold at the market if not used. humanity & research cards you may have up to 3 of each type of card; if you want to draw a 4th humanity or research card (this is always optional), you must first discard 1. playing a card is always optional. they offer a one- time effect, and many grant an attribute or fr benefit listed as icons, after which the card is discarded to the bottom of its deck. alternatively, research cards can be played after rolling shock dice to gain the dice mitigation effect listed after the die icon. additional cards can be played for additional re-rolls. attributes when increasing an attribute, turn that attribute dial that many spaces clockwise; when decreasing, turn it counterclockwise. signifies an increase in humanity and signifies a loss. some effects cause you to lose an attribute as a cost. if you cannot lose an attribute, you may still gain the benefit. if you reach -10 humanity (), you can no longer gain or lose humanity when taking actions that normally cause you to do so. when moving a dial causes it to move onto or past one or more spaces with any of the following icons, resolve the icon effects. if you move past a space who’s effect you previously resolved, but this time heading in the opposite direction, undo the effect. end of the game the game ends when the captain meeple reaches the last space of the story track or when one or more players has brought their monster to life (all 6 body parts alive) at the end of a lab phase. at the end of the game each player gains additional vps: • alive points for each monster part with an marker. • 10 points for each bonus objective you have achieved. • points equal to the highest vp value reached on your reputation and expertise dials. • points (gain or loss) equal to the highest or lowest vp value reached on your humanity dial. • if the game ends with the captain reaching the last space on the story track, the player with the highest positive humanity gains 5 additional vps. if 2 or more players are tied, each of them gains 5 vps. the player with the most vps wins. on a tie, tie breakers are: 1. the player with the most alive monster parts. 2. the player with the most fr. 3. turn order position relative to the first player: 1 (first player), 2 (left of first player), etc. optionally, if the game ended by a player bringing their monster to life, read the it’s alive section in the rulebook. if the game ended by the captain meeple reaching the last space of the story track, read the captain walton triumphs section. bonus objectives bonus objectives are additional vps you can earn by meeting the conditions on the bonus objective markers in play. once you meet the condition, take the marker and place it in your play area. you will gain these points at the end of the game. once claimed, no other player may obtain that objective. if 2 or more players meet the condition for the same bonus objective during the lab phase (in which actions are simultaneous), the tie breaker is decided by each player’s turn order relative to the first player."

direct you to a story paragraph that informs you how to proceed. if you are not directed to a specific paragraph, see campaign loss in your current storybook. game turn each day in the game is a campaign round made up of a series of steps. each step incorporates one or more phases: voyage phase, adventure phase or battle phase. if you’re not in the adventure phase or the battle phase, you’re in the voyage phase. steps 1. movement (always): move the argo onto a different tile. 2. timeline (always): advance the timeline. 3. exploration (always): trigger exploration symbols, then resolve an exploration draw. move the adversary if required, then perform an acclimation if applicable. 4. expedition (conditional): if on a tile with an adventure or r&r symbol, consult the adventure table and resolve an adventure. remember to gain mnemos nodes and mark a fated box. 5. encounter (conditional): if there are any timeline battles or battle events on the timeline, resolve them. 6. advancement (optional): craft gear, resolve advancement events, develop new technologies and use existing ones. 7. story (conditional): if there are any story events on the timeline, someone has an unresolved mnemos breakthrough, or the story progression has been triggered, resolve them. 8. doom (conditional): if there are any doom events on the timeline or the doom progression has been triggered, resolve them. 9. end (always): if you are on an unexplored tile, it becomes explored. after the end step, proceed to the next campaign round. continue resolving campaign rounds until the cycle ends with your victory or defeat. voyage phase 1. movement step you must move the argo to an adjacent map tile. directional arrows on your tile represent waterways you can travel through. if the tile you’re moving to isn’t already on the table, find the tile with the corresponding number on its back (next to the arrow) and place it adjacent to the tile you are traveling from, so that the directional arrows on the shared border of the tiles align. orient the new tile in the same way as all of the other tiles. the argo can only travel on water. a tile may be divided into sectors, marked with and symbols. if your current tile has 2 arrows pointing in the same cardinal direction, it means that the adjacent tile will be sectored. you must choose which one of those arrows to follow before you reveal the new tile. once you place the new tile, aligning the arrows, you’ll end up on either the and sector. you can leave a sector only by following the directional arrows marked with that sector’s symbol. the sector you are currently on does not influence your access to map symbols. faction symbols tell you about the local faction you can encounter on a map tile your current tile connects to. exploration symbols during the exploration step, you will gain +1 . during the exploration step, if the tile is unexplored, you will gain +1 . during the exploration step, if the tile is unexplored, you will gain +1 titan (dreamwalker). adventure symbols hub adventure. during the expedition step, if the tile is unexplored, you will resolve an adventure from one of your cycle’s adventure hubs. r&r adventure. during the expedition step, if the tile is unexplored, you will resolve an adventure from the r&r section. other restricted. you require an additional technology to move through this waterway. cities and large settlements. after you move from a tile with this symbol, mark the tile with the last visited city token. you cannot use negotiation technology abilities on a tile with this token. you only mark the last settlement you visited; when you leave another tile with this symbol, move the token from its previous location. 2. timeline step mark the next empty box on the timeline on your argo sheet. it designates the current day of your odyssey. if there are no empty boxes to mark, your time has run out and your campaign is lost. if there are any symbols, events or other notes assigned to the current day, they must be resolved in the appropriate step: acclimations: acclimations upgrade your exploration deck with new cards and are resolved in the exploration step. battles : timeline battles and additional battles noted on the timeline are resolved in the encounter step. technology breakthroughs: structural technology and battle technology breakthroughs are resolved in the advancement step. advancements: all events added to the timeline by using argo facilities are resolved in the advancement step. story events: any event leading directly to a story paragraph in the storybook as well as any other events that are not breakthroughs, advancements, acclimations or battles are story events and are resolved in the story step. 3. exploration step 1. resolving exploration symbols positive exploration symbols, like progress and titan , are active only on unexplored tiles and are only resolved once per tile per cycle. if you revisit an explored tile, you do not gain the associated bonuses again. negative exploration symbols, like doom , are active both on explored and unexplored tiles. if you revisit an explored tile, you always gain the associated penalty. 2. resolving an exploration draw draw cards from the exploration deck and resolve them one by one until you draw a card that shows the stack end symbol . then repeat the process, creating a second stack of cards. exploration cards are always resolved in this order: 1. resolve the main effect of the card, from top to bottom. 2. if there is an adversary symbol on the card, resolve the adversary activation. 3. if there is a special disposal effect, resolve it: • if a card is removed until the next timeline battle, set it aside. it is shuffled back into the exploration deck after you resolve a timeline battle. • if a card is removed permanently, return it to the box. all other exploration cards are left on the table until the end of the exploration draw, then they are shuffled into the deck. 4. if there is a stack end symbol on the card, end the stack. if there is a draw another symbol there, draw another exploration card for that stack. after you end the first stack, draw the second stack. when you end the second stack, shuffle all drawn exploration cards that have not been removed from the deck back into the deck. 3. moving the adversary adversaries are special primordials that actively hunt the argo on the map. ignore all adversary activations until an event instructs you to introduce it. when an adversary is introduced into a campaign, write its name on the adversary track. once the adversary has been introduced, whenever you encounter an adversary activation on an exploration card: • if the adversary is already on the map, move it 1 tile towards the argo along the shortest available path. then, if the adversary is on the same map tile as the argo, remove its miniature from the map and trigger an adversary battle (go to the corresponding battle scenario in the storybook; you may need to refer to other cycles). you must resolve the adversary battle at the end of your current step. • if the adversary is not on the map, but this is the first symbol encountered during this exploration step, nothing happens. • if the adversary is not on the map, and you’ve encountered 2 symbols during this exploration step, spawn the adversary. place the small miniature of the current adversary 4 tiles away from the argo. if you cannot, place it as far away as possible. if you spawned the adversary during the exploration step, immediately end this adversary activation and ignore any other adversary activations until the end of this step. whenever you encounter an adversary symbol on an any other game element, you must perform an adversary activation as normal – but in this case it only takes 1 adversary symbol to spawn the adversary. the adversary moves 1 tile per symbol and can only move vertically or horizontally through revealed tiles. it can move onto any adjacent map tile, even if it is not connected by a directional arrow, and ignores tile sectors and all map symbols. if there is more than one equally viable path, the adversary prioritizes the horizontal one as long as it brings it closer to the argo. if there is more than one way for the adversary to move, it will always move horizontally. if the adversary is already on the same tile as the argo during an activation, it does not move, but you still trigger the adversary battle. if an adversary activation happens during a battle, you must resolve it as soon as the current battle ends. 4. performing acclimations each campaign has a fixed number of acclimations, marked on your timeline. whenever your current day calls for an acclimation, resolve all other actions during the exploration step, except an adversary battle, then perform the acclimation. search the exploration deck for the cards with numbers corresponding to the list found on the left of the acclimation arrow and permanently remove them from the game. then, find the exploration cards with numbers listed on the right of the arrow and shuffle them into the exploration deck.4. expedition step if the argo is on an unexplored tile with an adventure or r&r symbol, resolve an adventure phase. all newly revealed tiles are unexplored. if you move back onto an explored tile, you do not resolve the and symbols. 5. encounter step resolve battles noted on the timeline. if more than one happens on the same day, choose the order in which they are resolved. timeline battles: choose which of the 2 regular primordials (shown on the evolution track on the argo sheet) from your current cycle you want to face, then proceed to the corresponding setup in the storybook. adversary battles: find the corresponding setup in the storybook. additional battles will point you to a specific page of the storybook with the battle setup. 6. advancement step research new technologies, trade, craft gear, create new titans and make use of argo facilities. there are also unique advancement events you will gain access to during the campaign. all events added to the timeline using technologies are advancement events and are resolved in this step. research add technologies you research to the technology deck. you then gain access to all abilities provided by technologies in the deck. add technologies available for research to the projects deck. this gives you no benefits, but you can look at them to see what you can gain by researching them. when you research a technology card, immediately add all the technology cards it leads to to the projects deck (some cards have more than 1 requirement). technologies that are not in either deck are in the reserves and are kept in the box. they may be added to the projects deck when you research another technology or as a result of some event. technologies are divided into 3 types: core technologies are non-researchable and are gained automatically, usually at the start of the cycle. the cards are large and some have cycle-specific versions. structural technologies include utility facilities that allow you to mitigate the hardships of the voyage, manage resources, breed new titans, scout the region, and more. battle technologies include production facilities, giving you access to new gear cards and argo abilities. new technology cards can only be researched on specific timeline days called technology breakthroughs, marked by the and . if there is of these symbols on your current day on the timeline, you may research 1 technology of that type from the projects deck. to research a new technology card, fulfill all of its requirements. once you choose a technology you want to research, search the reserves for all technology cards it leads to and add them to the projects deck. then add the researched card to the technology deck. from now on, you gain access to all the benefits and abilities provided by this technology. if you gain a technology card from a source other than a technology breakthrough, add it to your technology deck (also adding any technology cards it leads to to your projects deck). when you use a technology ability with cooldown x, write its name as an event on the timeline, x days from today, with the word cooldown in parentheses. cooldown events have no effect when resolved but you can only use the ability again after you resolve its cooldown event. cooldown events are advancement events. structural technologies structural technologies are primarily used outside of battle. if an active ability of a structural technology does not specify when it can be used, it can be used during the advancement step. each active technology ability can be used once per day (once per campaign round), with the exception of save abilities. • permanent abilities introduce constant effects and rule changes, and are always active. • reference abilities include rule summaries and serve as a reminder; they do not introduce any additional effects. • immediate effects must be resolved the moment their respective technologies are researched. • negotiation abilities may be used while on a map tile with a symbol (except tiles with the last visited city token). • save abilities may be used whenever you need them. they can only be used once per ability per game effect. • all other technology abilities may be used in the advancement step, unless their effect denotes a specific timing condition. battle technologies production facilities: these give you access to new gear cards and are only used for crafting. argo abilities : when you perform battle setup during the battle phase, you decide which of these you will prepare for that battle. the number of argo abilities you may simultaneously prepare during a battle depends on your current propylon technology. trading game elements that allow you to trade resources have a limited number of resource exchanges you can perform. one exchange is a trade of 1 resource type for another resource type, according to the ratio noted on the card. as a single exchange you can trade as many units of a resource type as you like. crafting gear you can craft multiple gear cards during every advancement step if you have the required resources, but only gear listed on the production facilities in your technology deck, and you cannot craft more copies of a single gear card than there are copies of that card available. resources are mortal, primordial, divine, and rare. to craft a card, choose an available card you want to craft, spend resources equal to the cost on the corresponding technology card (removing those resources from your argo sheet). if another card is specified as part of the cost, it is also spent and returned to the box. add the crafted card to the argo armory; from now on it can be equipped on titans and used in battle. titan breeding each breeding technology shows the costs of breeding a specific titan and how many days it takes. all titans are either gaia-born (all dreamwalker class) or argo-bred. you may have more than 1 titan of a given argo-bred class on the argo, but you cannot breed a titan of a given argo-bred class if you already have one onboard (but you can still gain it from other sources),. you can only take 1 titan of a given argo-bred class into battle, regardless of the number of titans of that class you have. when you use a technology ability to breed a titan, pay any associated costs (usually a dreamwalker titan), then write the titan’s class on the timeline the indicated number of days from the current day (a breeding advancement event). once you reach that day, during the advancement step, you resolve it and gain a new titan. a given technology card may be involved in only 1 breeding process at a time, so once you put a titan class on the timeline, you can only breed more titans from that technology card after that breeding advancement event is resolved. crafting titans using primordial cores is called fusing. some production facilities allow you to craft titans alongside gear cards. this requires 1 gaia-born titan (dreamwalker) and 1 specific primordial core. if you have these, pay this cost and immediately gain access to the new titan. named titans have a special quality; usually a pattern. when a titan is assigned a pattern (and in order to resolve some other effects) you must note the titan’s name. patterns override a titan’s basic trauma table or kratos table and may introduce new special rules or abilities. a titan can have more than 1 pattern, but if both patterns relate to the same game element, the newer one overrides the older (and that card is discarded). 7. story step resolve main story progression, timeline story events, mnemos breakthroughs and any secret codes you manage to find. all adventures triggered during this step are resolved using the adventure phase rules. main story progression is resolved during this step only if you fulfill all requirements on your current story card. usually, you then flip the story card to the other side or refer to a paragraph in your current storybook or on another game element. once resolved, discard all tokens on the current story card. clue cards from each cycle may influence the game. on their back is the number of the cycle they belong to and the number of the story (or doom) card they are introduced with. story events are either fixed story events (printed on your timeline), or added during the game. if there is a story event noted on your current day, find the passage it leads to in the storybook and read it. mnemos breakthroughs are pieces of your lost memories. once you gain enough mnemos nodes, you trigger the next mnemos breakthrough. special events do not lead to specific paragraphs, and are resolved by finding the relevant passage in the special events section of the storybook. secret codes may be resolved if you find the corresponding paragraph in the main story section of your current storybook. each secret code paragraph can usually only be resolved once. 8. doom step doom progression is resolved during this step only if you fulfill all requirements on your current doom cards. usually, you then flip the doom card to the other side or refer to a paragraph in your current storybook or on another game element. once resolved, discard exactly as many tokens on the current doom card as the requirement, and move all excess tokens to either the other side of the card (if progressing from side a) or the next doom card (if progressing from side b). if you’re on the b side of the last doom card of the cycle and your doom progresses one more time, you lose the game. 9. end step if you are on an unexplored tile, it becomes explored, and if you’re already on an explored tile, nothing happens.saving the campaign at the end of any campaign round step (though after the end step is best), you may save your game and end your current game session. on the argo sheet, note the number and letter of your current story card along with the number of gathered tokens (in parentheses), the number and letter of your current doom card along with the number of gathered tokens (in parentheses), and the number of the map tile the argo is on. on the last page of the sheet, to the right of the choice matrix, note any other map tile numbers relevant to the current story and doom cards, all numbers of map tiles with other game elements on them, and the current position of the adversary. note the current triskelion stats of each argonaut on their respective argonaut sheets. store your technology deck, projects deck, argo armory deck, exploration deck, mnemos vault, gained clue cards and all unlocked godform and summoning cards separate from other components of the same type. place all explored map tiles into the explored map space in the game insert. nymph summonings each nymph summoning has a corresponding tarot-sized summoning card and a matching summoning token. once you use a summoning, you use up 1 summon charge (mark a box in the summoning section of the argo sheet). you cannot use more than your current summon limit, which is on the technology card that allows you to perform summonings. if you gain a technology card with a higher summon limit, note it on the argo sheet in the box near the summoning section. once you use a summoning, it exhausts: write its name in the summonings section, next to the marked summon charge box. that summoning remains unusable until the next divine surge. if you gain access to a one-off summoning, you also gain a bonus , which can only be only used to summon that particular nymph (and that nymph can only be summoned once). that bonus does not get replenished during a divine surge; return the summoning card to the box after using it (unless you have unlocked it permanently). note the summoning’s name in the summoning section of the argo sheet (even if you already used it), but do not mark the box next to it to indicate that it is available and does not count towards your summon limit. if you gain a bonus that is not tied to a specific summoning, encircle one of the boxes to denote that it does not count towards the summon limit. summonings include the symbol, so your adversary moves towards the argo whenever you perform one. divine surges a divine surge is a periodic game effect that allows you to replenish available godforms, summonings, and summon charges. whenever you perform a divine surge, erase all marks and names from the godforms and summonings sections of the argo sheet. diplomacy each cycle has a different set of factions. note your current diplomacy score with different factions on the corresponding diplomacy track. whenever you gain or lose diplomacy with a faction, mark the appropriate space on the corresponding track. each track is divided into sections representing different diplomacy thresholds (like friendly or denounced).diplomacy triggers refer to your diplomacy threshold with the local faction (the faction whose symbol is in the bottom right corner of the map tile the argo is on). if there is more than 1 faction symbol on a tile, you can choose which of the local factions you want to take into consideration when applying modifiers and triggers. the effects are resolved only if your standing with this faction is within the specified range. the numbers in parenthesis above the track sections denote the diplomacy bonus/penalty you should apply if you are within a given threshold. whenever you test diplomacy, modify your result by the value of that bonus/penalty. if you ever reach the at war section of any faction’s diplomacy track, you can no longer gain or lose diplomacy with this faction. ignore all gains and losses of this faction’s diplomacy. gain and loss gained gear cards are added to the argo armory deck. if you gain one during a battle, the titan responsible can immediately equip that card (discarding any other if needed). if you gain a card with a possession keyword, the titan or argonaut must immediately equip it. gained technology cards are added to the technology deck. gained clue and ally cards are placed next to your current story and doom cards. gained mnemos cards are placed in the play area of the argonaut who gained them. if giving a mnemos card to any argonaut would exceed their limit of 2, it is instead added to the mnemos vault. gained tokens are placed in the appropriate area. game elements not represented by physical components are noted on the argo sheet or, if gained by a specific argonaut, on their argonaut sheet. when you lose a physical component, return it to the box, unless instructed otherwise. when you lose a game element not represented by a physical component, erase it from the appropriate sheet (if it is singular) or lower its value. some technology abilities contain the word save. a successful save test allows you to ignore gaining or losing a specific game element; this can be re-rolled using argo fate just like any other argo test. most save tests are influenced by your diplomacy bonus/penalty. each save ability can only be used once per a single instance of gaining/loss. however: • if you have multiple separate abilities that allow you to perform a save test for the same effect, you can use as many of them as you like during 1 instance. • if you gain/lose the same game element more than once in a day from different sources, you can use the same save ability for each of these gains/losses. • you cannot use save abilities to mitigate unavoidable gain or loss. if the gain/loss is listed in the text of an active ability, story choice or any other non-forced effect (it may use the word pay ), it is a voluntary gain/loss or payment and cannot be mitigated in any way. you can’t use save abilities or any other effects that would allow you to ignore any of these gains/losses. when you are instructed to gain/lose x as a group, distribute the specified statistic or element among all of the argonauts. it does not have to be distributed evenly.adventure phase there is no strict round sequence in the adventure phase. when you begin resolving a story paragraph, it marks the beginning of the adventure phase. never read story passages unless instructed. an adventure paragraph ends only if you are instructed to return to the voyage phase or there is no further paragraph mentioned. you must always resolve all chained paragraphs before you can perform any other actions or resolve further campaign steps. choice matrix whenever you are told to mark a choice matrix node, mark the appropriate space on your argo sheet with an x. you cannot mark a box twice. if the box is already marked, ignore this instruction. the choice matrix persists through all the cycles of the game. when you progress from one cycle to the next, carry over all marked choices to the choice matrix of your new argo sheet. party leader during each adventure, one of the argonauts must be the party leader. choose a leader as soon as they are referred to in the paragraph or when you are faced with a choice (whichever comes first). if you cannot reach an agreement, choose randomly. the leader breaks all decision ties during the adventure if the players cannot agree, are the most likely to be tested during the adventure, and resolve all other effects and choices that refer to the party leader. give the leader the priority target token as a reminder. they remain the leader until the end of this adventure. hub adventures besides the main story, most of the adventures will come from your cycle’s adventure hubs. you resolve a hub adventure each time you encounter an active adventure symbol. find the adventure hubs table on the first page of the current storybook, roll d10, and refer to the column corresponding to your current story. mark a box on an adventure track on the argo sheet (if all boxes are already marked, re-roll to choose a different hub), then go to the corresponding storybook chapter. there, you will find an adventure table listing all adventures available in a given hub. if the box you marked on the argo sheet has the or symbol inside, resolve the paragraph marked with the same symbol in this hub’s chapter. if the box you marked was empty, instead roll d10 again and consult the hub’s adventure table to find the adventure you have to resolve. mark a fated box next to the adventure’s name, then find it in the hub’s chapter and read it. once you find the correct paragraph, gain mnemos nodes, then read it. r&r adventures when you encounter an r&r adventure symbol during the expedition step go to the r&r (rest and recuperation) adventure chapter of the current storybook. roll d10 and consult the r&r adventure table to find the adventure you have to resolve. mark a fated box next to the adventure’s name, then find it in the r&r adventures chapter and read it. special events when instructed to resolve a special event, find an appropriately named passage in the special events chapter of your current storybook and read it.inward odyssey each cycle has its own inward odyssey story card: adventures which are your main source of godforms, summonings and patterns. there are 20 inward odyssey adventures per cycle. each time you gain argo knowledge , unlock the next adventure from the inward odyssey chapter of the current storybook. resolve this adventure at the end of the current step. you can place tokens on inward odyssey to gain additional . every 2 tokens generate 1 . in this case, resolve the inward odyssey at the end of the story step. when you encounter a requirement for an inward odyssey adventure you do not yet meet, stop resolving that adventure. later, when you meet the requirements, resolve it at the end of the current step (you do not need to gain additional ). if you have an unresolved inward odyssey adventure and gain another +1 , move to the next adventure on the card. note any inward odyssey adventures you had to omit on the argo sheet. once you move to the next cycle, you will change inward odyssey cards, and any stories you haven’t experienced are lost. mnemos when you gain a mnemos, find the card and write its title on your argonaut sheet. apply the skill bonuses (they are permanent as long as you have the card). write the paragraph number of the first mnemos breakthroughs above the breakthrough symbol on the corresponding mnemos track. from then on, you gain access to the card’s level 1 ability; level 2 and 3 abilities are unlocked by reaching the first and second mnemos breakthroughs. each argonaut can have a maximum of 2 mnemos cards. if you are told to gain one and you are already at the limit, give the card to another random argonaut. if all argonauts already have 2 cards, add the new mnemos to the mnemos vault. the least likely argonaut is the one with the least amount of mnemos cards (on a tie, the one with the least amount of mnemos nodes; on a further, choose randomly from the tied players). the most likely/strongest argonaut is the one with the most mnemos cards and mnemos nodes (on a tie, choose randomly from the tied players). fated mnemos cards and nodes do not count. mnemos nodes mnemos nodes are like experience points for your mnemos cards. each mnemos progress track goes from 1 to 10 nodes. the most common source of nodes is hub adventures. to gain a node, match one of the mnemos’s traits to the adventure’s trait (found on the right of the adventure title). when you are about to resolve a hub adventure, each argonaut with a mnemos card with the corresponding trait gains 1 node for that mnemos. mark the leftmost empty node on the argonaut sheet next to the mnemos’s title. an argonaut can only gain 1 node per adventure, regardless of the number of matching traits they have. if both of their mnemos cards have the corresponding trait, the node goes to the dominant mnemos (the one with the most nodes). on a tie, the player controlling the argonaut chooses. if you gain nodes past an unmarked breakthrough symbol, note them on the mnemos track, then resolve the breakthrough during the story step, then mark the symbol. this may lead to you resolving 2 breakthroughs during 1 story step, one after the other. mnemos breakthroughs mnemos breakthroughs are adventures initiated from an argonaut’s mnemos. during the story step, if all nodes to the left of a breakthrough symbol on your mnemos progress track are marked, and the symbol itself is unmarked, resolve the paragraph noted above the symbol, then mark the breakthrough symbol as resolved.mnemos only involve the argonaut the memory belongs to. read mnemos paragraphs alone, then decide if you want to read it out loud, or share as much as you wish, including your own interpretation of these events and tailoring them to better fit the kind of person you believe your argonaut to be. the main reward for resolving a mnemos breakthrough is learning more about your argonaut’s past and unlocking a new mnemos ability, but note additional unique rewards on your argonaut sheet. if you gain a gear card from a previous cycle as a mnemos breakthrough reward, it counts as a card from the current cycle, overriding its original cycle affiliation. resolved mnemoses and katharsis once you resolve the last breakthrough of a mnemos card, it becomes resolved. when your argonaut dies or leaves the argo, that mnemos does not return to the mnemos vault, but is put back into the box with other unused mnemos cards. if you reach a katharsis, you will gain a code; write this in the katharsis box on your argonaut sheet. mnemos vault the mnemos vault is a deck made up of all mnemos cards you have unlocked during the campaign which are not currently assigned to any argonaut. keep it separate from other mnemos cards. when an argonaut dies or leaves the argo for any reason, they return their unresolved mnemos cards to the vault. usually, when a new argonaut is introduced into the game, you assign them a mnemos card from the mnemos vault. fated mnemoses each argonaut can have 2 unresolved fated mnemos cards at once. they do not count as mnemos cards for the purposes of other effects, and do not count towards the 2 mnemos cards per argonaut limit. when you gain a fated mnemos, search the box for all of the fated mnemos cards associated with the cycle you are playing, shuffle them and draw a card. note it on your argonaut sheet as you would a regular mnemos. they are always gained black side up. the hindrance is a negative effect or limitation. if the effects of your 2 fated mnemos cards contradict each other, the one you gained earlier (on a higher position in your argonaut sheet’s mnemos section) takes precedence. skill penalties are applied to your argonaut sheet, and are applicable as long as you have the card. at the beginning of a hub adventure, each argonaut with at least 1 fated mnemos card with a matching trait gains 1 node for that fated mnemos (in addition to any node gained for a regular mnemos card). if traits match, each argonaut could gain 1 regular mnemos node and 1 fated mnemos node from a single adventure. a fated mnemos has no breakthrough adventures – if all the nodes to the left of the first breakthrough symbol are marked, it is automatically resolved during the story step. however, each resolved fated mnemos gives you a positive ability to write down on your argonaut sheet; then return the card to the fated mnemos deck. there is no limit to the amount of trauma growth abilities a single argonaut can have (you can gain the same one more than once, and their effects stack). dreams of pharos dreams of pharos (sometimes denoted by ) are adventures iusually added to the timeline as story events. a dream of pharos is resolved in the story step. go the dreams of pharos chapter of your current storybook. roll d10 and consult the dreams of pharos adventure table to find the adventure you have to resolve. mark a fated box next to this adventure’s name, then find it in the dreams of pharos chapter and read it. if you see a pharos delve prompt, start drawing cards from the major trauma deck, adding the numbers in the lower left corner of the cards. after each draw, you may decide to either stop the delve or to continue. if you continue, draw another card and add the number denoted on it. to succeed in a delve, the sum of your cards must be equal to or higher than the delve difficulty (in brackets), but lower than 16. if the total is at any point equal to or higher than 16, you immediately fail the pharos delve and resolve the fail: effect. if you decide to stop the delve before reaching 16, if the total is equal to or higher than the delve difficulty, resolve the success effect. otherwise nothing happens. when an effect tells you to use the pharos delve rules, resolve it in the same way (though it is not considered a pharos delve). there are 15 cards in a standard major trauma deck: a pair of each numbered 1-7, and a single 8. adventure tests to perform a test, roll d10. any bonuses to the result must be declared before you perform the test. if the result is equal to or higher than the test’s difficulty, it is a success; otherwise it is a fail. a natural 10 is always a success, and a natural 1 is always a failure. argonaut tests are performed by a specific argonaut (or each argonaut). when associated with a specific skill, modify the test result by your skill value. argonaut tests can be re-rolled using . argo tests are not resolved by a specific argonaut, and can be re-rolled by raising argo fate instead. in a group test, all the argonauts total their successes. the test usually has several outcomes: usually an outright failure (0-1 successes), a moderate success (2-3 successes) and a full success (4 successes). a fail: effect is applied to the individual argonaut who failed the test, not the whole group. if a choice, test, or roll is marked with the peril keyword, the party leader must make the decision, test or roll without consulting the other players in any way. adventure terrain each adventure hub has an associated terrain tile. consult the adventure terrain column in the same row as the adventure hub, then note the terrain’s placement instructions on the timeline, on the day of the earliest upcoming timeline battle (the terrain does not affect a battle triggered in any other way). if terrain is already noted for that day, ignore this instruction. during the battle setup of the timeline battle, place the corresponding terrain tile(s) on the board, after you place all battle-specific terrain tiles. this terrain tile(s) cannot overlap with titans, the primordial, or other terrain tiles. outer 3: place the tile only within 3 spaces from any board edge. inner 3: place the tile on any spaces that are not within 3 spaces of the board edge. fated boxes fated boxes are marked to denote that you have already encountered this part of the story. you mark a fated box in an adventure table immediately after you roll the associated number, before you proceed to resolving the adventure. if all fated boxes associated with a given adventure are marked, roll d10 again and resolve a different adventure instead. if the fated boxes of all adventures in any of the adventure tables have been marked, reset all of the boxes in this table. battle phase when instructed to resolve a battle, find the battle scenario corresponding to the primordial you’re facing in your cycle’s storybook. save your campaign first and set aside all elements not used during this phase. battle setup set up the battle board, shuffle the trauma, kratos, and moiros decks and place all of them in their spaces. place kratos tokens, d10 attack dice and d6 power dice within reach of all players. each player places their argonaut portrait, mnemos cards and triskelion in front of them (the triskelion does not reset at the beginning of battle). choose the titan you will control and take its titan sheet and miniature (it does not have to be the same titan you controlled in a previous battle). you cannot take more than 1 titan of the same argo-bred class into battle. players as a group assign gear cards from the argo armory to titans. each titan has 2 weapon slots, 2 support slots and 1 armor slot. you can also have up to 3 attachment cards attached to your titan sheet and up to 1 attached to each of your cards. each titan can only have 1 copy of the same support card. players choose their argo abilities. you may use as many as your argo ability (aa) limit allows. place these abilities next to the board, along with the indicated number of charge tokens. place the primordial sheet in its space near the board, and its routine and signature cards in their spaces (do not use the mnestis routine side, unless you are playing a mnestis theatre battle). divide the primordial’s ai and bp cards into 3 decks each (i, ii and iii). then place the decks numbered i on their spaces at the bottom of the board. place the decks numbered ii and iii directly below; these are escalation decks. find the trait cards for any traits not described on the primordial sheet and place them nearby as a reference. place the appropriate terrain cards near the board and the terrain tiles on the board as indicated with any additional terrain. place titans on the indicated titan starting positions. assign the priority target token to the titan with the highest rage (on a tie, choose). position the primordial as described in the scenario rules at the end of the storybook. regular primordials use evolution tracks and evolve during the campaign, usually from level 1-4. adversaries and cycle bosses are almost always fought on level 1 throughout the campaign, but their battles still change, as reflected by their battle tracks. you will usually either mark 1 evolution box or 1 battle box on the respective primordial’s track. resolve any additional escalations . on the battle board, something is adjacent if the space it is on shares at least 1 edge with the other space. distance is always measured in spaces and orthogonally, never diagonally. all rules apply unless specifically stated otherwise. battle sequence battles are resolved in a series of alternating primordial and titan rounds. they immediately end with the argonauts’ victory as soon as the primordial has suffered wounds equal to its wounds , and with the argonauts’ defeat as soon as all titans die or the argonauts decide to retreat.crit die whenever you perform an attack or evasion roll, one of the dice you roll must always be the white crit die. if you roll only 1 die, it is always the crit die. whenever you roll a natural 10 on the crit die, you gain a crit chance for that attack. if you successfully wound the primordial with a crit chance, ignore all other responses and instead resolve the critical . if you fail to wound, resolve responses as normal. crit chance: resolve this effect if you roll a natural 10 in the attack roll (on top of gaining the crit chance as normal). crit miss: resolve this effect if you roll a natural 1 in the attack roll. you may re-roll this die as normal, but crit miss effects must still be resolved. if you re-roll the crit die and roll a natural 1 again, resolve any crit miss effects an additional time. crit evade: resolve this if you roll a natural 10 in the evasion roll. crit evade fail: resolve this if you roll a natural 1 in the evasion roll. primordial round begin the battle with the primordial round. players as a group resolve instructions that dictate the primordial’s behavior. primordials always move first, then attack. a primordial’s diagram shows its front and rear spaces and the number of spaces it occupies. to find out if a titan or element is in front of the primordial, draw an imaginary line passing along the edges of the spaces occupied by the primordial miniature’s front. all spaces beyond this line in the direction the primordial is facing are in front. rear (r) designates only the spaces adjacent to the primordial, directly behind it (in relation to the front). spaces with basic trait icons show where those traits take effect. basic traits unavoidable knockback: the value of the unavoidable knockback done by the primordial if it ends its movement on the same space as a titan. blindspot: titans in blindspots are excluded from targeting, and they gain a +1 precision bonus to their attacks. weakspots. lumbering: the primordial is massive or nigh immovable, and cannot suffer pushback or knockback. vantage points: the primordial can be mounted. check the attributes and traits associated with the primordial’s current level (the roman numeral). the current level usually has all the traits of the previous levels. bonuses at bonus: increase the at of each bp card by this value. danger bonus: increase the dealt by each primordial attack (not by each hit) by this value. evasion dice bonus: increase the evasion dice value of each primordial attack by this value. escalations: at the start of battle, escalate the primordial a number of times equal to this value. the primordial’s signature card is its default attack; resolve this if instructed. its routine card is a special action it performs when there is no eligible target for any of the targeting lines on its current attack. all signatures and some routines are attacks, but they are not ai cards for the purpose of any other effects. 1. start of primordial round resolve any primordial effects that trigger at the start of the primordial round, in an order of the players’ choice.2. resolve ai 1. draw ai draw an ai card from the ai deck (the roman numeral is its level). 2. targeting read the lines in the targeting area, one by one from top to bottom, until you find the first one that you can resolve. do not check further targeting lines. to be the target, a titan must fulfill all requirements of a single targeting line. if there is no valid target for any of instructions, discard the ai card and the primordial performs its routine instead. if a primordial targets titans outside of their effective move and attack range, they still perform the movement, trying to get as close to their target as possible, then skip the attack step and go straight to the after attack step. an instruction to resolve an attack against a specific target overrules any targeting instructions. if a titan becomes a target, it remains the target until the end of that ai card. adjacent: the target is on a space that shares an edge with a space occupied by the primordial. board: all spaces on the board. closest: the target is the shortest distance from the primordial (counted through obstacles and red lines) among possible targets. furthest: the target is the furthest distance from the primordial (counted through obstacles and red lines) among possible targets. in front: any space in front and within los of the primordial. in range: the primordial can reach the target by moving a number of spaces up to its speed and perform an attack against it. in sight: the target is within los of the primordial. in/on x: the target is in the specified area or space. last to wound: the titan who was the last to successfully wound the primordial with an attack. least/most x: least or most value/amount of a stat/resource. not in/on x: the target is not in a specified area or space. no target: always resolve this instruction if no other targeting instruction is applicable. priority target: the target with the priority target token. with x: titan with a specific game element. x titans: specified number of titans. zone: all spaces in an indicated area. this triggers even if there are no titans within the indicated area. if 2 or more titans are equally viable targets and none of them is the priority target, players may choose which of them becomes the target. when the titan with the priority token dies, pass the token to a living titan with the highest rage . if there are multiple effects stating that a titan cannot lose the priority token, the titan that got it the earliest remains the priority target, and for the purpose of passing the token after the titan’s death, titans with such effects are treated as if their was 9. line of sight (los) to check los, draw an imaginary straight line between the corners of any spaces occupied by the attacker and target: • if it passes through or along the edge of an obscuring terrain space or a red line, or through a corner where 2 features connect diagonally, there is no los. • if it goes through a corner of an obscuring terrain space or the endpoint of a red line, there is los. • blindspots and vantage points are never in the primordial’s los. • a miniature never blocks los to itself or other miniatures.3. primordial movement if instructed, the primordial will try to move as close to the target as possible, up to its speed , stopping only when it becomes adjacent to it. if it is performing a ranged attack it stops as soon as it is within range. at the beginning of a move the primordial always turns to face the target first. a primordial always moves through the fewest number of spaces, and can move through any other components (including titans and terrain). it always moves orthogonally 1 space at a time. if the target is not in a straight line from it, it moves towards it cardinally, switching the movement axis after every space travelled until it reaches a position that would allow it to continue moving towards the target in a straight line. players may decide the starting direction (horizontal or vertical) of the movement. if 2 or more routes are considered equally short, the players choose which to use. if the primordial moves through a terrain tile with the destructible keyword, that tile is destroyed and removed from the board. if any effect causes the primordial to move past the board edge, it will continue to move along the edge prioritizing a direction that will initially lead it away from the most titans (if possible). a titan on a space the primordial moved through or onto suffers crash (+1 and knockdown). a titan on a space the primordial ends its movement on suffers crash and unavoidable knockback equal to the primordial’s in a straight line away from the primordial. this follows all normal knockback rules, but it cannot be lowered or ignored in any way other than effects that cause you to stop, or effects that specifically refer to unavoidable knockback. if there are 2 equally possible unavoidable knockback directions, the player chooses. move x: perform movement up to x spaces, instead of using the primordial’s speed . move to x: perform movement to the designated area or in the indicated direction, treating the primordial’s as unlimited. the primordial always turns towards its target when it begins and ends its move, before it performs an attack (unless it targets a zone), and in the designated direction as part of an instruction. the primordial doesn’t turn when it is being moved forcefully, during a simultaneous attack against 2 or more titans, or during a zone attack. 4. primordial attack an attack without a specific type is considered melee and requires adjacency. range attack x: can be performed against a titan within x spaces. simultaneous attack: performed against multiple targets. this is simultaneous, but each target performs a separate evasion roll in any order. sequential attack: performed against multiple targets, one at a time, in a specific order. a chain break during one of these attacks stops the sequence and invalidates any lingering attacks. if a sequential attack targets all titans in path, it happens during the primordial’s movement. move the primordial towards its target 1 space at a time, and when it would move onto a space occupied by a titan, instead of moving through it, stop, resolve an attack, then continue moving towards the original target. when it reaches its original target, resolve an attack against that target as well. primordial movement during this attack does not cause crash . if at any point the primordial stops on a space occupied by a titan, that titan suffers unavoidable knockback as normal. zone attack: performed against all titans in a designated zone. this is simultaneous, but each target performs a separate evasion roll in any order. a chain break during one of these attacks does not stop unresolved attacks against other titans. if a titan moves outside of the zone after you have already begun to resolve this attack against other titans in the zone, it does not stop an attack against it. zone x attacks all titans within x spaces horizontally, vertically and diagonally from the source of zone x. if a zone attack targets a specific titan, it still affects other titans in the designated area. the primordial is not considered inside the zone originating from it and neither are titans on vantage points. judgement: each of these mental assaults designates a specific skill test (if there are 2, the target chooses one), and they usually have unlimited range. a judgement is not an attack for the purpose of other effects and the target must resolve a test instead of an evasion roll; so it cannot be mitigated with an armor roll, be re-rolled using evasion re-rolls or blocked with block x. judgements can be modified by attack types. evasion roll the primordial always hits, unless the target manages to evade the attack. perform an evasion roll by rolling the specified number of dice (which must always include 1 crit die). any evasion bonus is added to the result of each die rolled, and any evasion re-rolls can be used to re-roll the specified number of dice. if you roll a crit during the evasion roll and have a crit evade ability, trigger that effect (multiple crit evade abilities can be triggered if they are from the same weapon). compare the results to the evasion roll difficulty. each result equal to or higher than the difficulty is a successful evade, and each result lower is a hit. if you have block x, you may trigger it now to ignore x hits. if you use any weapons with defensive capabilities during the evasion roll or attack consequences, that weapon becomes your active weapon until the end of this primordial attack. you can only have 1 active weapon at a time. if there are no hits, it is a full evade: skip to the after attack part of the ai card, and trigger all full evade: abilities. out of reach evade: if a titan moves outside of the attack’s effective range after becoming its target but before resolving an evasion roll, the attack cannot be performed and the evasion roll and any attack effects are not resolved. instead, the primordial resolves its movement towards the target, then proceeds straight to after attack actions and effects. attack consequences if the titan is left with at least 1 hit, trigger all the effects of the ai card in the order given. danger: gain the dealt danger , then resolve a trauma draw. other statistics and tokens: attacks may also deal , or tokens. this does not cause a trauma draw unless is also dealt. conditions, other effects and abilities: attacks may also cause you to gain a condition or other effect, or suffer the effects of abilities such as pushback or knockback. armor roll when you are dealt danger , if you have any gear cards with armor dice , you must perform an armor roll. roll power dice equal to the total of all armor dice on all of your equipped cards (remember that if you use a weapon to defend, you cannot use other equipped weapons during the same attack). subtract all symbols rolled from the total value of dealt. if this reduces your gain to 0, do not resolve a trauma draw. armor dice cannot be rerolled using rage .trauma draw consult the trauma table on your titan sheet and draw a trauma card of the corresponding severity. after resolving the effects, discard it to the bottom of its deck. if an effect tells you to resolve a trauma draw, draw a trauma card corresponding to your current danger level, without raising it (if it is 0, nothing happens). to draw an obol, shuffle the obol deck and draw a card. if you are ever forced to perform 2 or more obol draws at the same time, you die. if your danger goes over 9, raise it to 9, but for the following trauma draw treat it as if it was increased to the actual value you would reach. raising your over 9 always triggers a trauma/obol draw, even if it wasn’t dealt during an attack. if your danger temporarily goes up to 14 or higher, consult this massive danger chart (these effects stack): 14+ : add the you died horribly card to the obol deck. 18+ : add the your gruesome death becomes legend card to the obol deck. 21+ : add the your death transcends reality card to the obol deck. a card added to the obol deck is added immediately before resolving an obol draw and it remains there until the end of battle. windows of opportunity a card may give players windows of opportunity to react outside of their normal turn. whenever you see preceding an ai instruction, you may activate any number of reaction abilities in any order (but no more than 1 ability with the same name per titan) immediately before you resolve that instruction. chain break if a titan bonus attack or additional primordial attack is triggered during a primordial attack it causes a chain break and the original primordial attack immediately ends. if a titan moves out of its weapon’s effective range after it attacks the primordial but before it performs the power roll, it causes a chain break and the attack immediately ends. if a chain break happens during a titan attack, resolve the clear the kratos pool and second ability window steps before you proceed to resolving the effect that caused the chain break. titan bonus attacks are follow-up attacks and do not cause chain breaks. effect triggers some ai cards have additional or stronger effects depending on your titan’s fate level, as shown in a special banner. 5. after attack after attack effects are completely separate from the attack, so they are resolved even if the actual attack was fully evaded or not performed at all. the only things capable of canceling after attack effects are a chain break or the mercy rule. all after attack effects targeting a single titan affect the original target of the attack. an after attack that targets multiple titans is resolved against each of them, but if an attack includes an after final attack instruction, it only takes effect after resolving the attack against each of its targets. after resolving this attack effect (if any), discard the ai card. if there are no more cards in the ai decks, shuffle the discards to form the new ai deck. 6. end of primordial round resolve any further effects and unexhaust argo abilities.titan round a titan round always comes after a primordial round. 1. start of titan round resolve any game effects triggered at the start of the titan round, in an order of the players’ choice. 2. titan turns take turns activating titans in any order, one at a time, until each titan has acted. during their turn, a titan gets 1 combat action and 1 movement action , in any order. you must finish an action before you perform another, and unused actions are lost. if an effect/ability requires you to spend one or both actions, you can only spend one if it hasn’t been performed yet, and once spent it cannot be performed this turn. when your turn is over, turn your argonaut card 90º to the right. once all titans have taken their turns, return all argonaut cards to their normal positions and proceed to the primordial round. movement action move a number of spaces up to your titan’s speed . declare the space you want to reach, then move your titan, one space at a time, resolving the effects of terrain tiles as you move onto them. all movement is in cardinal directions. you cannot move through red lines, obstacle or chasm terrain tiles, or through other titans or the primordial. you cannot move onto the same space twice during one movement. a move-like ability allows you to move voluntarily without performing a movement action and is resolved as normal, but is not considered a for the purpose of other abilities/effects. all movement caused by an opposing force is involuntary and must be resolved up to its maximum value, unless another effect forces you to stop. titans can be involuntary moved through spaces occupied by other miniatures and obstacle terrain tiles. if a titan is involuntarily moved into a board edge, it continues to move along its edge, away from the source of the involuntary movement (if possible). if a titan ends involuntary movement on a space occupied by another titan, the other titan is displaced. if a titan is involuntarily moved onto a space with an obstacle terrain tile, it suffers crash . if the terrain is destructible, it is then removed from the board. if indestructible, it stays on the board. if a titan ends involuntary movement on a space with a chasm terrain tile or they are pushed onto such a space, they die. multiple effects reducing involuntary movement may be applied at the same time. combat action 1. declare attack and active weapon declare your attack, then choose one of your unexhausted weapon cards as an active weapon for this attack. you can only choose a weapon if your target is in its effective range and los. if a weapon does not have a ranged or reach keyword, it is considered melee. if you cannot choose a legal weapon or don’t have los, the attack ends, but does not cause a chain break. effective range is the distance in cardinal directions from the attacker to the target. melee weapons have a range of adjacency, so you have to stand next to the target to attack. reach x weapons have an effective range of x, and can be used when adjacent. ranged x–y weapons have an effective range of at least x and up to y spaces, and can usually not be used when adjacent 2. raise rage and check priority target raise your rage by 1. if your is now higher than the priority target’s, you become the new priority target and take the token.3. attack roll roll a number of d10 attack dice equal to the value of your weapon. increase the result of each die by your weapon’s precision bonus (you can use opening tokens from the kratos pool to gain extra precision). other effects may give you dice re-rolls. each die with a result equal to or higher than the primordial’s to hit value is a hit. if you hit with all your dice, it is a full hit and activates all full hit: abilities (except those on inactive weapons). all dice that are not hits are misses. if you miss with all your dice, it is a full miss. go straight to the clear the kratos pool step without resolving any further attack steps, then activate all full miss: abilities and immediately end the attack. a natural 10 is always a hit and a natural 1 is always a miss, no matter how many precision modifiers you apply. 4. first ability window the attacking titan activates applicable abilities from your kratos table, mnemos cards, your active weapon, and any other non- weapon cards equipped on your titan. 5. draw bp card draw the top card from the bp deck and reveal it (the roman numeral is its level). 6. power roll 6.1. create your power pool of power dice (and sometimes raw power points). then add your titan’s power die and any other bonuses from your kratos table, equipped non-weapon gear, mnemos cards and other applicable game effects. there are 3 tiers of power dice from lowest to highest: red, then black, then white. if you need to add a die to the power pool and there are no dice of that type available, instead roll a die that is 1 tier higher instead of 2 of those dice. 6.2. roll all the dice in your power pool. each symbol gives you 1 power. then add all the raw points you have. 6.3. make any power re-rolls. power dice cannot be re-rolled using fate , but other effects may grant you re-rolls. 6.4. use potentials. each result gives you 1 potential, which can be turned into using effects like break tokens. 6.5. resolve the power roll. total your points to find the total power of this attack. if this is equal to or higher than the current bp card’s at value, you deal a wound. if you gained a crit chance, you deal a critical wound instead. if the total number of wounds on the wound stack (including the one you just dealt) equals or exceeds the primordial’s wounds , the primordial is slain. the battle immediately ends with the argonauts’ victory; proceed to the aftermath. if your total power is less than the , you fail to wound. always resolve all wound: and fail: effects. 7. primordial responses if you scored a wound, resolve the wound response. if you failed, resolve the fail response. if you scored a critical wound, resolve the critical (and ignore all other responses). a primordial may also have an instinct response you have to resolve regardless of the power roll result (and in addition to any other normal response except a critical). if the response involves an attack, note its type and finish the current attack sequence. the new attack happens immediately after this one is resolved and will not cause a chain break. if multiple responses apply, resolve them in the order of your choice. responses are resolved by the primordial against the titan. a response is resolved regardless of the titan’s positioning, but if a titan isn’t adjacent to the primordial when they should resolve a knockback or knockdown response, that response is ignored.8. wounds and escalation if you failed to wound the primordial, place the bp card you targeted on top of the bp discard pile and do not perform escalation. skip this step and continue to resolve the attack. if you wounded the primordial, perform escalation. this is the process of adding more powerful cards to the bp and ai decks. if you wound a bp i or bp ii card, place it faceup on top of the wound stack. this is a single wound. if you wound a bp iii card, place the generic double wound card on top of the wound stack and set the wounded bp iii card aside. it will return to the bottom of the deck after escalation. if you critically wound a bp iii card, place it on top of the wound stack instead; each one in the stack counts as 2 wounds. if an effect instructs you to deal an additional single wound, place a generic single wound card on top of the wound stack, in addition to any other wounds you’ve dealt. escalating the bp deck: in general, when the current bp card leaves the bp deck to become a wound, take a random bp card of a higher level from the bp escalation deck and shuffle it into the bp deck. if the new bp card would end up as the only card in the deck, shuffle in the bp discard pile too. escalating the ai deck: search the deck and discard pile for a card matching the wounded bp card’s level and remove it from the battle. then take a random ai card of 1 level higher and shuffle it into the ai deck. if there is now only 1 card in the deck or you removed a card from the discard pile, shuffle the discard pile into the deck. if there are no ai cards that match the level of the bp card, remove a card of 1 level higher and escalate based on that card. this will lead you straight from a level i card to level iii. if there are no more current or higher-level cards to escalate, you will add a permanent stat bonus instead. if you are instructed to search a deck and discard pile for a card, always prioritize cards from the deck. check the full escalation chart on p53 of the rulebook for rules for special cases. if an effect instructs you to escalate the primordial even if there is no wound, or even outside of a titan attack, perform the escalation as normal, but since no wound was dealt, remove the lowest bp card from the battle. if an effect instructs you to escalate the primordial outside of battle, note it, then perform the escalations during battle setup, as normal, but since no wound was dealt, remove the lowest bp card from the battle. 9. clear the kratos pool after resolving responses and performing escalation, remove all tokens from the kratos pool. 10. second ability window your attacking titan activates applicable abilities from your kratos table, mnemos cards, your active weapon and any other non- weapon cards equipped on your titan. only the attacking titan may activate abilities during this window, unless stated otherwise. you can use most of the abilities that place tokens in the kratos pool (such as opening x or break x) to support the other players. the current titan attack then ends. if the bp card was not wounded (did not go to the wound stack), discard it now. if the attack triggered an attack response, it happens next, starting a new attack sequence. 3. end of titan round resolve any further effects and unexhaust argo abilities.other actions in the titan round complicated actions use both and together and can only be performed if the titan can perform both actions and still has at least 1 unused action of each type during their turn. you cannot perform other actions during a complicated action. free actions can be performed in your turn without spending your or . you can perform as many different free actions as you want, before your and or between them, but each of them can only be performed once per turn. reactions may be performed during a window of opportunity and allow titans to act during the primordial round. argo abilities are technologies that can be used during the battle. your aa limit is dictated by your current excursion propylon technology. if you research another such technology, apply only the one that allows you to use the most argo abilities and change your aa limit on your argo sheet. each argo ability gains a number of charges at the start of battle; discard one of its charges each time you use it. once it is out of charges, it cannot be used again during the current battle. argo abilities can be used during any moment of the titan round (not in the middle of other actions), though some specify a time. you can use any number of the active argo abilities each round, but each can be used only once per round. after using an argo ability, exhaust it. it automatically unexhausts at the end of the current (primordial or titan) round. battle aftermath gaining primordial resources generally, you gain the resources shown in the upper right corner of every bp card on the wound stack times the primordial level. you also gain 1 primordial core resource for each bp iii card in the wound stack, with a core type corresponding to the primordial you faced. if you fought a level 3 or 4 primordial, you also gain bonus ambrosia resources, as noted in the corresponding level stat block on the primordial sheet. if there are any generic single wounds and/or double wounds in the stack, first combine the bp discard pile with the bp deck and separate them by level. for each set aside single wound, draw 1 random bp of the lowest available level and gain its resources. for each set aside double wound, draw 1 random bp iii and gain its resources (you do not gain cores for these bp iii cards). death blow: if the primordial was slain by a crit effect that caused it to die instantly, and the number of wounds in the wound stack is lower than its wounds , add the top card from the bp deck to the stack as if it was wounded (use double wounds instead of bp iii cards). if this causes the number of wounds to become equal to or higher than , proceed to gaining resources as normal. otherwise, escalate the bp deck as if you just wounded that bp card, then repeat this process. continue until the number of wounds in the stack is equal to or higher than the primordial’s . note the new resources on your argo sheet. the battle aftermath may indicate you gain additional resources. casualties note the loss of any titans on the argo sheet. discard all conditions and tokens on titan sheets (resolve all end of battle effects before you discard condition cards). tides of fate each argonaut resets their triskelion values to 0. lower the argo’s value by the indicated number (in cycle i, this is usually -2 ). shuffle the exploration deck shuffle all exploration cards removed from the exploration deck due to the timeline battle special disposal effect back into the deck. additional battle rules death in battle when you die in battle you only lose the titan you are currently using; it is removed from the board (note its loss on the argo sheet) and then cannot be used in any way. do not discard its conditions and tokens or reset its triskelion until instructed to do so. events may result in the argonaut dying; consult the current cycle’s rude awakening special event. never discard the argonaut sheets, as some events might reference them later. ways to die include: • drawing a heroic death, heroic life or disemboweled trauma cards or another death-inducing card. • drawing a you died obol card, or being forced to perform 2 obol draws at the same time. • being forced to draw a second moiros or kratos during a battle. • gaining ambrosia tokens over the ambrosia limit (usually 5), or having 4 despair tokens while not adjacent to another titan. • going beyond the board edge or into a chasm space, or being forced to displace when there is no legal space to displace to. if a titan dies (mercy rule): • during an attack against the primordial, you ignore all negative responses elicited by that attack. • during a primordial attack, the primordial ends its attack, forgoing all lingering attack effects and after attack effects targeting that titan. if a titan dies, but the attack has an effect that is separate from the target or has other targets, continue to resolve those effects. other round timing rules start of battle: resolve this effect after you finish battle setup, but before the first round begins. end of battle: resolve this effect when the battle ends (regardless of its outcome), before you proceed to the battle aftermath. when: resolve this effect after you resolve the effect it refers to (or, sometimes, when you begin to resolve it), but before any other actions or effects. when you are about to: occurs immediately before you resolve the effect that is about to happen. this does not invalidate the triggering effect, even if it causes a chain break. other effects with a specific trigger must be resolved after the trigger occurs, before resolving any effects other than the ones caused or enabled by it. bonus attacks bonus attack effects allow you to perform an immediate attack, often outside of your turn, and most cause a chain break. for a bonus attack you may declare an exhausted weapon as your active weapon. if you do, unexhaust it, then continue the attack. during a bonus attack you may ignore attack responses to it. when the attack ends, continue resolving the battle round that was interrupted. all other combat action restrictions and rules apply. a bonus attack during a titan attack is also called a follow-up titan attack and is resolved immediately after the current titan attack ends (no chain break). all other bonus attack rules apply. instant death effects are special effects that cause a titan to die immediately, without drawing an obol or a trauma card. death blows are critical effects that allow you to slay the primordial before dealing all required wounds. retreat most battles allow players to retreat, but usually only after at least 2 titans have died. a retreat is treated as a defeat, but allows you to save the remaining titans to fight another day. a retreat is not possible in most battles against adversaries and boss primordials.sisyphus tears when a battle ends, players may decide to spend 1 sisyphus tear to replay it, without suffering any of its consequences: do not lose titans, gain or resolve end of battle effects. restore the game to its starting state (including any spent godforms and summonings); you can change titans, loadouts, and argo abilities. wise providence wise providence is a rare temporary boon that allows the battle to begin with a titan round instead of a primordial round. it generally impacts the next battle only; note it on the timeline, on the day of the first upcoming timeline battle. if it refers to a specific battle, note it in the boons, afflictions, notes section of the argo sheet. conditions place any condition card you gain next to your titan sheet. if it also requires you to gain condition tokens, place them on the card. all conditions are discarded during the casualties step of the battle aftermath. some conditions may have additional end of battle: effects that trigger if you were unable to get rid of them before the battle ended. if you gain a condition card outside of battle, it remains active until the end of the next battle. you cannot gain a condition if you already have it, but some conditions trigger additional effects if you gain them again. afflictions and boons negative afflictions are permanent and you can only remove them if explicitly instructed. positive boons can be personal traits, equipment or allies. note both on your argonaut sheet. moiros cards when any effect requires you to raise your fate over 9, shuffle the moiros deck and draw a random card. keep this card until the end of battle (even if its effects aren’t lasting). if you are forced to draw another moiros card while you have one, you die instead. kratos cards when you draw a kratos card, shuffle the deck and draw a random card. keep this card until the end of battle (even if its effects aren’t lasting). if you are forced to draw another kratos card while you have one, you die instead. if you must perform a kratos roll, roll d10. if the result equals or exceeds your rage , you succeed. if it is lower, you fail and you must draw a kratos card. you cannot re-roll this using fate . ambrosia when you gain an ambrosia token, place it on your titan sheet. your ambrosia limit is usually 4. if you have multiple elements that modify this limit, choose the one with the highest limit, then apply any bonuses and penalties to that limit. if the number of ambrosia tokens on your titan sheet is ever higher than your ambrosia limit, the titan dies. fatigue as long as you have a fatigue token, you can use the corresponding action only to discard the token. you cannot gain a fatigue token if you already have one. after you discard it, if you have any actions remaining, you can perform them as normal. modifier tokens use the appropriate red (-1) or blue (+1) modifier token when marking changes to attributes: precision , evasion , at , speed , evasion , danger , to hit . place temporary titan modifier tokens on their triskelions as a reminder. place temporary primordial tokens in the kratos pool and remove them in the clear the kratos pool step of a titan attack. stack generic tokens under them to indicate larger modifiers. you can also use generic tokens to mark exhausted abilities or cards.gear there are 4 types of gear cards: weapons: all gear carried by titans in their hands count as weapons (including shields). they occupy 1 hand slot , 2 hand slots or 3 hand slots . titans usually have 2 weapon slots. armor : defensive gear usually grant armor dice , evasion bonus , evasion re-rolls or a combination of these defensive statistics. titans usually have 1 armor slot. support : abilities and effects that don’t usually have defensive or offensive statistics. titans usually have 2 support slots. attachment : these cards must be attached to another game element, and may modify that element, apply additional effects or give access to new abilities. usually, a titan sheet can have up to 3 and each other card can have up to 1 . if a game element is exhausted or lost, its attachments are as well. if an effect is limited by charges, at the start of battle, place tokens on the card equal its value. when you are instructed to spend a charge, discard 1 token. if there are none left on a card, you cannot use its abilities that require you to discard a charge. each titan can use 1 fists card. after performing gear loadout, if your titan has any free hand slots, you may equip a fists card. if, at any point of the battle, you lose your weapon card(s), you may immediately equip a fists card. when a titan is about to declare an active weapon during an attack, you may choose to discard one or more of your equipped weapon cards to equip a fists card. if, at any point of the battle, you gain a weapon card that uses up the hand slot(s) occupied by fists, you must set the fists card aside; it is then no longer equipped. fists can be exhausted or discarded like any other gear card. awakenings once you gain access to the forlorn naos technology, you unlock the ability of titans to awaken. you also permanently add the awakening grave trauma to the trauma deck and switch the you died obol with its special variant. whenever an effect instructs you to awaken, choose an available godform and place its card over the illustration on your titan sheet. note its name in the godform section of the argo sheet and mark the box to denote that it becomes unavailable until the next divine surge. if there are none available, you cannot awaken. as soon as you awaken, immediately: • perform a chain break. • gain the priority target token. as long as you are awakened, you cannot lose this token. • discard any condition cards and tokens, as well as despair tokens (but not ambrosia tokens). • if you were knocked down, you may stand up. • gain trespass tokens equal to the value in the bottom right of your awakening card (usually 2). • you may immediately perform a move or pushback up to your and perform a bonus attack. these are not regular actions. instructions that allow you to awaken always include the , symbol, so your adversary moves towards the argo. these rules apply to you as long as you are awakened: • when you perform a power roll, add the godform power die to the power pool instead of your titan power die. • gain all other bonuses listed at the bottom of the godform card. • if the godform allows you to perform a special attack, this uses stats and effects given on the godform card and cannot be combined with your weapons. for this attack, the godform card is your active power (instead of an active weapon).• when you are about to perform an obol draw, shuffle the you live: by the power of the dead gods card into the obol deck. remove it from the deck when you finish resolving the draw (you only get 2 you live! obol cards during your obol draws). • if you are ever knocked down while awakened, during your turn, you may discard 1 token to immediately stand up. at the start of your turn you must discard 1 trespass token from your godform card. if you cannot, return the godform card to the supply and lose all its bonuses. then, if you awakened as a result of an obol draw, you die. if you have awakened through any other means, after you end your awakening, continue resolving your turns as normal. summonings in battle any summoning requirement that needs to be met before you are able to perform it always refers to the current battle. if a summoning does not specify the moment it can be used, it can be used like an argo ability, during the titan round. summonings include the symbol, so your adversary moves towards the argo whenever you perform one. vantage points some primordials allow you to create vantage points (vps), spaces on top (or inside) of them. titans can climb them to strike vital body parts, avoid primordial attacks or enable other effects. the primordial vp must first be created before it can be used. when a vp is created, remove the interchangeable part of the primordial miniature and switch it with the vantage point part (or just use the vp space marked on the primordial sheet). if a primordial has no associated vp description, you cannot create vps on it by any means. a titan adjacent to a primordial with an unlocked vp on it may perform a climb test as a free action. the skill specified on the primordial sheet. if you succeed, place your titan on the vp space. at the end of the primordial round, most vps force you to perform a hold on test to find out if you fall down. only 1 titan can occupy a single vp at a given time. a titan may move from a primordial vp space to a space adjacent to the primordial using a or any move-like ability, as if they were adjacent spaces. if a titan suffers knockdown or involuntary movement while on a vp space, they are first displaced to a space adjacent to the primordial. titans on vps are considered adjacent and in range 1 to the primordial and all titans adjacent to that primordial. they measure range to other titans/elements from the space occupied by the primordial that is closest to that titan/element. other titans adjacent to the primordial are not considered adjacent to titans on vps. exhausting/discarding/removing when you exhaust a card, turn it 90º to the right. it is still treated as equipped, but you cannot use it as an active weapon, use its defensive statistics, or activate any of its abilities except effects triggered by exhaustion or unexhausting. passive abilities remain in effect even their card is exhausted, and traits are always active. cards remain exhausted until they are unexhausted by another effect. each argonaut may spend their movement action or combat action to unexhaust all exhausted equipped game elements. when you discard a token, place it back in the token pool. when you discard a card, flip it facedown; it is unusable until the end of this battle and it is not treated as equipped. when you remove or archive an element, return it to the box, where it will not be used again this playthrough unless it is only removed for a specific duration.tests in battle to perform a test, roll a d10 and compare the result to the test’s difficulty. a test associated with a specific argonaut skill allows you to increase the result by your skill value. tests can be re-rolled using fate . any bonuses must be declared before the roll. abilities active abilities active abilities require you to pay a cost (given before the ability): • using a combat, movement, or complicated action. • gaining +1 fate . • exhausting the game element providing the ability. • discarding the game element providing the ability. • discarding a charge . active ability usage is always voluntary, so the costs can never be prevented or ignored by the use of other effects. active abilities that do not have a specific timing condition can be used as a free action. you can use each available active ability on a single game element once per round. constant abilities constant abilities do not have a cost and must be resolved anytime the specified condition is met. you must resolve keywords that place kratos tokens in the kratos pool, and keywords that hinder you in any way. you may use abilities that grant you move- like abilities or allow you to forcefully move the primordial. constant abilities with a specific timing condition can be used multiple times during the same round. if the ability has a dual dual timing conditions, you may use it in either window, but not in both. constant abilities without a specific timing condition are passives and have an ongoing effect kratos table abilities kratos table abilities do not have a cost and are represented by icons in the kratos tables. each is gated by your current level. you can apply bonuses from each kratos table level equal to or lower than your current rage . if a level gives you options you can use only one. symbols linked with a plus sign are both part of the same option. when you reach the second ability window of your attack, you must apply applicable effects from each level of the kratos table that is still available (if it says you may, you can apply the ability, then decide not to resolve its effect). named abilities you cannot use multiple abilities with the same name at the same time (unless they are stackable keywords). you can use multiple active abilities with the same name during a single round, provided that they come from different game elements (as each single active ability can only be used once per round). primordial abilities restrictions on ability usage do not apply to primordials. all ai and bp card abilities are resolved by the primordial against a titan. pattern cards when a pattern card is applied to a titan, note that titan’s name on an argonaut sheet and note its pattern. this connection is permanent. if a titan with a pattern dies, that pattern is lost. terrain terrain tiles are made of spaces. unless stated otherwise, resolve a tile effect when entering the first space of a tile. like a miniature, a tile does not block los to itself.terrain tiles can be placed or destroyed during battle. when a tile is destroyed, remove it from the board. when one is placed and all the tiles of that type are already on the board, remove the tile furthest from the primordial, then place it on the indicated spaces. when a terrain tile is placed on a space occupied by another terrain tile, if the other tile is indestructible, you cannot place anything on top of it, so ignore this new tile placement. in all other cases the other tile is destroyed before you place the new tile. when a terrain tile is placed on a space occupied by a titan, if the tile has the obstacle and destructible keywords, it is destroyed and the titan suffers crash . if the tile has just the obstacle keyword, the titan suffers crash and is displaced to an adjacent space in a way that would allow the tile to be placed without overlapping. if there is no such space, the titan cannot be legally displaced and dies. in all other cases the terrain tile is simply placed underneath the titan miniature and this titan must immediately resolve this tile’s effects (if any) as if it had just moved onto it. if a terrain tile is placed on a space occupied by the primordial, if the tile is indestructible, it is placed as normal. in all other cases the terrain tile cannot be placed (ignore this tile placement). terrain abilities all these abilities are forced and must be resolved each time they are triggered. if an ability has no trigger, its effect is constant and always active as long as this tile is present on the board. ambrosia: when a titan ends its movement on this tile (voluntarily or not), it gains 1 ambrosia token. if a titan starts its turn on this tile and doesn’t move until the end of this turn, it gains 1 ambrosia token. if a titan moves through this tile but does not end its movement on it, test 6+. if you fail, gain 1 ambrosia token. boundless: you cannot voluntarily move onto this tile. if you would be forced to move onto or beyond this tile or board edge, you die. chasm: titans cannot voluntarily move through chasm spaces. if a titan ends their movement on a chasm, it dies. if it is pushed back or pulled through a chasm space, it dies. if a chasm tile is placed under a titan, it dies. titans do not die from moving over a chasm during knockback unless they end their movement on it. cover: titans on this tile have +1 evasion . destructible: when a titan is involuntarily moved onto this tile, the tile is destroyed. if a titan is knocked back, it ignores non-obstacle terrain tiles it moves through, so it will not destroy a destructible tile unless it ends its movement on it.

8,31260,AGRICOLA,2008,Z-MAN GAMES,3.6363,6230,"setup place the 3 boards as shown in the rules. each player chooses a color and takes the playing pieces in that color, plus 1 farmyard. each player places a wooden hut room tile and a family member disc on each of the 2 building spaces on their farmyard. sort the cards into decks: green action cards, blue round cards, yellow occupation cards, orange minor improvement cards, red major improvement cards, grey begging cards, and summary cards. sort the blue round cards according to the stages, shuffle each pile, and place the piles on top of one another in order with stage 6 at the bottom. if playing with 3-5 players, take the corresponding set of green action cards and place them faceup on the spaces to the left of the first board, in any order. in solo and 2 player games, no action cards are used. the purple symbol on the left of the yellow occupation cards shows how many players the card is used for. cards not used are removed from the game (the full deck is only used in a 4-5 player game). shuffle the cards and deal each player a hand of 7 cards. shuffle the orange minor improvement cards and deal each player a hand of 7 cards. place the 10 red major improvement cards faceup on the major improvements board. as soon as 9 have been bought, the board is turned over to show the scoring overview and the remaining improvement placed on it. place the grey begging cards faceup beside the play area. each player takes a summary card. choose a starting player who receives the starting player marker and 2 food. the other players each receive 3 food. apart from the 5 family member discs, 4 stables and 15 fences per player, all other components are considered unlimited. use a multiplication marker if necessary by placing it under one of the appropriate good markers. pla ying the game there are 6 stages divided into 14 rounds. each round has 4 phases. 1: st ar t the round draw a round card and place it on the appropriate space on the board. its action is available to all players, and can be used on this and all subsequent rounds. then play all actions that occur at the beginning of a particular round or every round. if there are tiles, food or other pieces on the space for the current round, they are distributed to the appropriate players.2: replenish goods & animals place new goods and food on any action spaces on the board that require them, as indicated by an arrow (printed spaces as well as action and round cards). add new goods and food to any existing goods and food. 3. w ork in clockwise order beginning with the starting player, players take turns moving a single family member from their farmyard, placing it on an unoccupied action space and taking that action. this continues until all family members have been placed. only 1 family member may ever be placed at a time, and each space may only be occupied by 1 family member in one round. if a space is occupied, its action must be performed. animals must be placed directly into the player’s farmyard. if they cannot, they must be returned to the general supply or converted into food (if possible). played cards or bought major improvements must be read aloud to all players. players may not hide their personal supplies or cards they have played. 4. return home players return their family members to their home. the harvest consists of 3 phases and occurs at the end of each stage of the game (after rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14). harvest phase 1: the field players remove 1 grain or vegetable token from each sown field in their farmyard and place them in their supply. players may receive additional food from played occupation or improvement cards. harvest phase 2: feeding the family at the end of this phase, each player must pay 2 food per family member. offspring born during the current round only consume 1 food this round. each unprocessed grain or vegetable may be converted to 1 food at any time. unprocessed animals have no food value. a player who cannot or will not produce the required food must take a begging card for each missing food. family members may not be given up to avoid feeding them. harvest phase 3: breeding any player with at least 2 animals of the same type (they need not be together) receives 1 additional (baby) animal of that type, but only if it can be accommodated in the farmyard or an appropriate improvement card. animals may not be converted into food immediately after the birth (they run away if they cannot be accommodated).the a ctions four main types of action may be taken to improve your farmyard. some of these only come into play at certain stages, as indicated by the round card. a: extend & reno v a te w ooden huts build room(s): extend your hut by building orthogonally adjacent rooms. new rooms must be made from the same material as the rest of the house. you may also build up to 4 stables for 2 wood each. renovation: renovate your hut from a wooden hut to a clay hut (turn the tiles over), or a clay hut to a stone house (replace the tiles with stone house tiles). you may only renovate a complete hut, not individual rooms, and each renovation action allows only a single renovation to the next hut or house type. b: famil y gro wth family growth: add your newborn family member to the action space. in the return home phase, it is placed in the home. the new family member is not available for use in the round when it is born. families are limited to 5 members; if you have this many in play you may not choose this action. after family growth, also 1 minor improvement: you must have more rooms in your home than you have family members to take this action. the improvement cannot be purchased without the family growth. family growth even without room in your home: you may grow your family regardless of the number of rooms in your home. c: plo w & so w f ields plow 1 field: take a field tile and place it on an empty space in your farmyard. if you already have fields, it must be placed orthogonally adjacent to an existing field. you may use at most 1 plow improvement each time you select this action. take 1 grain: take 1 grain and place it in your supply. take 1 vegetable: take 1 vegetable and place it in your supply. sow (grain): plant 1 or more fields by taking 1 grain from your supply and 2 grain from the general supply and placing them on an empty (fallow) field. sow (vegetable): plant 1 or more fields by taking 1 vegetable from your supply and 1 vegetable from the general supply and placing them on an empty (fallow) field. a harvested field does not need to be replowed to be resown using the sow action. sow and/or bake bread: you may choose to sow grain, bake it into bread (convert it to food) or leave it in your supply. baking bread requires an improvement with the appropriate symbol."
9,332321,ALIEN: FATE OF THE NOSTROMO,2021,RAVENSBURGER,1.9808,52,"setup place the nostromo board on the table. place the morale marker on the board's crew morale track, on the space corresponding to the number of players. place 2 scrap tokens at each of the following locations: garage, mu-th-ur, medbay and maintenance. create a scrap pile next to the game board with all remaining scrap tokens. shuffle the concealed tokens and place 1 token facedown at each of the following locations: garage, workshop and maintenance. place the remaining concealed tokens facedown in a stack next to the board. place 1 coolant canister token at each of the following locations: workshop, garage, maintenance, equipment storage, mu-th-ur and hyper sleep. lay out the flashlight, motion tracker, electric prod, incinerator, grapple gun and cat carrier items to the side of the board. shuffle the objective cards and reveal 1 card for each player plus 1 additional card and place them at the top of the board. return the remaining objective cards to the box. if you are playing solo, remove the final mission cards cut off every bulkhead and every vent and blow it out into space. shuffle the final mission cards and draw 1 card at random. place it facedown next to the revealed objective cards. return the remaining final mission cards to the box. shuffle the encounter cards and place them next to the board. optionally, place ash in the medbay. each player chooses a crew placard and corresponding figure. each player takes a player reference card. all crew members start the game in the galley. the player who most recently had a cat hiss at them goes first. otherwise, the oldest player goes first. how to play the game is cooperative and all players win or lose together. complete all the starting objectives to reveal the crew's final mission. you must meet all the requirements of the revealed final mission to win the game. the players lose immediately if one of the following events occurs: crew morale failure: if the crew morale track reaches 0, the crew have run out of hope and cease to function.self-destruct: if the self destruct track reaches 4 counters, the ship is immediately destroyed. each objective card has a task that must be completed to finish that objective. after the crew succeeds in completing the task(s) listed on the objective card, flip that card facedown. once all your starting objectives are facedown, reveal the final mission card. game play starting with the player going first, each player resolves a complete turn. each turn has 2 phases, performed in order. after a player completes both phases, play proceeds clockwise, beginning with the next player's crew action phase. 1. crew action phase on your turn, take a number of actions up to the number indicated on your crew placard. you may take fewer if you wish. actions may be taken in any order and the same action can be performed multiple times in a turn. move move your crew member into an adjacent corridor or an adjacent room, or use ladders to travel to different levels. pick up/drop you may use 1 action to pick up or drop any number of scrap tokens, or to pick up or drop 1 item. when picking up scrap tokens or items, place them in your inventory. you may carry up to 3 items, 1 coolant canister, and any number of scrap tokens. when dropping scrap tokens or items, place them in the room or corridor you currently occupy. use an item some items require an action to use them. special action some crew members have special actions. special actions count as one of the total number of actions for your turn and can be taken multiple times unless specified otherwise. craft to craft an item, discard scrap tokens equal to the item's cost from your inventory into the scrap pile, then take the item and place it faceup in your inventory. trade all crew members in the same room or corridor may give or take any number of scrap tokens or items to or from each other. 2. encounter phase draw 1 encounter card from the top of the encounter deck, resolve all parts of the card from top to bottom, then place it faceup in the enounter deck's discard pile. action perform any action as stated on the card. place tokens if the encounter card instructs you to place tokens: 1. if there is no concealed token already in the area, place a concealed token from the stack in that space facedown. 2. then place any scrap tokens from the scrap pile in the specified area. if an encounter card instructs you to place a concealed token in a space a crew member is currently located, place the token without revealing it. crew members may leave the room without revealing the token, but if any crew member enters the room, the token must be revealed. alien encounter move the alien the number of spaces indicated toward the nearest crew member along the shortest path. the alien can use ladders just like the crew. if multiple crew members are at the same distance from the alien, the crew decides which one the alien moves towards. if the alien encounters a crew member, the alien stops moving. when the alien encounters crew members, they lose morale equal to the morale listed on the encounter card, and the crew morale marker moves down a corresponding number of places. the crew members who encountered the alien must immediately flee by moving 3 spaces away in a direction of their choice. when fleeing, a crew member may have to into a room that contains a concealed token. if so, the fleeing crew member stops, then reveals the concealed token and resolves it. it may be impossible to avoid encountering the alien during a player's crew action phase. if a crew member encounters the alien in the crew action phase, morale decreases by 2, and the affected crew member flees 3 spaces. the current player's crew action phase is now over. encountering a concealed token when a crew member moves into a room that contains a concealed token, first check to see if any objectives have been completed. then reveal the concealed token. safe nothing happens. shuffle this token back into the stack. surprise attack move the alien into the room immediately. decrease morale by the amount indicated on the concealed token. any affected crew members must flee 3 spaces and the current player's crew action phase immediately ends. skip the encounter phase when a turn ends this way. shuffle this token back into the stack. jonesy jonesy immediately hisses at the crew member, decreasing morale by 1. shuffle this token back into the stack. morale various effects within the game cause the crew to lose morale. if morale is lost, move the tracker down. if the crew's morale runs out, they are unable to continue, and the game is immediately lost. completing objectives most objectives require 1 or more items to be brought to a location. to complete an objective, a crew member needs to have the item in their inventory and move to that location. they do not have to drop the item or use the item at that location. other objectives may require you to drop items in a location. after the item is dropped and the objective is completed, you may pick up that item again. final mission once all starting objectives are completed, the final mission is revealed. each final mission has specific requirements that must all be achieved simultaneously for the crew to succeed. if the crew succeed at completing all final mission objectives, they win the game. some final missions may introduce conditions that must be avoided, or the crew will immediately lose the game. self-destruct track some final missions initiate the nostromo's self-destruct sequence. the crew member whose turn it is places the self- destruct track in front of their crew placard with 4 countdown tokens on it. at the beginning of each of their subsequent turns, remove a countdown token. if you can't remove a token, the nostromo is destroyed and the crew lost. optional: ash for a more challenging game, add ash. whenever ash moves, he uses the shortest route to move towards the nearest room or hallway with any scrap tokens or a crew member – whichever is closest. on a tie, the crew decides which one ash moves towards. if ash encounters a space with scrap, he will stop and remove all scrap (place them into the scrap pile). if ash encounters any crew, he will stop, and each crew member sharing space with ash must discard 1 scrap token or decrease morale by 1. lose 1 morale for each each crew member unable to discard a scrap token. if a crew member stays in the same space as ash, ash is prevented from moving. the crew member will not need to discard scrap or lose morale. if you reveal the final mission you have my sympathies, the rules for ash change. he no longer moves toward scrap, or stops and removes it when he moves into a space with scrap. he does not cause players to lose scrap when he encounters them during this final mission.items each item has a scrap cost, which is how many scrap tokens must be discarded for a crew member to craft it. items with a use limit are discarded (placed back with the other items) after that many uses, and may be crafted again. scrap tokens used by crew members to craft items and to fulfill some objectives. keep scrap next to your placard when you acquire it. coolant canisters crew members may only carry 1 coolant canister at a time. when you pick one up, place it on the designated space on your placard. coolant canisters may be discarded and converted into 2 scrap tokens at the workshop as an action. flashlight scrap cost: 2 use limit: unlimited whenever you lose morale, reduce the amount lost by 1. this item may be used when it's not your turn (does not stack with other flashlights). no action required. motion tracker scrap cost: 2 use limit: unlimited reveal a concealed token in a room up to 2 spaces away. if it's the alien, place the alien figure in the room, and you gain an action. shuffle the revealed token back into the concealed token stack. grapple gun scrap cost: 3 use limit: 2 if the alien is within 3 spaces of you, move the alien up to 3 spaces in any direction. incinerator scrap cost: 4 use limit: 2 if the alien is within 3 spaces of you, send it to the nest. if you do, don't draw an encounter card this turn. electric prod scrap cost: 3 use limit: 2 reduce the amount of morale lost when encountering the alien by 2. no action required. this item may be used when it's not your turn. cat carrier scrap cost: 1 if you reveal jonesy, capture jonesy underneath the cat carrier in your inventory. no action required.director’s cut rules setup ash is always used for this version of the game. place 1 coolant canister token in the following rooms: garage, equipment storage, maintenance bay, workshop, and suit storage. there will be one left over. discard it from play. place 2 scrap tokens in the garage, equipment storage and workshop. place the rest in a pile near the board. adjust the number of items tokens to the following: 5 coolant canisters, 2 flashlight, 2 motion tracker, 1 cat carrier, 2 electric prod, 1 incinerator, 1 grapple gun (remove the rest from the game). when playing solo, choose one of the following: select a minimum of three characters to play or choose a minimum of 4 objectives to complete. alternate rules items can only be crafted in the following rooms: equipment storage and workshop. scrap must be placed in a slot on the player's inventory. you can have as many scrap tokens in that slot as you collect. players must be adjacent to the alien to use the incinerator and grapple gun. the player must be in the same space to use the electric prod or flashlight. the grapple gun can only be used to move the alien to a space on the same level of the map (no moving the alien down or up the ladder). the motion tracker and flashlight can work ‘between levels’ as the rulebook. if a character is in the med bay or the mess , spend 3 scrap tokens to move the morale track back down 1 space. it costs 1 action to do this and you may only do this action once a turn. if the alien is encountered by a group of characters, the morale marker must be moved up the appropriate amount for each character. if ash enters a space with a crew member in it, lose 1 morale per character on the space. if a character enters a space with ash already in it, they do not lose morale. ash does not remove scrap from a player's inventory. instead of the movement rules given, use the movement on the alien encounter cards to also move ash. using the coolant canister to attack ash during the you have my sympathies finale costs 1 action. if a player has crafted the cat carrier and they reveal a jonesy token, ignore its effect and discard it from the game. on subsequent turns, if a jonesy conceal token is revealed, count it as empty and discard it from the game. when all objectives have been resolved, the self-destruct tracker is used, regardless of which final mission has been revealed. place all 4 tokens on the board. when all players have taken a turn, remove 1 token from the tracker. if all 4 tokens have been removed, the nostromo self-destructs and all players lose."

on top. place the resulting encounter deck on the marked space on the board. return the remaining encounter cards to the box. flip the drawn tt tokens faceup and place them in ascending order from bottom to top onto the expedition track. return the remaining tt tokens to the box. shuffle the feat cards and place the deck on the marked space on the board. place the top card from the deck faceup to form an adjacent feat discard pile. shuffle the swag cards and deal 3 of them faceup onto the slots in the trading post. place the swag deck on the marked space on the board. place the 5 green basic dice in the middle of the board. place all the tokens and extra dice within easy reach of all players. place the achievement cards next to the board. each player, starting with the one who most recently faced arcane horrors on a dark river, chooses a character and takes that character’s character mat. if the captain character is in play, give them the map token. otherwise, the player who chose their character last gets the map. each player starts with 1 of each token type: focus, treasure, courage, and feat; 3 feat cards; and any additional starting resources as listed on their character mat. place a re-roll track token on the re-roll track of each character mat. place all the players’ character pawns onto the riverboat and return any remaining pawns to the box. each player takes a copy of the scenario card. players collectively decide whether to play using the easy or difficult game environments, and all turn their card to the chosen side. tokens are collected on your play mat in 5 piles: one for tt tokens and one for each resource type. you may use 5x tokens to represent 5 resource tokens. an action must be completed in its entirety before another action may be played.sequence of play at the start of the round, return all character pawns to the riverboat. then the player with the map token may choose to give it to any player. then, the player with the map takes the first turn. play continues clockwise until each player has taken one turn, then the round ends. each player completes their entire turn before the next player begins theirs. 1. riverboat phase skip this phase if there are encounters at any of the locations. deal cards faceup from the encounter deck into the numbered slots on each location, from the lowest numbered slot to the highest numbered slot. take resource tokens from the supply matching the encounter type(s) shown on each newly-placed encounter card, and place those tokens on the corresponding location. 2. explore phase move your pawn to an active location (one with an encounter card). take any resource token(s) on that location, and add them to your stash. you may take the special location action shown on the location. 3. desperation phase you may spend courage tokens equal to the ancient secrets value of the encounter card at your current location to perform a desperate act. doing so means you immediately overcome the encounter and place it in your score stack. 4. encounter phase roll dice and spend dice combinations in an attempt to overcome an encounter at your location and gain resources. if you overcome the encounter, add the card to your score stack. if you do not overcome it, you will unleash a terrible thing in the next phase. if you have already overcome the encounter by performing a desperate act in the previous phase, roll the dice solely to gain resources. rolling the dice take the 5 green basic dice to form a dice pool. you may then play any swag or feat cards that allow you to add or swap out basic dice from your dice pool for other kinds of dice (such as luck, feat and panic dice.) roll your final dice pool. you may then choose to re-roll your dice up to 2 times. should you choose to do so, decide whether to make a focused or unfocused re-roll. to make a focused re-roll, select the dice you wish to re-roll, and spend focus tokens equal to that number of dice. then, re-roll the selected dice. yellow luck dice do not cost focus tokens to re-roll, and red panic dice may never be re-rolled. before or after each re-roll, you may perform the following actions in any order and any number of times: perform a feat. play a feat card from your hand, paying the feat tokens prompted on the card to the supply. these cards immediately take effect and are then discarded. if you cannot take the action on the feat card, it has no effect. use equipment. exhaust (turn facedown) one of your swag cards to use its effect, paying its token cost if prompted. this action applies only to swag cards that specify they are exhausted when used.you may not play feat or swag cards that allow you to swap out dice in your dice pool after your initial roll. you may however play cards that allow you to add dice to your pool. spending the dice once you are finished rolling, you may spend your combinations of dice to gain resources as per your scenario card, and/or overcome the encounter card. once you perform either of these actions, you may not reroll any of your dice. you may perform the following actions until you choose not to, or until you can no longer make any useable combinations with your remaining dice or choose not to: overcome the encounter. select dice that match the combination shown on the encounter card. remove those dice from the board, and add the encounter card to your score stack. gain resources. select dice that match a combination shown on your scenario card. remove those dice from the board, and gain the resources specified for that dice combination. re-roll track to keep track of how many re-rolls you have remaining, each character mat has a re-roll track and a re-roll tracker token. each player has a maximum of 2 re-rolls. move the re-roll track token on the re-roll track down 1 space, before each re-roll. cards that allow you roll additional dice do not count towards your re-rolls. during the refresh phase, reset your re-roll marker on your character mat’s re-roll track to 2. some cards may allow you to have an additional re-roll during your turn. 5. terrible thing phase if you fail to overcome the encounter (or choose not to), you unleash a terrible thing. discard the encounter card to the rumours space on the board, and take a terrible thing token from the lowest available space on the expedition track. if this is the last token on the track, the game ends immediately. 6. trading post phase move your pawn to the trading post. you may move any card in the trading post onto the old stock (discard) pile, and replace it with a new card from the top of the swag deck. then, you may buy any of the faceup swag cards (including the top card of the old stock pile), by paying the cost shown with treasure tokens from your stash. you may spend 2 treasure tokens to refresh up to 3 cards, placing them onto the old stock pile, and drawing new cards to replace them. when you have finished buying cards, refresh any empty slots by dealing new cards into them. 7 . refresh phase draw feat cards from the feat deck until you have 3 cards in your hand. turn all of your facedown (exhausted) swag cards faceup.your turn is now over. if all pawns are on the trading post, the round ends. if the encounter deck is empty at the end of the round, the game ends immediately. the unspeakable event the unspeakable event, and the end of the game, is triggered when one of the following conditions is met:the last tt token is removed from the expedition track during the terrible thing phase. there are no more encounter cards in the encounter deck to place at the start of a riverboat phase, and there are no active locations (locations with an encounter card). each player counts the total value of all ancient secrets in their score pile, which includes: overcome encounter cards swag cards that are worth ancient secrets achievement cards the map (worth 1 ancient secret) each player then subtracts the total penalty value of the tt tokens in their stash to arrive at a final score. the winner of the game is the player with the highest score. if any number of players tie for the highest score, break the tie by comparing tt tokens (the fewer tokens the better) and courage tokens (the more tokens the better) in that order. the player who wins the game becomes the lone survivor and briefly receives the battered journal token as their reward, before it is loathsomely committed to the sanatorium furnace. location actions there are 6 fateful locations shown on the board. each of these locations is associated with a unique action when you place your pawn on that location: accursed shrine you may gain 1 focus or feat token, adding it to your stash. ghastly gorge you may discard any number of feat cards from your hand, and draw that many fresh feat cards. sinister chateau you may exchange a resource token of any type from your stash with a resource token of a different type in another player’s stash. you may not move tt tokens this way. yawning chasm you may perform a desperate act against any encounter card in play. spend courage tokens to immediately overcome an encounter in any other location and place that card in your score pile, returning any resource tokens on that location to the supply. the number of courage tokens paid to activate this location action is equal to the value in ancient secrets shown on the encounter you overcome using this location action. you may still perform a desperate act at your current location during the desperation phase. rusted gunsloop you may gain a courage or treasure token, adding it to your stash. crumbling ruin take the map token. achievement cards achievement cards reward ancient secrets for achieving a particular game condition, and are available to any player. each achievement card is held by a single player, but players can steal an achievement card from another player by outperforming them. the conditions for claiming and stealing a particular achievement are described on the card.some swag cards count as a particular encounter type for the purposes of scoring achievements. dice combinations encounter and scenario cards show particular combinations of dice, which come in 4 types: high numbers (single die showing a particular number or higher). pairs of dice showing the same number, (which must be a particular value or higher). blocks of 3 or more dice showing the same number (which must be a particular value or higher). runs of 3 or more dice in a sequence (starting with a particular value or higher). cards show the minimum value of dice required for a combination. you must fulfill combinations one at a time, removing from the board any dice used to fulfill that combination. values shown on dice cannot be combined or split. runs and blocks can be made of 3, 4, 5, or more dice. when you fulfill a dice combination listed on a scenario card, you get 1 resource of the type shown for every die in the combination. the lost charter expansion character obsessions optionally, each character begins the game with their respective obsession. each obsession card describes the condition that activates the effect, and the condition to discard the obsession. obsessions have a terrible thing value if they remain in a player’s possession at game end. revelation encounter when a character attempts a revelation encounter, that player add a purple revelation die to their dice pool. revelation dice results may only be used for completing encounter dice combos and may not be used to gain resource tokens. the revelation die may be re-rolled using focus tokens. warning encounter these are exactly like ordinary encounters except they don’t cost you a tt token penalty if you fail them (so, they are worth fewer points for the same combo). however, should you fail a warning encounter, a tt token is still discarded from the expedition track. event encounter when drawn, encounter event cards are placed over the current location, and replace the location action at that location. some location events have an ongoing effect, that affects the entire game state. when a player moves their pawn to a location with an event encounter, the effect is resolved during the explore phase, and the event encounter is removed from the board. trade offer where a card allows a player to make a trade offer, that player may make a single offer to exchange secrets (ie. completed encounters), tokens or swag items in any combination or amount, with an opponent. achievement and feat cards cannot be traded. swag which are exhausted when activated, become exhausted when traded. a trade offer is not a negotiation, and cannot be revised or retracted once it has been made. foreshadowed encounters certain effects allow an encounter to be foreshadowed for a particular player, before their turn. this commits the player to attempting the encounter, unless an opponent does so before them.to foreshadow an encounter, place your pawn on it. if an opponent moves to an encounter you have foreshadowed, return your pawn to the riverboat and give that opponent a random tt token from your stash. the encounter then ceases to be foreshadowed. players on foreshadowed encounters take the location action and collect resources as per normal when beginning their turn. one way for an encounter to become foreshadowed is as a result of a player stepping in to rescue another player. this is a special effect which prevents the rescued player from taking a tt token, and foreshadows the encounter for the rescuer. any resources taken from the encounter card by the rescued player are returned to it if possible. forgotten secrets (solo play) setup remove all purple-header cards from the feat deck (player vs player feats). remove the skeleton key from the swag deck. do not use the character obsession cards. build an ominous encounter deck with 18 encounter cards (4 green, 6 orange, 8 red) shuffle and draw 5 tt tokens for the expedition track. choose a character and equip them with 1 resource token of each type, plus their starting resources. object of the game the object of the solo game is to end each round (including the final round) with an empty rumours pile and a positive ancient secrets score, with at least one terrible thing remaining on the expedition track. the solo game allows the player to forget ancient secrets from their score pile (removing them from the game), and to forget encounters in the rumours pile (removing them from the game). at the end of each round, the player must forget cards with at least double the total ancient secret value of the cards in the rumours pile. the entire rumours pile is then removed from the game. end of round is when no location has an encounter card (not at the end of each of the player’s turns). any cards worth ancient secrets can be spent in this way, including swag cards and achievements. note that achievements cannot be regained after they have been spent, and spent cards do not count towards achievements. cards which would normally be worth ancient secrets at the end of the game are worth that many ancient secrets when they are forgotten. the map the map is not used to determine turn order. instead, when the player has the map, they may discard it when they fail to overcome an encounter. that encounter stays on the board, is replenished with resource tokens, and the player does not take a tt counter. the player may regain the map through any effects which would normally cause them to gain the map (including the location action of the crumbling ruin). the map token cannot be used at the crumbling ruin. location action variants the location action variants for solo play are on the reverse side of the respective travel edition cards. these cards cover the original locations when using the board during solo play: sinister chateau: take a token from the bank, return a token to the bank. yawning chasm: spend courage tokens equal to the ancient secrets value of the top card on the rumours discard pile, to discard that card from play."

ice are installed horizontally. an upgrade is installed in a remote server in the same place as an agenda or asset (the runner should not be able to guess the type of card by its position).corporation play area central servers you have 3 central servers;

the runner cannot. root the area of a central server where upgrades for the server are installed. an upgrade installed in the root is placed below the server. if a root has no cards installed in it, it is considered empty. remote servers you have no remote servers at the start of the game. you create them by installing cards. cards in remote servers are active if rezzed and inactive if unrezzed. there is no limit to the number of remote servers you can have at a time.ice the corporation installs ice to protect his servers. installed ice is always placed in front of a particular server and dedicated to it. ice can protect an empty server. ice is active if rezzed and inactive if unrezzed. runner play area grip your hand of cards. you begin the game with a maximum hand size of 5 cards. cards in the grip are inactive. stack your draw deck, kept facedown. cards in the stack are inactive. heap your discard pile, where your cards are placed when trashed or discarded. cards in the heap are faceup and inactive. both the runner and corporation may look through the heap at any time, but must maintain the order of its cards. rig where you install your cards. the rig is separated into 3 rows: programs, hardware, and resources. cards in the rig are active. identity cardstack (draw)heap (discard)programs resourceshardware score areaclick tracker sample play area - runnerrig sample play area - corporationremote serveridentity card root root root hq r&d central serversarchivesr&d (draw)archives (discard) score areaclick trackerremote serverice ice iceice ice iceiceturn sequence the corporation and the runner alternate taking turns. a player takes actions in his turn by spending clicks . you can only spend your clicks during your own action phase, and you must spend all of them. the corporation begins his turn with 3 , the runner, 4 . you can perform your actions any number of times, in any combination, if you can pay for them. when you spend clicks on an action, you cannot take another until the current action fully resolves. corporation turn 1: draw phase draw 1 r&d card (this does not cost any clicks). if r&d is empty, the runner immediately wins the game. 2: action phase take actions by spending . 3. discard phase if the cards in hq (your hand) exceed your current maximum hand size, discard down, one at a time, to your maximum hand size. discarded hq cards are always sent to archives facedown. runner’s turn 1: action phase take actions by spending . 2. discard phase if the cards in your grip (your hand) exceed your current maximum hand size, discard down, one at a time, to your maximum hand size. corporation actions draw 1 card spend to draw the top card of r&d;

you may instead advance it more, or wait to score it. trash a runner’s resource if the runner is tagged, spend , 2 to trash one of his resources. purge virus counters spend to remove all virus counters hosted, returning them to the token bank. trigger abilities cards with the icon in their trigger cost can be triggered only during your action phase. runner’s actions draw 1 card spend to draw the top card from your stack; add it to your grip. gain 1 credit spend to take 1 from the bank; add it to your credit pool. install cards spend to install a single program, resource, or piece of hardware faceup and vertically in your program row. an installed runner card is active and does not have to be rezzed. you cannot have programs installed that have a combined memory cost greater than your available memory units (mu) . you begin the game with 4 mu. if you ever exceed your available mu, you must trash your installed programs until you are no longer exceeding your available mu. you can trash any number of your installed programs at the beginning of an install program action. there is no limit to the number of resources and hardware you can have installed (however you can only have one piece of hardware with the console subtype installed at a time). play events spend to play an event from your hand. pay its play cost, place it faceup in your play area, immediately resolve its effects, then trash it. remove tags spend , 2 to remove 1 tag. make a run spend to initiate a run to steal the corporation’s agendas and trash his cards. trigger abilities cards with the icon in their trigger cost can be triggered only during your action phase.runs in a run, the runner attacks one of the corporation’s servers in an attempt to access cards, using his installed programs to help him pass the corporation’s ice. ice there are mainly 4 subtypes that can appear on a piece of ice: sentry, barrier, code gate, and trap. subroutines are the abilities of a piece of ice. if the runner encounters a piece of rezzed ice and does not or cannot break its subroutines, the unbroken subroutines trigger and resolve one by one. icebreakers icebreakers (programs with the icebreaker subtype) can be used by the runner to interact with and break subroutines on ice encountered during a run. they have a strength, install cost, and one or more subtypes reflecting which kind of ice subroutine they break. an icebreaker can only interact with ice with an equal or lower strength, and some can only break subroutines on specified subtypes of ice. an ability not restricted to a subtype can be used against any piece of ice. an icebreaker may allow the runner to temporarily modify its strength by spending credits. these modifiers only last while the current piece of ice is being encountered, unless otherwise noted. phases of a run 1. initiation phase declare the server you are attacking. you can only initiate a run against a single server per run action. gain 1 to spend during the run for each point of bad publicity the corporation has. if there is ice protecting the server, go to the confrontation phase. if there is no ice protecting the server, go to the access phase. 2. confrontation phase approach each piece of ice one at a time, starting with the outermost piece. you must pass each piece of ice to approach the next, continuing until all have been passed or until the run ends. when approaching ice, first decide whether you wish to continue the run or jack out. if you jack out, the run is ended unsuccessfully. you cannot jack out while approaching the first piece of ice. if you continue, the corporation may rez the approached ice and any other non-ice cards. the corporation can only rez ice when it is approached. if the approached piece of ice is rezzed, you encounter it. if it is not rezzed, you pass it and continue the run. you may try to break any subroutines on an encountered piece of ice (in any order); then each unbroken subroutine triggers in the order listed. a subroutine that ends the run ends it immediately; no further subroutines on that piece of ice trigger.to break a subroutine, use abilities on your installed icebreakers. you may use any number of installed cards to interact with the encountered ice. a passed piece of ice remains installed and is approached during every subsequent run against the server it protects. after you break all of the ice’s subroutines and/or any effects from unbroken subroutines resolve without ending the run, you have passed that piece of ice and continue the run. if you pass all pieces of ice protecting the attacked server, proceed to the access phase. 3. access phase you have one final opportunity to jack out. if you continue, the corporation has one final opportunity to rez cards. after rezzing cards, the run is successful. access the corporation’s cards according to the type of server: r&d: access the top card of r&d, and any upgrades in its root. unless you score, trash, or are forced by a card’s text to reveal the card, you do not show cards accessed from r&d to the corporation. hq: access 1 random card from hq and any upgrades in its root (show the card to the corporation). any cards you do not score or trash return to hq. archives: turn all cards in archives and any upgrades in its root faceup, then access them individually in any order. steal all agendas in archives; you cannot trash cards already in archives. then all cards in archives return to archives faceup. remote server: access all cards in the server. installed ice is not in a server and is never accessed. you steal an agenda if you access it, placing it faceup in your score area and resolving any conditional abilities (“when you steal”). an agenda in your score area adds its agenda points to your score. you cannot decline to steal agendas you access. if you access a card with a trash cost , you may pay credits equal to the cost to trash it to archives faceup. when accessing multiple cards, access them one at a time in any order. when accessing multiple cards from r&d, you must draw them in order from the top of the deck, and return any cards not scored or trashed in reverse order. you must fully resolve your access to a card before accessing the next card. after you have accessed all required cards, return any cards not stolen or trashed to their original play states. the run then ends. return any unspent bad publicity credits to the token bank and resume your action phase. traces and tags traces traces are marked by tracex on a card, with x equaling the base trace strength of the trace. the corporation first openly spends any number of credits to increase his trace strength by 1 point for each credit. the runner’s base link strength is equal to the number of links he has in play. he may then openly spend any number of credits to increase his link strength by 1 point for each credit. if the trace strength exceeds the link strength, the trace is successful. resolve any associated “if successful” effects. if the link strength is equal to or greater than the trace strength, the trace is unsuccessful. resolve any associated “if unsuccessful” effects. tags a runner is tagged as long as he has at least 1 tag. while tagged, the corporation may, as an action, spend and 2 to trash one of the runner’s resources. while tagged, the runner may, as an action, spend and 2 to remove the tag. he can repeat this action as many times as desired. damage the runner can receive 3 types of damage: meat damage and net damage: randomly trash 1 card from your grip for each point of meat or net damage. brain damage: randomly trash 1 card from your grip for each point of brain damage, and your maximum hand size is permanently reduced by 1 card. take a brain damage token to track this. when you trash multiple cards for damage, place them in your heap in the order they were randomly trashed. winning the game if at any time a player has 7 agenda points in his score area, he immediately wins the game. if r&d contains no cards and the corporation attempts to draw a card, the runner immediately wins the game. if the runner takes more damage than the number of cards in his grip, or if he has a maximum hand size of less than 0 at the end of his turn, he is flatlined and the corporation wins. other notes recurring credits are placed on a card when the card becomes active and can be used immediately as instructed. they are only placed up to the number listed on the card at the beginning of the player’s turn, before any conditional abilities can be triggered. trash is a self-referential trigger cost on a card. unique cards there can be only one unique card ( ) of the same title active at a time. if a card with a unique title becomes active, any other card that shares its title is immediately trashed; this cannot be prevented. card abilities only apply to themselves unless otherwise stated and can be used multiple times unless otherwise stated."

jimmy the snitch markers at the locations listed for week one. place the day marker on the first day of the first week of the calendar. starting from the top of the murder sheet, count out a number of suspects equal to one more than the number of players and place their suspect sheets next to the murder sheet. each player selects or randomly draws a detective and takes his detective sheet, tip sheet, figure, twilight cards (separated into light and dark), plot cards, special cards, hero markers, vehicle ruler, warrant markers and one twilight marker. players place their detective figures at their starting locations and their twilight marker on the center space of the twilight track on their detective sheet. place the testimony lead markers corresponding to the suspects at the locations listed on the murder sheet. each player takes the physical and document lead markers listed on his detective sheet and places them on their color- matched locations. shuffle the evidence markers into a facedown pile. place the following tokens on or near these locations: corp favors melange mining (g7) political favors city hall (a2) society favors levy university (e1) street favors eastside tenements (l3) alibis order of sol (f8) hits humanity labor (h1) trauma starlight crusade (d1) dropship passes napd (i3) baggage castle club (f4) randomly stack the puzzle pieces facedown by type. place the 3 stacks near the conspiracy part of the board with shift pieces on the left (the least valuable), favor pieces in the middle, and baggage pieces on the right (the most valuable). remove any hunch cards for suspects not in the game, shuffle the remainder into innocent (blue) and guilty (red) decks, and deal one of each facedown to each player. each player takes the start cards for each of his 3 plots, shuffles them, and selects one randomly as his plot for week one (raymond only has 2 plots, and caprice should not include the start card for her descent into madness plot when selecting randomly). each player shuffles his light and dark twilight decks separately, places his dark deck on the space on the map and his light deck next to his detective sheet, and draws 2 cards from his light deck and one from the dark deck of the player on his left. shuffle the general event deck and place it on its board space. select the 3 murder-specific event cards for the murder, randomly choose one and place it facedown on its space. return all other murder-specific cards to the box. choose a first player, who places one of his hero markers at the scene of the crime marker and takes

dropship pass token. wrapped up in himself card in play. shuffle 4 memory cards and deal one to each other player, returning any extra to the box unseen. game round during each round (day), each player takes a turn spending a certain amount of time, then any end of day events occur. the player whose turn it is takes the time sheet and marker, places the time marker on the 6 mark of the time sheet, then spends his time performing actions until it is all gone or he no longer wishes to continue. a player may perform a given action several times unless otherwise noted. actions that cost 1 time: move to a new location the distance moved is limited by the detective’s vehicle ruler. draw a free light twilight card if he enters a ritzy location, or a free dark twilight card if he enters a seedy location. follow up a lead if in the same location as a testimony, physical, or document lead, the player may follow up that lead by either placing a piece of evidence on a suspect or uncovering a piece of the conspiracy. draw or discard a twilight card a player with fewer than 6 twilight cards (or fewer than 7, in raymond’s case) may draw either one light card from his light deck or one dark card from any other player’s dark deck. alternatively, a player may discard a light or dark card to the bottom of its deck without playing it. if a player draws the last facedown card in a deck, shuffle the discarded cards to create a new facedown deck. raymond’s memory cards do not count against the hand limit, nor can they be discarded or looked at by effects that target a player’s hand. play a light card a player may play a light card from his hand, but must still pay the usual twilight cost. dark cards do not cost time to play, since they are played during another player’s turn. get a jump on the case if a player is in the same location as the scene of the crime marker, he may remove the hero marker there and replace it with one of his own. if it is still in place at the end of the phase, he becomes the new first player. actions costing variable time: use a location ability if a player is in a major location, he may use that location’s ability, also spending additional costs if required. a player may only use a given location’s ability once per round. event-based actions some event cards grant temporary abilities to certain places on the map, though often these are only available to the first player to use, after which they expire.end of day phase advance the day marker by one day, then any end of day events (general event and plot resolution) shown on the previous day are carried out. the final 2 days of the game are the climax. the detective whose hero marker was last placed on the scene of the crime becomes the new first player and takes the first player marker. movement a player moves his detective by spending 1 time and moving his detective to any new location anywhere within reach of his vehicle ruler. pause after each movement between locations, to give other players a chance to react to the move with cards or other effects. there are five types of locations: religious (yellow), civic (green), residential (red), business (blue), and nightlife (purple). leads must be moved to a new location of the same type. if a detective enters a restricted location that he does not have a warrant on, he must spend 3 time instead of 1. a location’s quality is indicated by the shape of its symbol: ritzy ( ), normal ( ), and seedy ( ). when a detective enters a ritzy location, that player may draw one light card from his light deck for free (if his hand isn’t full). a detective entering a seedy location may draw one dark card from any other player’s dark deck for free (if his hand isn’t full). these draws are allowed once each time a detective enters a seedy or ritzy location. detectives cannot move between the earth and the moon except by using the beanstalk or by using of a dropship pass.the beanstalk is a district consisting of 5 locations between the earth (the root) and the moon (starport kaguya). once he has entered the beanstalk at either end, a detective may move along it by paying 1 time to travel to each of its successive locations. a detective may reverse direction, but may only leave the beanstalk from one of its ends. a player with a dropship pass may spend it (return to the pile at the napd) to move to any location in either city, anywhere on the map or the beanstalk. this still requires spending 1 time to move, and is otherwise considered a normal move. following up leads a detective who spends 1 time while in a location with a testimony lead, physical lead, or document lead, may follow up that lead. the player on your right must move the lead token to a new location of his choice without a lead marker already on it, of the same type (color) as its previous location, and in a different district from the one his own detective is in (unless there are no other legal locations where it can be placed). when a lead is followed up during the climax, it is not moved, but returned to the box and out of the game. after following up a lead, the player whose turn it is decides whether to use the lead to place evidence on a suspect, or uncover a piece of the conspiracy. placing evidence the player may draw an evidence token, look at in secret, and place it (normally facedown) on a live suspect of his choice in the suspect’s file area that corresponds to the type of lead. a player may choose to reveal an evidence token by placing it faceup (which is usually a bad idea but can be useful in bluffs, deals, and other strategies). once revealed, it stays revealed unless a card or other game effect says otherwise. there are also 2 types of special evidence that a detective may uncover: surprise witnesses and perjuries. a surprise witness serves as a –5 (very innocent) piece of evidence. for each perjury token, one alibi or surprise witness on that suspect has its value changed from –5 to +5. uncovering the conspiracy the player may choose one of these 2 options: 1. reveal information: draw the top puzzle piece from the pile beside his hero marker, then move the marker so that it is next to the least valuable pile with puzzle pieces in it. if the draw exhausted a pile, any other hero markers that were next to that pile are moved to the next-most valuable pile (or the next-least valuable pile, if no more-valuable piles remain). if all piles have been exhausted, all the hero markers are returned to the box. after adjusting the hero markers, the player immediately gains a benefit based on which type of puzzle piece he drew: shift: the player may light shift or dark shift any one player, including himself. favor: the player gains one normal favor of his choice. baggage: the player may place one piece of good or bad baggage on any player’s plot, including his own. then the either player discard the piece (by choice, or if it cannot be legally placed), or add the piece to the conspiracy puzzle, in the attempt to create links between groups and the conspiracy. a new piece must be attached to an already placed piece, growing outward from the conspiracy at the center. a new piece must extend at least one linkage line from at least one already-placed puzzle piece. it may dead-end one or more lines, as long as at least one line is extended. after placing or discarding a piece, the player immediately gains any bonuses shown on it: move a lead: the player may select one lead of the type shown and move it as though it had just been followed up by the player to his left. place a hit: the player may place a hit on one suspect of his choice. place a bonus puzzle piece: the player may draw one piece of the type shown and add it to the puzzle. he receives the basic benefits and bonuses from that piece as normal. jinteki link or haas link: these 2 pieces may be used to create links, or not, from the conspiracy to haas-bioroid and jinteki. when closing the case, haas tokens are worth +1 vp for every link made between haas-bioroid and the conspiracy, while jinteki tokens are worth +1 vp for every link made between jinteki and the conspiracy. if a player adds the last puzzle piece to a row, a column, or one of the diagonals passing through the center, he gains one conspiracy token (worth 4 vp each at the end of the game) for each row, column, or diagonal completed. a link is a continuous line connecting one of the groups around the outside of the puzzle (or haas or jinteki, if their special pieces come up) to the conspiracy at the center. separate connections to each of the 4 sides of the conspiracy are considered different links, so there can be up to 4 links between the conspiracy and a given group. additional lines from a group to the same side of the conspiracy are not considered to be additional links. some vp values are adjusted at the end of the game as a result of links. 2. dig deeper: the player advances his hero marker so it is next to the next-most valuable pile of puzzle pieces.playing twilight cards with a few exceptions, a detective’s twilight cards are only played during his turn. a player may pay 1 time in order to play a light card from his hand, paying the card’s twilight cost and meeting any conditions or costs listed on the card. he then performs the actions on the card and then discards it faceup to the bottom of his light deck. other players may also play a given detective’s dark cards during that player’s turn, in response to his actions. it costs a player 0 time to play a dark card, but the card’s twilight cost and any conditions listed on the card must still be met. the player performs the actions listed on the card and then discards it faceup to the bottom of the dark deck from which it was drawn. twilight costs a detective’s twilight level is tracked on his detective sheet using a twilight marker (which moves one space at a time unless otherwise stated). if the marker is all the way to the left side, the detective is said to be completely light shifted. if all the way to the right side, completely dark shifted. moving leftward along the track is called light shifting, while moving rightward along the track is called dark shifting. when a player wishes to play one of his light cards, he must dark shift by the number of spaces shown in the card’s upper left corner. similarly, when he wants to play another detective’s dark card, he must light shift by the number of spaces shown in the card’s upper left corner. ideally, a player should play at least one light card and one dark card each round. if a player wants to play a card for which he cannot afford the twilight cost, or if he wants to get rid of excess cards, he may discard twilight cards (of any type) in order to reduce the card’s twilight cost. for every discarded card, the played card’s cost is reduced by one (0 minimum). players may not discard cards to reduce the cost of a card being played by another player. when a light or dark card whose color matches the target detective’s current plot is played, the player playing the card may either increase or decrease its twilight cost by one. cards only one dark card and one light card may be played in response to a single event. if multiple players wish to play cards, first determine who plays a dark card; the first player has priority, followed by players clockwise. after the dark card has been resolved, the active player may then play his light card. light and dark cards drawn at no cost upon entering ritzy or seedy locations are drawn before any cards can be played in response to the detective entering that location. traits bolded, italicized words on cards are traits, used to categorize cards into groups that may be affected by other cards. when a fight trait card is played on a player (by himself or by another player), that player must respond by choosing either light tactics (fighting like a good guy, shooting to injure instead of kill, etc) or dark tactics (doing whatever is necessary to win the fight, honorable or not). if the player chooses light tactics, he light shifts (if able) and does whatever is listed on the light tactics portion of the card. if the player chooses dark tactics, he dark shifts (if able) and does whatever is listed on the dark tactics portion. a detective who is completely light shifted can still choose light tactics, and a detective who is completely dark shifted can still choose dark tactics.plots plots are problems that spring up in the detective’s personal life while he’s investigating the murder. each detective must deal with one plot each week (except raymond, whose plots take 2 weeks to resolve). each plot is comprised of a single-sided start card, a double- sided crossroads card, and 2 double-sided ending cards (with vp on them). at the start of each week, a random plot is selected for each detective, and its start card is put into play. emotional baggage plots accumulate emotional baggage over the course of the week, which determines how they resolve. each start and/or crossroads card has a good baggage section (orange) and a bad baggage (grey) section. when a plot gains good baggage, a baggage token is placed on it, orange side up. when a plot gains bad baggage, a baggage token is placed on it, grey side up. baggage accumulates on each player’s start card until the end of the 3rd day of the week, when the start card is resolved and one of the 2 sides of the crossroads card corresponding to that plot enters play. the start card indicates which side of the crossroads card comes into play based on how it was resolved. baggage then accumulates anew on the crossroads card until the end of the 6th day of the week, when the crossroads card, and the entire plot, is resolved with the ending for the plot. the ending card is then put into play with the appropriate side faceup, and then, if appropriate, a new plot is chosen at random for the next week. resolving plots at the end of the 3rd and 6th days of each week, starting with the first player and continuing clockwise, each player resolves his plot in turn. if a player’s plot has more good baggage than bad baggage, it resolves positively. he looks finds the plot card named in the good baggage section of the card and puts it into play, then discards the old card, along with all of the baggage on it. if a player’s plot has as much or more bad baggage than good baggage (or none at all), it resolves negatively. he finds the plot card named in the bad baggage section of his card and puts it into play, then discards the old card, along with all of the baggage on it. special rules listed on a start card or a crossroads card only remain in effect as long as that card is in play. once a plot has ended, its ending card remains in play for the rest of the game, so any mechanics listed on ending cards also last for the rest of the game. twilight cards and conditional baggage twilight cards can give a player baggage. duty (always italicized and normally named after a positive or negative personality characteristic) is an example of conditional baggage. a player who gains conditional baggage must look at his current plot card (his current start or crossroads card, not any previous ending card). if the conditional baggage is listed in the good baggage section of the card, he gains good baggage equal to the amount of conditional baggage he gained. if the conditional baggage is listed in the bad baggage section of the card, he gains bad baggage equal to the amount of conditional baggage he gained. if the conditional baggage is listed in neither section, he gains neither good nor bad baggage.events at the end of the 2nd, 4th, and 5th day of each week, a general event is drawn from the general event deck and resolved. at the start of the 1st day of the 2nd week, the specific event chosen at the start is revealed and resolved. a general event is placed in the first general event space, moving any event there to the 2nd space (and knocking any event there off the track). move an npc’s status marker onto the map to show his location if necessary. an event’s effect can end if the npc associated with it is eliminated or redirected to a new event; the event effect ends as described on the card; or the event falls off the track. turn the event facedown in its space and do not resolve it. any npcs associated with an event whose effect has ended are removed from the map and returned to their owners. a specific event often involves suspects. move the testimony leads corresponding to all suspects in play to the locations listed. if any of the locations already contain a lead, the 2 leads in question switch locations. other event effects are then resolved. if a suspect has been killed, or is killed during the event, the event immediately ends; return it to the box. some specific events move a suspect to a specific location and then require players to pay time to move him to another. the testimony lead corresponding to that suspect cannot be followed up until the event has ended. other tokens favors are gained at various locations. they do not have any abilities on their own, but are normally spent to pay all or part of the cost to use a location ability or play a card. players are limited to the quantity of favor tokens included with the game. due to links, some favors are worth vp at game end. haas tokens are gained through the use of haas-bioroid’s location ability. jinteki tokens are gained through the use of jinteki’s location ability. both represent leverage that can be used against the company, and are worth 3 vp each at the end of the game. players are limited to the tokens included with the game. warrants allow the detective that placed the warrant to enter a specific restricted area without losing 2 time. once placed on a location, a warrant remains there for the rest of the game. a player may only have 2 warrants in play at a time, but may move one of his warrants instead of placing one. alibi tokens are normally placed as a result of the order of sol’s location ability. choose an active suspect and places an alibi token on his sheet. surprise witnesses tokens act just like alibis except that they can be placed in secret. each alibi and surprise witness token is worth -5 guilt for that suspect when the case closes. perjury tokens are special evidence. when the case closes, for each perjury token on a suspect, one alibi or surprise witness on him is worth +5 guilt instead of –5 guilt. hits hit tokens are normally placed as a bonus when a player reveals information and places a puzzle piece, or when he uses the humanity labor location ability. choose an active suspect and place a hit token on his sheet. if a suspect ever has 3 hits on his sheet, he is immediately killed; return all of the evidence, hit, and alibi tokens on his sheet to their respective piles, and then turn the sheet facedown. hit tokens may not be removed from a dead suspect. at the end of the game, neither guilty nor innocent hunches indicating dead suspects pay off.npcs if an npc is eliminated, turn that npc’s status marker facedown to the skull side. the detective associated him must discard any npc favors he possesses from that npc, and cannot gain any more this game. certain npcs can grant favors to their associated detective. these can be spent just like any other favor, but as though they were one of 2 or more different types of normal favors, as shown on the token. each npc favor spent still only counts as one favor; it can just be one of several different types. lily lockwell, reporter when a detective enters lily’s location, he must spend 1 time if he has any left. the player may choose one piece of evidence on any suspect sheet and reveal it faceup. then the player moves lily to a location of the same type (color) in a different district. lily may be moved to a location containing a lead, but cannot be moved to jimmy the snitch’s location. jimmy the snitch when a detective enters jimmy’s location, he may spend 1 time to either look at any one other player’s cards, or peek at all of the facedown evidence on a single suspect sheet. the information may not be shared with the other players. then the player moves jimmy to another location of the same type (color) in a different district. jimmy may be moved to a location containing a lead, but cannot be moved to lily lockwell’s location. closing the case after the end of the 6th day of week 2, the game ends. players determine which suspect is the murderer, add up their vp, and the player with the highest total wins. if a tie, if only one of the tied players had a correct guilty hunch, he wins. otherwise, the players share the victory. for each suspect, do the following: 1. turn all of the facedown evidence tokens on his suspect sheet faceup. 2. find the lowest-value evidence token in his strong evidence file (even if positive), and discard all pieces of evidence of that numerical value from that file. 3. find the highest-value evidence in his weak evidence file (even if negative), and discard all pieces of evidence of that numerical value from that file. 4. add up all of the values of remaining evidence. 5. match each perjury token up with an alibi or surprise witness on the same suspect. any perjury token that cannot be matched up with an alibi or surprise witness is discarded. subtract 5 from the evidence total for each alibi or surprise witness on the suspect that is not matched up with a perjury token. add 5 for each alibi or surprise witness on the suspect that is matched up with a perjury token. it doesn’t matter what file the tokens are in. the suspect with the highest total (even if lower than 0) is the murderer. the player with that suspect’s guilty hunch is correct, and every player with any other suspect’s innocent hunch is correct. a player who has both guilty and innocent hunches for the same suspect is obsessed. his hunches pay off normally, but if the suspect has a total guilt at least 5 higher than every other suspect’s total, both of the detective’s hunches are considered to be correct, and he also receives +3 vp. some values may be modified by the links that have been made on the conspiracy puzzle. for each link made between the conspiracy and a group, one of the vp values scored at the end of the game is adjusted. consult the reference sheet for final scoring."
14,285967,ANKH: GODS OF EGYPT,2021,CMON,3.0714,308,"setup each player chooses a god and takes the components belonging to their god: god figure, 6 warrior figures, god dashboard, merged god dashboard, ankh tokens, set of 7 battle cards, and player aid card. if a player has ra, they take the 3 sun tokens. if a player has osiris, they take the 3 underworld tokens. if a player has amun, they take the amun token. each player starts with 1 follower token. all remaining follower tokens go into a general supply. followers are not limited; if you run out of them, use any replacement. each player places 6 of their ankh tokens on their god dashboard in the spaces along the bottom row. keep your remaining ankh tokens near you in a personal ankh token pool. randomly determine a first player (or assign it to the player who owns the most cats). other players will follow in clockwise order. in reverse player order, starting with the last player, each player places their plastic ankh token on the bottom space of the devotion track, forming a stack. the first player’s token should be on top starting with the most devotion, the rest under it in order. place the 4 action markers on the action tracks of the central dashboard in the starting spaces that match the number of players in the game. place the event marker on the first space of the events track. choose a scenario from the scenario book (agreed upon by all players or picked randomly). make sure the chosen scenario is possible with the number of players. place monuments (pyramids, temples, and obelisks), conflict order tokens, and camels (if any) on the board as shown in the scenario setup diagram. set the remaining monuments, conflict order tokens, battle tiebreaker token, and camels aside in the general supply. conflict order tokens don’t belong to a specific space on the board. they are assigned to an entire region. place your figures and ankh tokens (on your controlled monuments) on the board as shown in the scenario setup. the first player is player #1 in the instructions, the player to their left is player #2, and so on. choose (agreed upon by all players or picked randomly) one level 1, one level 2 and one level 3 guardian card and place them near the board. then, place a number of their guardian figures next to the cards according to the number of players: 2 players: use 1 guardian figure of each type. 3 players: use 2 guardian figures of each type. 4 or 5 players: use all available guardian figures of each type (3 for small-base guardians, 2 for large-base guardians). follow any additional setup rules in the scenario book. basics the map is divided into 3 regions. spaces are either fertile (green), desert (yellow) or water (blue). land spaces can be either empty or occupied by exactly 1 figure or monument. water spaces cannot normally be occupied; they count as part of each region they are adjacent to and are considered adjacent to all spaces surrounding them.figures and monuments are adjacent to each other if they occupy spaces that share a hex border and are both in the same region. spaces divided by a river or camel are not adjacent. camel caravans are not considered figures and are not controlled by any player. there are 3 types of monuments: obelisks, temples, and pyramids. a monument is controlled by a god if it has one of that god’s ankh tokens attached to it. each monument can only be controlled by 1 god at a time. a monument without any ankh token on it is a neutral monument. if multiple ankh tokens are stacked on the same space of the devotion track, the order of the stack indicates which god has more devotion than the others, with the token on top of the stack representing the most devotion and the one on the bottom representing the least devotion on that space. when a god’s ankh token enters a space occupied by other tokens, the new token always goes on the top of the stack. whenever multiple players gain or lose devotion at the same time, start with the player with the least devotion and proceed in ascending order to the player with the most devotion. game turn the game is played in turns. during your turn, you perform 1 or 2 actions. sometimes, your action will also trigger an event. after fully resolving the your action(s) and any event, yours turn ends and the next player in clockwise order takes their turn. actions there are 4 possible actions you can take during your turn: move figures summon figure gain followers unlock ankh power each action has its own track on the central dashboard. to choose an action, slide the corresponding action marker 1 space to the right on its track, then perform that action in its entirety. you are allowed to choose an action even if you cannot resolve it. if the chosen action marker reaches the rightmost space of its track (white background), an event is triggered. first, completely resolve the player action that triggered the event. then, advance the event marker 1 space to the right on the event track. resolve the event, then return the action marker to its starting position on its action track (the space that matches the number of players in the game at the start of the game; as a reminder, you can use the ankh tokens of an unused god to cover the leftmost spaces that can’t be used). if you trigger an event with your first action, you are not allowed to take a second action. after performing your first action, if you did not trigger an event, you must choose a second action. the second action must be in a lower line of the dashboard than the first. even if you cannot resolve your second action for some reason, you must still move its action marker. the only cases in which you move a single marker on your turn is if you trigger an event with your first action, if your first action is unlock ankh power, or if your god is merged. move figures this action allows you to move each of your figures on the board 1, 2, or 3 spaces. figures can move across spaces occupied by figures belonging to any player or by monuments or any other tokens, across water spaces, or cross rivers and camel caravans, but they must end their movement in an empty space that is not a water space. each space on the board can only be occupied by 1 figure or 1 monument at a time. summon figure this action allows you to choose 1 figure from your pool (warrior or guardian) and place it on the board. this figure must be placed in an empty, non-water space adjacent to one of your figures already on the board, or adjacent to a monument you control (remember that adjacency requires them to be in the same region). gain followers when performing this action, you gain a number of followers equal to the number of monuments (either under your control or neutral) you have any figures adjacent to. take that number of follower tokens from the general supply and add them to your pool. unlock ankh power ankh powers on your god dashboard can only be used after they have been unlocked by performing this action. they are divided into 3 levels and displayed in 3 columns: each god may have a maximum of 2 ankh powers unlocked in each level. your ankh tokens sit in a row at the bottom of the dashboard, with 2 ankh tokens in each column. each time you perform this action, move the leftmost ankh token in this bottom row up to the ankh power of your choice within the same column. therefore, two level 1 ankh powers must be unlocked before a level 2 power can be unlocked, and so on. each time an ankh power is unlocked, you must sacrifice a number of your followers equal to the level of the ankh power you are unlocking (1, 2, or 3). return sacrificed followers from your pool to the general supply. if you don’t have enough followers, or have already unlocked all of your ankh powers, you may still take this action, moving the action marker but gaining no benefit from it (without sacrificing any followers). if you reveal a guardian symbol on your dashboard, you gain control of 1 guardian figure from the guardian card of the same level. if there are no more figures available on that guardian card, you gain nothing. attach one of your color bases of the appropriate size to the new figure. if you don’t have a spare base of the appropriate size, you can’t take the figure. guardians in your pool can be summoned to the board with the summon figure action. events the event track is the game’s timeline. there are 2 types of event spaces: individual events (round spaces) that only involve the player that triggered the event, and conflicts (square spaces) that involve all players. control monument when you trigger this event, you gain control of 1 neutral monument of your choice, as long as you have at least 1 figure adjacent to that monument. place one of your ankh tokens from your pool on the monument to indicate your control. if there are no neutral monuments left on the board when this event is triggered, you gain control of a monument controlled by another player instead. you must still have at least 1 figure adjacent to the monument you wish to control. if you do, remove that other player’s ankh token from the monument (returning it to that player’s pool) and replace it with one of your own. if you are not adjacent to a valid monument, or if you don’t have any ankh tokens in your pool, you don’t gain any benefit from resolving this event (though the event tracker is still moved).camel cara van when you trigger this event, you can place a line of up to 6 camels, from the general supply, onto the board. camels are placed on the lines that separate the spaces, 1 camel per hexagon side (not on rivers or water spaces). you must place a line of camels connecting 2 of the following features on the game board: rivers, water spaces, other camels, or external map borders. both new regions created by this division must be at least 6 spaces in size (not counting water spaces). choose one of the new regions to keep the conflict order token from the original region. then take the conflict order token from the supply with the lowest number and place it in the new region without a token. finally, swap the conflict order token from one of the 2 new regions with any conflict order token already on the board. conflict if you triggered this event, take the battle tiebreaker token, keeping it faceup. after the event has been fully resolved, the battle tiebreaker token is returned to the general supply. when a conflict event is triggered, each region on the board is resolved in order, following the conflict order tokens from lowest number to highest. ignore regions with no figures. if a region has figures belonging to 2 or more players, a battle is fought. if all figures in a region belong to a single player, that player dominates the region. first, they gain 1 devotion for each monument majority they have (they must control more monuments of a specific type in the region than any opponents). second, they gain 1 devotion for dominating the region. battle perform these steps in order to resolve each battle: 1. select and reveal cards: each player with at least 1 figure in the region secretly chooses 1 of their battle cards from their hand and places it facedown in front of them. all chosen cards are revealed simultaneously. 2. build monument: resolve all revealed build monument battle cards in ascending order on the devotion track starting with the player with the least devotion. 3. resolve plague: resolve all revealed plague of locusts battle cards. 4. monument majority: determine which players have monument majorities for each type of monument (they must control more monuments of a specific type in the region than any opponents). then, award to each player (in reverse devotion order) 1 devotion per majority they have. 5. battle resolution: all players with figures in the region calculate their total strength in the battle. each figure provides 1 strength, but individual abilities and powers may increase this amount. each battle card also has a bonus strength value which is added to that player’s total (as long as they have any figures in the region). the player with the highest total strength wins the battle. they gain 1 devotion and kill all enemy figures in the region (warriors and guardians, since gods can never be killed). on a tie, and one of the tied players holds the tiebreaker token faceup, that player may use it to break the tie and win the battle. the token is flipped facedown and may not be used again in any remaining battles that occur during this conflict event. on a tie, and the tiebreaker token is not used, all players lose the battle. all figures in the region are killed (except for gods). killed figures are returned to their players’ pools.all battle cards a player has used must remain faceup on the table next to them, clearly visible to the other players. which cards a player has already used is open information for opponents to consider when trying to outguess each other. merging gods only in a game with 3 or more players, at the end of the 3rd conflict, the 2 gods with the least devotion (the ones in the bottom 2 positions in the devotion track) merge into a single god. the players controlling these 2 gods now play as a team for the rest of the game, winning or losing together. once the 3rd conflict event has been fully resolved, perform the following steps in order: 1. determine the 2 gods that will merge: the god in the second- lowest position on the devotion track is the higher-merging god and the god in the lowest position on the devotion track is the lower-merging god. 2. destroy all monuments controlled by the lower-merging god, returning them to the supply. remove the god figure, warriors, battle cards, and pool of ankh tokens belonging to the lower-merging god from the game. give all of that god’s followers to the higher-merging god. the higher-merging god may gain control of any guardians that belonged to the lower-merging god, even if they already have it or didn’t unlock the corresponding ankh yet. if the player doesn’t have enough color bases of the corresponding size available, they must choose which guardians to control and the others are removed from the game. 3. on the devotion track, move the higher-merging god’s ankh token and place it on top of the lower-merging god’s ankh token. those 2 ankh tokens move together on the devotion track as a single entity for the rest of the game. 4. the lower god player attaches one of their large color bases to the higher god figure to represent that they are now a single god. 5. the lower-merging god adjusts their ankh powers to match those of the higher-merging god (possibly unlocking more or less than they originally had). 6. the merged god has the special god abilities of both gods. both players exchange their merged god dashboards, placing them next to their god dashboard so they each have both god abilities visible. 7. both players controlling the merged god share the pool of warriors, guardians, and followers that originally belonged to the higher god. merged god gameplay for the rest of the game, the 2 players who had their gods merge continue taking turns as normal, however each player takes only a single action per turn, and they now share and control the same common pool of figures, follower tokens, and ankh tokens. they do not have to take different actions. they can both use both god abilities’ on their turn, as well as their identical ankh powers. the players controlling the merged god must always keep the ankh powers on their god dashboards in sync with each other. if one merged player unlocks an ankh power, the other merged player must immediately update their god dashboard (though all powers and effects still only apply once to the merged god). if one of the players gains control of a new guardian, it receives one of the higher god’s color bases and is placed in their collective pool of figures to be summoned by either player. decisions during battles are made by both players using the higher god’s battle cards. if there is a disagreement between the 2 players, the higher god player decides. both players either win or lose together.forgotten gods at the end of the 4th conflict event, any gods with their ankh token still in the red section of the devotion track are eliminated from the game. remove the forgotten gods’ figures (god, warriors, and guardians) from the game. destroy all of their monuments, returning them to the supply, and return all of their followers to the supply. if, at this point, there are still 2 or more gods in play, the game continues. if there is only 1 god left, that player wins the game. if all gods are forgotten, all players lose. winning the game there are 3 ways to win the game: 1. a player wins immediately when their ankh token reaches the top space of the devotion track. 2. a player wins immediately if they are the only god left in play after the 4th conflict event. (if no gods are left in play at this stage, the game ends in a draw.) 3. if neither of the previous conditions are met, the game is won by the player with the most devotion after the last event on the track is resolved."
18,41933,ARCTIC SCAVENGERS,2009,RIO GRANDE GAMES,2.2639,144,"setup each player takes an identical starter deck of 10 cards: 4 refugee cards, 3 scavenger cards, 1 brawler card, 1 spear card, and 1 shovel card. shuffle your starter deck and place it facedown in front of you. remove any leftover refugee cards from the game. sort the remaining cards into contested resources , junkyard , and mercenaries (those with character portraits and a cost). shuffle the contested resources cards and place them facedown on the contested resources mat to form the contested resources deck. shuffle the junkyard cards and place them facedown on the junkyard mat to form the junkyard deck. sort the mercenaries into 8 separate decks, by mercenary type, and place the decks faceup in the play area. a randomly selected first player takes the initiator card and is the initiator for the first round. 2 players remove 2 cards of each kind from the junkyard.eliminate all contested resources peeking. skirmishes must be won by 2. if not, place the contested resource on top of the junkyard and then shuffle the junkyard. the number of tribe members in a skirmish is no longer relevant. game round drawing discard all cards from the previous round. each player draws 5 cards from the top of their deck. shuffle the discard pile and add it to the deck when your deck becomes exhausted. beginning with the third round, and continuing for the remainder of the game, the initiator peeks at the top card on the contested resources deck and then returns it to the top of the deck. resource gathering the initiator takes the first action and uses any number of cards to gather resources. then announce how many of your cards will remain for the skirmish, keeping them facedown (you may bluff by including cards that cannot be used in the skirmish). play continues with the other players in clockwise order, each gathering resources and readying for the skirmish. skirmish (starts on round 3) once all players have taken their resource gathering actions, players simultaneously reveal their remaining cards for the skirmish and a winner is determined. the winner of the skirmish takes the top card from the contested resources deck and adds it to their discard pile. the initiator passes the initiator card to the player on their left, starting a new round.resource gathering during this phase, play any number of cards from your hand to your discard pile in order to add more cards to your deck. there is no limit to the number of actions that you can take during the resource gathering phase, although no action may be taken more than once. dig draw 1 or more cards from the top of the junkyard deck. you may choose 1 to place in your discard pile and return any other cards to the bottom of the junkyard deck. the number of cards is determined by the sum of all the dig numbers on the card(s) played from your hand. you may immediately discard junk cards to the bottom of the junkyard (you do not get another dig). hunt this generates food in the round that can then be used as currency for purchasing a single mercenary card. the amount of food generated is determined by adding up all hunt abilities played from your hand. you can assign tools to mercenaries to improve their hunt abilities. hire this is a free action (no card required). pay the cost on one of the mercenary cards from the faceup mercenary decks and add the card to your discard pile. there are 2 currencies: food and medicine (meds) . thugs can be hired using any combination of food and meds totaling 6 units. food is created in realtime using the hunt action. meds come from medicine cards that must be played from your hand to complete the purchase (they do not require an associated person to spend). you may only hire 1 mercenary per round. draw draw 1 or more cards from your deck, adding them to your hand. multiple cards may be combined to draw several cards. trash this is a free action (no card required). take any number of cards from your hand and add them to the junkyard supply deck. do not draw cards from your deck to replace these cards. special actions some cards may grant special actions that can be used during the resource gathering phase. using tools each player starts with 2 tools : a spear and a shovel. you can find additional tools by digging in the junkyard. tools cannot perform actions on their own; a tribe member can use only one tool that enhances the value of the action the tribe member is performing. using a tool does not grant a tribe member an ability that the tribe member cannot inherently perform. a card must have a base ability to improve it with a tool.group leaders do not count as a tool when counting equipment limits. a refugee combined with a group leader becomes capable of dig or hunt. a tribe family enhanced by a group leader can attack or hunt. shuffling the junkyard when players use the trash action, or skirmishing for a contested resource ends in a tie, cards are added to the junkyard. place them facedown on top of the junkyard and then shuffle the entire junkyard deck. skirmish phase resolve a skirmish by starting with the initiator, who declares any actions performed by their units (eg, saboteurs and sniper teams). play then passes to the next player clockwise, who declares actions for their units (provided that they were not sniped or disarmed by the previous player). this continues until all skirmish actions have been resolved. the sum of the fight values on your cards represents the strength of your attack. all rules related to tool usage also apply to tools used as weapons during the skirmish. the player with the highest fight value wins. the winning player draws the top card from the contested resources supply pile and adds it to their discard pile without revealing it to the other players. on a tie, each player sums the number of people involved in the skirmish (including refugees and tribe families that may not be directly contributing to the fight score) and the player with the most people involved wins the skirmish. on a further tie, the skirmish is a deadlock; place the top card from the contested resources pile into the junkyard deck without looking at it and shuffle the deck. saboteurs and sniper teams a saboteur or sniper team may be used during the resource gathering phase or the skirmish phase. play a saboteur from your hand (or from the cards you commit to a skirmish) and declare the attack to prevent one another player from using a single tool card . play a sniper team from your hand (or from the cards you commit to a skirmish) and declare the attack to force one another player to discard a single person card . after a snipe action is performed, the sniped player may rearrange his available tools as desired. if played during the resource gathering phase, the saboteur or sniper team card is discarded after use. winning when the final contested resource card has been won, the game ends. each player counts the total number of tribe members in their deck. the winner is the player with the largest tribe.on a tie, the tied player with the most contested resource cards wins. on a further tie, the tied player with the largest number of cards in their deck wins. on a further tie, the tied players share the victory.headquarters expansion module 1: medics, tools, and gangs set up the game as normal. add the deck of medic cards alongside the other mercenary cards. shuffle the 8 new junkyard cards into the junkyard deck (ignore the special ability of the toolkit). place the gearheads and pharmers gang cards next to the mercenary stacks. medics medics have a draw of 1, can be played from the hand during a hire action to represent 1 med, and can also be played from the hand to save another tribe member card from a sniper attack (they can even be used to save another player’s tribe member from sniper attack). save action protects a tribe member or leader from a snipe attack. tools the rifle is good at hunting and fighting. . a toolkit can be used to enhance digging (either junkyard or engineering schematics) or can be handed to any tribe member that is used to speed up the building process on a building. the toolkit enables additional cards to be removed from one building that is under construction. gangs once all of the contested resources have been gathered, gangs form alliances with players as follows: gearheads determine ‘most tools’ by adding up all the cards with a tool icon from each player’s deck. break ties by counting the total number of tools that are contested resources. pharmers determine ‘most meds’ by adding the total ‘meds’ value of all pills and medkits in a player’s deck. break ties by counting the total number of medics. masons determine ‘most buildings’ by adding the total number of completed and enabled buildings each player has in their headquarters. break ties by adding up the total number of engineers. module 2: engineers and buildings set up the game as you did for module #1. add the stack of engineer cards alongside the other mercenary cards. shuffle the 12 building cards and place them facedown next to the junkyard deck. place the masons card (masons) next to the other gangs. the special ability of the toolkit can now be used (since it works with buildings). engineers engineers can dig in the junkyard for resources, but the primary use of their dig action is to dig in the engineering schematics deck (they are the only mercenary capable of doing so). other cards with a dig ability can be combined with the engineer to improve engineering schematics digging. buildings you can use engineers to construct buildings at your headquarters. they take time to build, but once built offer you strategic advantages. the process of constructing a building is as follows: 1. play an engineer card. 2. use the engineer’s dig (combined with any modifiers) to draw cards from the engineering schematics pile equal to the dig value. 3. select 1 card to build and return the others to the bottom of the engineering schematics deck. 4. place the new building card faceup in your play area. 5. draw cards from your deck equal to the building’s build time and place them facedown on top of the new building to represent the build timer. 6. place the engineer card in your discard pile. 7. at the start of your next round, remove 1 card from each building that is under construction. 8. starting with the round following the initial building placement, additional tribe members (and toolkits) may be played from your hand to accelerate construction on 1 building. each tribe member played can remove 1 card from a building that is under construction. if wielding a toolkit, 2 additional cards may be removed. tribe members that work on construction projects may not take any other actions that round and are immediately discarded. 9. once a building has 0 cards stacked on it, it is complete and immediately goes into effect. building types armory up to 2 tools stored under this card may be retrieved at any time (except during the skirmish). 1 or 2 cards may be placed in this building at a time. bunker up to 3 tribe member cards stored under this card may be retrieved at any time (except during the skirmish). up to 3 cards may be placed in this building at a time. hydroponic generates 1 food each round (in the same way as a hunt, though this is not affected by hunting- related modifiers) to be used as part of a hire action. gardens food does not accumulate from round to round.pharmacy up to 2 medicine cards (pills or medkit, but not tribe members such as medic) stored under this card may be retrieved at any time (except during the skirmish). 1 or 2 cards may be placed in this building at a time. using buildings buildings may usually only be used during a player’s turn. buildings may never be used during the skirmish. during another player’s turn, the only building which a player may access is the bunker. during your turn, you may place cards into the bunker, armory, or pharmacy, or cards may be retrieved from these buildings. once you have committed cards to the skirmish, you cannot place cards into a building or add cards from a building to the skirmish. once you have committed cards to the skirmish, no change may take place in those cards except when using a saboteur or sniper team from the committed cards to interrupt another player’s resource gathering. store action take 1 or more cards of a given type from your hand and place them, facedown, under a completed building. do not exceed the building capacity or violate its type. retrieve action take 1 or more cards from an active building and place them in your hand. this action can occur any time during a round as long the skirmish has not been initiated. module 3: tribal leaders set up the game as you did for module #2. shuffle the tribal leader cards and deal 2 facedown to each player. each player looks at their 2, places 1 faceup in their play area, and removes the other from the game. tribal leaders butcher / cannibal / fanatic cards removed from play cannot return to the game and do not count toward final scoring. butcher / cannibal / sergeant at arms these leaders can use their special abilities without the need for playing a refugee. excavator / fanatic / gangster / mentor / organizer / peacemaker / ranger require the use of a refugee to utilize the leader’s special ability. butcher / cannibal / fanatic / mentor / organizer / peacemaker these leaders grant abilities that can only be used once per round. excavator / gangster / ranger / sergeant of arms these leaders grant abilities that are always in effect and could impact multiple cards in a given round. module 4: dirty deeds set up the game just as you did for module #3. new saboteur ability a saboteur may attack a building that is completed and disable it, rendering it unusable (flip the building’s card over to indicate it is disabled). if a building is disabled, its abilities cannot be used and cards cannot be added or removed from the building. to repair the building, a person card must be played from the player’s hand to work on the building and then immediately discarded. new sniper team ability a sniper team may attack a tribe leader, wounding him (turn the leader’s card over to indicate he or she is injured). this removes the leader’s advantage until a med is applied against the leader to heal him."

20,205637,ARKHAM HORROR: THE CARD GAME,2016,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,3.5232,1273,"setup each player chooses a different investigator and places that investigator’s card in their play area. choose a player to be the lead investigator: that player takes the campaign guide. assemble and shuffle the players’ investigator decks. place the damage, horror, clue/doom, and resource tokens in separate piles. choose a difficulty level and place the chaos tokens indicated by the campaign setup instructions into the chaos bag (an opaque container). return the other chaos tokens to the box. each player takes 5 resources and places them near their investigator card as their resource pool. each player draws 5 cards from their deck. if you draw a weakness card, draw an additional card, then shuffle the weakness back into your deck. each player may take a single mulligan at this time by setting aside up to 5 of the cards just drawn, drawing an equivalent number of cards, and shuffling the set-aside cards back into their deck. read the scenario introduction in the campaign guide and perform the scenario setup instructions: gathering the listed encounter sets, placing locations, placing investigator mini cards at the location(s) investigators begin play, setting aside any listed cards, and shuffling remaining encounter cards together to form the encounter deck. assemble the agenda deck in sequential order, art side faceup, with 1a on top. read the story text on 1a. place the scenario reference card next to the agenda deck assemble the act deck in sequential order, art side faceup, with 1a on top. read the story text on act 1a. there are no action windows during setup. players may only trigger player card abilities or play cards from hand during setup if the card or ability’s specific triggering condition is met. key concepts if the text on a card directly contradicts the text of the rules, text on the card takes precedence. if it is possible to observe both the card text and the text of the rules, both are observed. if the players are required to make a choice among 2 or more equally valid options, the lead investigator chooses among those options. when players are instructed to do something ‘in player order,’ the lead investigator does so first, followed by each other player, one player at a time, in clockwise order. the grim rule if the players are unsure how to resolve a rules or timing conflict, resolve it in the manner the players perceive as the worst possible at that moment with regard to winning the scenario, and continue with the game. per investigator next to a value multiplies that value by the number of investigators who started the scenario. ready and exhausted cards enter play in a ready position (upright). to use some card abilities, the card must exhaust, (rotate 90 degrees). an exhausted card cannot exhaust again until it is readied by a game step or card ability. locations each location has a revealed side (with a shroud value and a clue value) and an unrevealed side (keyhole symbol below the title). a location enters play unrevealed side faceup. clues may be placed on a location during setup if the investigators begin play there, or if the setup rules instruct players to reveal a location.round sequence each round is divided into 4 phases. during the first round, skip the mythos phase and proceed to the investigation phase. the mythos phase resolve these steps, in order. 1. place 1 doom token on the current agenda. 2. compare the total number of doom tokens in play (on the current agenda and on other cards in play) to the doom threshold of the current agenda. if the number is equal to or greater than the threshold (and there are no objective requirements), advance the agenda deck. 3. in player order, each investigator draws the top card of the encounter deck. resolve each type of encounter card: treachery resolve the card’s ability, then place it on the encounter discard pile. enemy the enemy spawns engaged with the investigator who drew the card, unless it has a spawn instruction, in which case it spawns at the indicated location. the investigation phase each investigator takes a separate turn. players, as a group, choose which investigator takes the first turn. when an investigator’s turn ends, choose an investigator to take the next turn, and so on, until each investigator has taken his turn. each investigator has 3 actions during his turn. you may perform any of the following tasks, as many times as you like and in any order, providing you have an action available to pay for that task. if you are engaged with one or more ready enemies, and take an action other than evade, fight, or activate a parley or resign ability, each of those enemies makes an attack of opportunity against you (in an order of your choice). each attack deals that enemy’s damage and horror to your investigator and the enemy does not exhaust. if you end your turn early, unused actions are lost and cannot be saved for future turns. after each investigator has completed his turn, play proceeds to the enemy phase. on your turn, you may use an action to: draw draw 1 card from the top of your deck. if your deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile back into your deck; then after completing the entire draw take 1 horror. resource gain 1 resource from the token pool. activate resolve an (action trigger) ability on a card in play under your control (including your investigator card), on a scenario card at your location (the location itself, encounter cards there, and encounter cards in the threat area of any investigator there) or on the current act or agenda card. you must use 1 action for each specified in the ability’s cost. engage engage 1 enemy that is at your location. to engage an enemy, place that enemy in your threat area. you may engage an enemy that is engaged with another investigator at the same location. investigate attempt to find clues in your location. make an intellect test against the shroud value of that location. if the skill test is successful, take 1 clue that was on the location and place it on your investigator card. if the test is failed, no clues are discovered. evade attempt to evade 1 enemy you are engaged with. make an agility test against that enemy’s evade value.if the test is successful, the enemy is exhausted and the engagement is broken; move the enemy from your threat area to your current location. if the test fails, the enemy remains engaged with you. move move your mini card to any other location marked as a connection on your current location. connections are indicated by the icons at the bottom of the location card, each matching an identical icon in the title area of each connecting location. when an investigator enters a location for the first time, turn it to its revealed side, and put clues equal to its clue value on it. play select an asset or event card in your hand, pay its resource cost (from your resource pool), and play it. event card: resolve its effects, then place it in its owner’s discard pile. asset card: place it in your play area; it remains in play until an ability or game effect causes it to leave play. skill cards are not played. for their abilities and icons to be used, they must be committed to a skill test from your hand. cards with the fast keyword do not cost an action to play.slots restrict the number of cards of a specific category you can have in play at a time. if your asset has one or more slot symbols, it may only enter play if you have those slots available. the slots available to an investigator are: 1 ally slot, 1 body slot, 1 accessory slot, 2 hand slots, and 2 arcane slots. if you wish to play or gain control of an asset that requires a slot already full, you must choose and discard asset(s) under your control to make room for the new asset. fight attack any 1 enemy at your location. make a combat test against the enemy’s fight value. if the test is successful, you deal 1 damage to the attacked enemy (this may be modified by some weapons, spells, or other special attacks). place damage tokens equal to the amount of damage dealt on the enemy. an enemy with as much (or more) damage on it as it has health is defeated and placed in the encounter discard pile. if the bottom of the enemy’s text box indicates that it provides victory points, place the card in a shared victory pile instead of discarding it. if the test fails, no damage is dealt to the attacked enemy. however, if you fail a combat test against an enemy engaged with another investigator, the damage value of the failed attack is instead dealt to the investigator engaged with that enemy. the enemy phase resolve these steps in order. if there are no enemies in play, proceed to the upkeep phase. 1. hunter enemies move. each enemy with the hunter keyword moves once, to a connecting location, in the direction of the nearest investigator. exhausted hunter enemies, and hunter enemies at a location with 1 or more investigators, do not move. if a hunter enemy moves to a location with 1 or more investigators, it immediately engages one of them. 2. enemy attacks. each ready, engaged enemy makes an attack against the investigator with which it is engaged. resolve enemy attacks in player order. when an enemy attacks, deal both its damage and its horror, simultaneously, to the engaged investigator. after an enemy attacks during the enemy phase, exhaust it to indicate that it has attacked. during attacks of opportunity, enemies do not exhaust.the upkeep phase resolve these steps, in order: 1. each investigator turns his mini card faceup. 2. ready all exhausted cards. each unengaged enemy that readies at the same location as an investigator engages at this time. 3. each investigator draws 1 card and gains 1 resource. 4. each investigator with more than 8 cards in hand chooses and discards cards from his hand until only 8 cards remain. after the above steps are complete, the round is over. proceed to the mythos phase of the next round. skills and skill tests each investigator has 4 skills: willpower , intellect , combat , and agility . to perform a skill test, reveal a random chaos token from the chaos bag. this modifies your skill value; if the modified skill value equals or exceeds the test’s difficulty, you succeed. before drawing a chaos token, you may boost your skill value. there are 2 ways to do this: 1. you may commit cards from your hand with one or more icons matching the skill type of the test. a wild icon matches all skill types. each matching icon increases the investigator’s skill value by 1 for that test. the investigator performing the test may commit any number of cards to the test, and each other investigator at the same location as that investigator may commit 1 card from their hand to help. do not pay a card’s resource cost when committing it to a skill test. 2. you may activate free trigger abilities to modify your skill for a test. some skill cards have an ability that resolves upon the completion of a skill test, if the card is committed to that test. after a skill test, discard all investigator cards committed to it, and return the revealed chaos token to the chaos bag. chaos token effects refer to the scenario reference card and resolve the corresponding effect. elder sign resolve the effect on your investigator card. auto-fail the skill test automatic fails. if the revealed chaos token (or the effect referenced) has a numerical modifier, apply it to your skill value for the test. asset cards when you are dealt damage or horror, you may assign some or all of that damage or horror to eligible asset cards you control. most assets take up one or more slots while in play. assets with an encounter set icon and no level indicator are story assets. they may not be included in your deck unless the resolution or setup of a scenario allows it. attachments are placed beneath and slightly overlapped by the specified game element. they remain attached until either the attachment or the element to which it is attached leaves play (in which case the attachment is discarded), or unless a card ability explicitly detaches the card. an attachment exhausts and readies independently of the element it’s attached to.advancing the decks if an act or agenda card has an objective instruction, that overrides the procedure for advancing the deck. act deck generally, investigators can advance the act deck by spending, as a group, clues equal to the value at the bottom of the current act card’s text box (return spent clues from the investigators’ cards to the general token pool). advancing the act in this way does not cost an action and may be done during any investigator’s turn. agenda deck the agenda deck advances if the number of doom shown on the agenda card is in play (on the agenda card as well as on any other cards in play). advancing a deck to advance a deck, remove all tokens from the card. in the case of the agenda deck, remove all doom from each card in play. flip the current card over, follow the instructions on the reverse, and remove it from the game. the next card in the deck becomes the new current card unless otherwise specified. when advancing the act deck, any clues the investigators have gained (but are not spending) remain in their play area. enemy engagement while an enemy card is in play, either it is engaged with an investigator (and placed in that player’s threat area), or it is placed at a location. each enemy in your threat area is considered to be at your location. if you move, the enemy remains engaged with you and moves with you. any time a ready non-engaged enemy is at your location, it engages you and is placed in your threat area. if multiple investigators are at the same location as a ready enemy, the lead investigator chooses which of those investigators the enemy engages. if an enemy has a prey instruction, that dictates whom it engages if there is a conflict. an enemy will immediately engage if: it spawns (in a ready state) at the same location as an investigator. it moves (in a ready state) to the same location as an investigator. an investigator moves to the same location as a ready enemy.an exhausted enemy is readied at the same location as an investigator. damage and horror when your investigator is dealt damage, place damage on your investigator card and/or on any of your investigator’s asset cards that have health, up to the amount of damage each card can hold. a card that has no health value cannot be dealt damage. when your investigator is dealt horror, place horror on your investigator card and/or on any of your investigator’s asset cards that have sanity, up to the amount of horror each card can hold. a card that has no sanity value cannot be dealt horror. all damage/horror that cannot be assigned to an asset must be assigned to the investigator. if an ability causes a card to take direct damage or direct horror, it must be assigned directly to that card. if a card has an amount of damage that equals or exceeds its health, or an amount of horror that equals or exceeds its sanity, the card is defeated. a defeated asset card or enemy is discarded. a defeated investigator is eliminated from the scenario. remove all their cards from the game and return their resource tokens to the pool and other cards to their discard piles; any card they owned but didn’t control that is in play remains in play, but if that card leaves play it is removed from the game. all their clue tokens are placed at the location the investigator was at when eliminated, as are engaged enemies, now unengaged but otherwise maintaining their current game state. abilities constant abilities (no special formatting) are always interacting with the game state as long as the card is in play. forced abilities initiate and interact with the game state automatically at a specified timing point. revelation abilities initiate as that card is drawn by an investigator. free triggered abilities ( ) may be triggered as a player ability during any player window. reaction triggered abilities ( ) may be triggered any time that triggering condition is met. action triggered abilities ( ) may be triggered during a player’s turn in the investigation phase through the use of the activate action, if you use 1 action for each specified in the ability’s cost. some abilities have bold action designators (eg, fight, evade, investigate, or move). activating them performs the designated action, but modified in the manner described. if an ability refers to a player’s collection, the collection of cards from which that player’s deck was assembled is used. unique cards there can be no more than one instance of each unique (*) card, by title, in play at any given time. if a unique encounter card that shares a title with a unique player card would enter play, discard the player card simultaneously as the encounter card enters play. cooperating and table talk investigators should work together and plan out what they hope to accomplish each round. however each individual player has final authority over the actions their investigator performs. players work together and communicate during the game, and are encouraged to stay ‘in character’ as much as possible while doing so. it is recommended that player’s do not name, read off, or allude to individual cards that are hidden information (ie, in a player’s hand or deck). winning and losing the act deck represents the progress of the investigators through a scenario. the players’ primary objective is to gather clues and use them to advance through the act deck until a (hopefully favorable) resolution is reached. the agenda deck represents the objectives and progress of the dark forces in the scenario. should the agenda deck reach its conclusion, a (usually darker) resolution will occur. when any encounter card triggers a resolution (→r#), the players have completed the scenario and should refer to the resolution text that matches that number in the campaign guide to discover what happens next. should all investigators be eliminated during a scenario, the “if no resolution was reached” conclusion in the campaign guide is used."

this is heavy! you may move lorraine up to 2 spaces toward you. lorraine may not be moved into or through town square. doc brown: great scott! you may move to the delorean’s location. when using this power, doc may not escort george or lorraine. jennifer parker: follow me! you may move marty, doc, or einstein up to 2 spaces toward you. einstein: bark! bark! if biff is within 1 space of einstein, you may move biff up to 2 spaces in any direction. biff may not be moved into or through town square. end of your turn after all of your power tiles and item cards have been exhausted and you have used your special character power, your turn is over. however, you may choose to end your turn at any time, even if some power tiles are not yet exhausted (they are still faceup), and even if you haven’t used your item cards or special character power. refresh all of your item cards and power tiles by flipping them faceup again. you may have a maximum of 8 power tiles (unless you have the backpack item card). if you received power tiles that have taken you over your limit, refresh them all and discard down to the limit. you may discard whichever power tiles you wish, including your starter power tiles. movement moving george and lorraine george and lorraine move either clockwise or counter- clockwise a certain number of spaces, or directly to a specified location. moving biff for each symbol on the movement card that moves biff, move him 1 space toward george or lorraine, whoever is nearest. if they are an equal number of spaces away, he moves toward lorraine. once biff is at the same location as either george or lorraine (or both), then each additional lowers the love meter by 1. symbols have this effect whether they appear on movement cards or are rolled on dice. george, lorraine, and biff never move into town square; they only move in the 9 locations around the perimeter of the board. moving your character you may use a power tile to move your character: flip it over, then move your character any number of adjacent spaces, up to the number indicated (diagonal spaces are not adjacent). you may visit the same space multiple times during the same movement.once a power tile has been flipped over to use for movement, it is exhausted, and its other abilities cannot be used until your next turn. while moving, if you stop at a location in order to take an action of any kind, your movement for that tile ends. you may, however, take another move action by using another available power tile. as you move, you may escort either george or lorraine (but not both at the same time) by moving them with you. you may pick them up or drop them off at any point during your movement. you may not escort george or lorraine into or through town square. challenge types if there are multiple challenge options at your location, declare the one you are attempting before rolling dice. influence love challenge attempt this challenge to raise the love meter, so george and lorraine will fall in love. requirement: you must be at the same location as both george and lorraine. resolution: for each love or wild symbol you roll, move the love meter cube 1 space up on the love meter. move delorean challenge attempt this challenge to move the delorean along the delorean track, first to doc brown’s house, then to the ready zone. requirement: you must be at the same location as the delorean. to move the delorean past doc brown’s house, you must have all 3 delorean parts. resolution: for each speed or wild symbol you roll, move the delorean 1 spot forward on the delorean track. if one attempt moves the delorean out of your current location, you must move to that new location if you want to attempt this challenge again this turn. fight biff challenge attempt this challenge to knock biff down and disable his movement and actions. requirements: you must be at the same location as biff and he cannot already be knocked down. resolution: if you roll 1 courage or wild symbol, biff is knocked down: put the biff figure on its side. for each additional courage or wild symbol you rolled, place a knockdown token next to biff. a maximum of 3 knockdown tokens may be placed next to a knocked down biff. while biff is knocked down, for each rolled on a die or shown on a movement card, instead of moving biff or lowering the love meter, remove 1 knockdown token. once all knockdown tokens have been removed, the next stands biff up again, and he resumes his normal behavior for any after that. prepare delorean challenge attempt this challenge to equip the time machine with the cable, the hook, and the gasoline. once the delorean is moved to the driveway spot at doc brown’s house, it cannot move again until you have obtained all 3 parts.requirements: you must be at the same location as the delorean part tile you are trying to obtain. resolution: if you roll the number of knowledge symbols shown on the part (and/or wild symbols), you obtain it. flip the delorean part tile over and place it at doc brown’s house. opportunity challenge each time you resolve an opportunity challenge, you are rewarded with a power tile, and possibly item cards and other beneficial effects. requirement: you must be at the same location as the opportunity card. if the card shows a character requirement, the listed character(s) must also be at the same location. resolution: if you roll the challenge symbol(s) shown, you successfully resolve the challenge and immediately gain the reward listed at the bottom of the card. after resolving an opportunity challenge, discard the card, draw a new one from the deck, and place it at the specified location. there will always be 3 opportunity cards on the board. any power tile or item card you get as a reward is automatically exhausted when you gain it. you cannot use it this turn (it will refresh at the end of your turn). trouble challenge requirement: you must be at the same location as the trouble card. resolution: if you roll the challenge symbol(s) on the card, you successfully resolve the challenge and immediately gain the reward listed at the bottom of the card. discard the card but do not draw a new one. rolling dice for challenges decide how many dice of each color to use before you roll. you may use up to as many dice as you have on your faceup power tiles. whichever dice you select are the only dice you may use for that attempt. as you collect dice to roll, flip over the corresponding power tiles to show that they are exhausted. each wild may be used as any one of the 4 symbols. if a power tile shows 2 dice, it allows you to roll one or both of the dice shown. if you choose to roll just one, you may not roll the other one for a different challenge attempt on this turn, because the tile is exhausted. you may not roll more than 2 dice of any one color during a challenge attempt. you do not have to roll dice that match the colors of the challenge symbols. although each die has a better chance of rolling its matching symbol, all dice have 2 wild symbols which may be used as any symbol. once you have selected the dice and exhausted the corresponding power tiles, roll all of the dice at the same time, then proceed through these steps: 1. lock biffs: set aside any dice that show a symbol. these are locked and may not be rerolled. 2. reroll (optional): you may reroll any unlocked dice if you wish to try to improve your results. as with your first roll, all rerolled dice that show a must be locked and may not be rolled again. you may choose to reroll as many dice as you wish that do not show a , until you choose to quit (or have no more dice to roll). 3. modify die rolls: if you have any power tiles or item cards that allow you to modify die rolls, you may use them now. each power tile or item card that you use to modify your roll may be used only once per turn. they are flipped over and exhausted when you use them. 4. resolve advantageous dice: apply the results. always address the non-biff symbol dice first. if you succeeded in a challenge, resolve it and receive any rewards or take any applicable actions. 5. resolve biff dice: each you rolled has the same effect as one on a movement card. remember that symbols remove knockdown tokens if biff is knocked down, as described in the fight biff challenge section. item cards when you first obtain an item card, place it facedown (gray side up) next to your character mat. it cannot be used this turn. you may use each item card once per turn. after using an item card, flip it facedown to indicate that it has been exhausted. the backpack item card, which allows you to keep 2 extra power tiles over your 8-tile limit, is the only item that is never exhausted. there is no limit to the number of item cards you may have. assisting other players players at the same location as the active player may assist in the active player’s challenges. an assisting player may exhaust their own faceup power tiles to roll dice along with the active player, and they may use faceup item cards and power tiles to modify die rolls. the active player must roll at least 1 die during any challenge in which somebody assists. any power tiles used to assist will be exhausted and unavailable on the assisting player’s next turn. end of the game the game can end in one of 2 ways: 1. the sixth and final section of the mcfly photo is turned facedown so that marty and his siblings have completely disappeared. the game ends immediately, and the players lose the game. 2. lightning strikes at 10:04pm, when the turn tracker cube moves onto the final space on the turn tracker. the game ends immediately, with one of 2 outcomes: a. if the love meter cube is in the heart zone and the delorean is in the ready zone, the players win the game. b. if the love meter cube is not in the heart zone and/or the delorean is not in the ready zone, the players lose the game."
25,222514,BATMAN: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES,2019,MONOLITH GAMES,3.7414,116,"setup set up the board, tokens, scenery and miniatures as indicated by the scenario. the villain takes their tiles and sets them up in their command post. the hero players take hero boards and choose any required equipment and/or bat-gadget cards. all players set up their energy cubes allotment. the distance between 2 areas is measured by counting the minimum number of moves that separates them (not the move cost). there can never be a negative value in the game. any result that would be negative is considered equal to 0. game round sequence a. upkeep advance the turn marker the side with initiative moves the turn marker forward 1 space on the turn track. trigger upkeep phase effects resolve any effects specified in the mission that trigger at this time. if several happen simultaneously, the side with initiative chooses the order. b. turn of the side with initiative the mission indicates which side first has initiative (blue for heroes, grey for the villain). c. check end game conditions 1 the mission describes the end game conditions. if at least 1 of these is fulfilled, the game immediately ends and the winner is determined. if not, the turn continues. d. turn of the side without initiative e. check end game conditions 2 the mission describes the end game conditions. if at least 1 of these is fulfilled, the game immediately ends and the winner is determined. if not, the turn continues with a new turn. hero turn 1. upkeep hero start of turn move all energy cubes spent by heroes during the villain’s turn to those heroes’ fatigue zones. 2. trigger start of hero turn effects resolve any effects that trigger at the start of the hero turn. if several happen simultaneously, the heroes choose the order. 3. declare hero stance each hero must choose their stance: active or resting. a neutralized hero must choose the resting stance. active stance: place your stance marker active hero side faceup, then move the number of energy cubes indicated from your fatigue zone to your reserve zone. if there are not enough cubes in the fatigue zone, move the rest from wound zone to fatigue zone. resting stance: place your stance marker resting hero side faceup, then move the number of energy cubes indicated on the marker as above. a resting hero can only perform free actions, rerolls and defenses. 4. choose acting hero the hero players decide who will be the first acting hero from among those who wish to perform actions. this hero carries out the hero actions step. if no heroes are active, or none wish to perform an action, skip to the trigger end of hero turn effects step.5. hero actions the acting hero declares which of the 5 actions they wish to perform and then carries out that action. then, if at least 1 active hero still wishes to perform action(s), the heroes return to the previous step. if none of the active heroes want to perform an action, continue to the next step. 6. trigger end of hero turn effects resolve any effects that trigger at the end of the hero turn. if several happen simultaneously, the heroes choose the order. 7. upkeep hero end of turn move all energy cubes spent by the heroes during their turn to those heroes’ fatigue zones. hero actions melee attack 1. declare a melee attack: the hero declaring the melee attack is the attacker. 2. declare the target (defender): if unable to declare a target, the attack ends immediately. the defender must be in the same area as the attacker, or in an adjacent area the attacker would over-occupy and to which they have los. 3. spend energy cubes: move the number of energy cubes you wish to spend (min 1) from your reserve zone to your melee attack action space. you cannot spend energy cubes to the melee attack action space if you would exceed its exertion limit (if the limit has been reached, the action ends). 4. create the dice pool: take as many dice (your melee attack characteristic specifies the color) as the amount of cubes spent. 5. add weapon bonuses if using a melee attack weapon card. 6. roll your dice pool.7. rerolls: you may attempt to improve the result by rerolling. 8. total successes: melee attacks are not affected by hindering. 9. defending and wounds: the defender must defend themselves, and then apply any wounds. ranged attack 1. declare a ranged attack: the hero declaring the ranged attack is the attacker. you can only perform a ranged attack if you are carrying a ranged weapon you can use. 2. declare the target (defender): you must have los to the defender. there is los between 2 areas if an imaginary straight line can be drawn between their los markers without crossing walls, promontories or an area with an elevation higher than the 2 areas. between 2 areas of different elevation levels, the los must also not cross an area with an elevation level equal to the higher level of the 2 areas. note that los can begin or end on a promontory without being blocked. there is also los if the areas are adjacent and separated by an orange area boundary, or if they have at least 1 letter in common around their los markers. a miniature always has los to its own area, and los is not blocked by miniatures. 3. spend energy cubes: move the number of energy cubes you wish to spend (min 1) from your reserve zone to your ranged attack action space. you cannot spend energy cubes to the ranged attack action space if you would exceed its exertion limit (if the limit has been reached, the action ends). 4. create the dice pool: take as many dice (your ranged attack characteristic specifies the color) as the amount of cubes spent. 5. add weapon bonuses from the ranged attack weapon card you used. if you target a defender in an area at a lower elevation, add an extra yellow die elevation bonus to your dice pool.6. roll your dice pool. 7. rerolls: you may attempt to improve the result by rerolling.8. total successes: ranged attacks are affected by hindering, so subtract the hindering index from the number of successes. 9. defending and wounds: the defender must defend themselves, and then apply any wounds. manipulation complex manipulation 1. declare a complex manipulation: you may only throw a piece of equipment, or perform complex manipulations specified by the mission or in your skills description. 2. spend energy cubes: move the number of energy cubes you wish to spend (min 1) from your reserve zone to your manipulation action space. you cannot spend energy cubes to the manipulation action space if you would exceed its exertion limit (if the limit has been reached, the action ends). 3. create the dice pool: take as many dice (your manipulation characteristic specifies the color) as the amount of cubes spent. 4. add tool card bonuses: you constantly benefit from these bonuses. 5. roll your dice pool. 6. rerolls: you may attempt to improve the result by rerolling. 7. total successes: complex manipulations are affected by hindering, so the hindering index must be subtracted from the number of successes. compare the result to the action’s difficulty level. if the result is equal to or higher, you succeed and continue to the next step. if the result is lower, you fail. 8. apply the complex manipulation. automatic manipulation 1. declare an automatic manipulation: you may only give a piece of equipment, take a piece of equipment, pick up a piece of equipment, or perform automatic manipulations specified by the mission or in your skills description. 2. spend 1 energy cube: move 1 energy cube from your reserve zone to your manipulation action space. if the exertion limit has already been reached, the action ends. 3. apply the automatic manipulation: an automatic manipulation is always a success, and is not affected by hindering. thought complex thought works in the same way as complex manipulation. automatic thought works in the same way as automatic manipulation. movement 1. declare a movement. 2. create the move point (mp) pool: the mp pool equals 0 plus bonuses from skills, traits and special rules. 3. add mp bonus for the first movement: if this movement action is the first of your turn for this miniature, add your mp bonus to the mp pool. 4. choose move type: the area where your miniature is located is the start area. choose the destination area. you cannot enter an area if you would over-occupy it. a simple move crosses a white or orange area boundary from one area to an adjacent area. a special move is indicated in the board rules by a fall, jump, or climb icon, and is always associated with a level. calculate the move cost: simple move: 1 mp + hindering index of start area + total level of difficult terrain in the start area. special move: fall: 1 mp + hindering index of start area + total level of difficult terrain in the start area.jump: 1 mp + jump level + hindering index of start area + total level of difficult terrain in start area. climb: 1 mp + climb level + hindering index of start area + total level of difficult terrain in start area. 5. spend energy cubes: if the move cost is higher than the mp pool, you must spend energy cubes to the movement space to buy the missing mps. each spent cube gives you as many mps as your movement characteristic: add these to your mp pool. if the exertion limit of the movement space has been reached or if you cannot buy the missing mps, skip to the end move step. you cannot spend energy cubes on the movement space if you would exceed its exertion limit. if the move cost is equal or lower than the mp pool, proceed to the next step. 6. spend mps: subtract the cost of the move from the mp pool. 7. move the miniature to the destination area. 8. apply the effects of the destination area: if the miniature performs a fall, roll the same number of yellow dice as the level of the fall and then suffer wounds equal to the number of successes. 9. end move: if you wish to perform another move during this movement action, return to the choose move type step. if not, or you cannot move again, continue to the end movement step. 10. end movement: reduce the mp pool to 0; you lose all unused mps and your movement ends. villain turn 1. upkeep villain move all energy cubes not in your fatigue or reserve zones to your fatigue zone. move a number of energy cubes from your fatigue zone to your reserve zone equal to the mission’s recovery value. 2. trigger start of villain turn effects resolve any effects that trigger at the start of the villain turn. if several happen simultaneously, choose the order. 3. activate the first tile you may activate 0-2 tiles per turn. if you activate at least 1 tile, continue; otherwise skip to the trigger end of villain turn effects step. choose a tile to activate in the river and spend its activation cost (the number above the tile on the track) by moving that number of energy cubes from your reserve zone to your fatigue zone. move the activated tile to the end of the river to the right, and slide the remaining tiles to the left. if you have chosen a character tile, activate any number of the tile’s characters (or none, if you wish). each of the characters controlled by the tile can be activated once, and you must finish the activation of a character before you move on to the next active character. each character has the option to move, then the option to carry out an action (melee attack, ranged attack, manipulation, or thought), then another option to move. a character only gets the mp bonus the first time they move, and once they stop, they lose any remaining mp bonus. you must spend energy cubes to move further (up to the exertion limit). a character may repeat their action as long as they have not exceeded their multiplier value. if you chose the event tile, you gain a number of reinforcement points and must carry out the mission-specific events. 4. activate the second tile if you wish to activate a second tile, repeat the steps specified above. if not, skip to the trigger end of villain turn effects step. 6. trigger end of villain turn effects resolve any effects that trigger at the end of the villain turn. if several happen simultaneously, the villain chooses the order. defense 1. declare a defense. 2. spend energy cubes: move a number of energy cubes from your reserve zone to your defense space (min 0): this is your defense intensity. you cannot spend energy cubes to the defense space if you would exceed its exertion limit (if the limit has been reached, move directly to the add the automatic defense dice step). 3. create the dice pool: take as many dice (your defense characteristic specifies the color) as the amount of cubes spent. 4. add the automatic defense dice. 5. roll the dice pool. 6. rerolls: you may attempt to improve the result by rerolling. 7. total successes: add any automatic defense successes. defense is not affected by hindering. 8. determine the number of wounds: subtract the number of defense successes from the number of attacker successes. the result is the number of wounds suffered by the defender. rerolls 1. declare a reroll. 2. free rerolls: you may reroll 1 die of the specified color for every reroll icon (of the same color) you have. a die can be rerolled for free only once. you can use the free rerolls available to you; then roll the dice of the free reroll. 3. declare any paid rerolls: you may pay to carry out additional rerolls. choose 1 or more of the dice from the rolled dice pool (these can come from the free rerolls carried out in the previous step). if you do not want to reroll, end the rerolls. 4. spend energy cubes: move as many energy cubes as the number of dice you wish to reroll to the reroll space. you cannot spend energy cubes on the reroll space if you would exceed its exertion limit (if the limit has been reached, the reroll ends). 5. roll the chosen dice: decide if you will continue to carry out rerolls. if yes, return to the declare any paid rerolls step. if no, end the rerolls. hindering if a miniature performs a move, calculate the hindering index based on the size indexes of the other miniatures present in the area the miniature is leaving: hindering index (min 0) = total size index of enemy miniatures – total size index of allied miniatures. if a miniature performs a ranged attack, a complex manipulation, or a complex thought, calculate the hindering index based on the menace indexes of the other miniatures present in the action area: hindering index (min 0) = total menace index of enemy miniatures – total menace index of allied miniatures. in both cases, do not include the miniature performing the action in the calculation. the river reinforcement as soon as the villain gains reinforcement points, they must be spent. a miniature with a reinforcement cost on its tile can be returned to the game as a reinforcement if the villain spends the indicated reinforcement points. take the miniature from the character pool and place it in any of the reinforcement areas indicated in the mission by this token.a reinforced character must not over-occupy the area they are placed in. if a character must come into play in an area that it would over-occupy, it is placed in an adjacent area that it does not over-occupy. if the adjacent areas are all over-occupied, the character does not come into play. unspent reinforcement points are lost. when a miniature of a neutralized (facedown) tile is brought back into play, flip the tile faceup. the character pool represents the miniatures the villain can use as reinforcements. unless otherwise indicated, the pool of characters of a tile is 0. however, a mission may specify that miniatures should be placed in this pool during setup. dredging the river dredging the river is not an action and does not count as activating a tile. at any moment during their turn, the villain can dredge the river by removing 1 or more neutralized tiles and placing them back in the box at a cost of 2 energy cubes per tile. these cubes are removed from the game and must be taken from the villain’s fatigue zone. if there are not enough cubes in that zone, the villain can remove cubes from their spaces, then from their reserve zone. there is no limit to the number of neutralized tiles that can be removed from the river as long as the villain has enough energy cubes to do so. the miniatures of a tile thus removed cannot be brought back into play, even during reinforcement. demobilization demobilization is not an action and does not count as activating a tile. once per game, during their turn, the villain can demobilize an elite or henchman character tile. dredge the river of this tile as though it was neutralized and remove all the miniatures under its control from the board. equipment encumbrance your encumbrance total is the total of the encumbrance values of the equipment you are carrying, and determines your mp bonus. it cannot exceed your maximum encumbrance value. you can benefit from a skill only while your encumbrance total is lower than the encumbrance limit of the skill. picking up equipment picking up equipment is an automatic manipulation. you can only pick up equipment if it is in your area and your maximum encumbrance value is not exceeded when it is picked up. during the apply the automatic manipulation step, place the picked-up equipment next to your hero board. giving equipment giving equipment is an automatic manipulation. only the hero who gives the equipment spends an energy cube. to give equipment, the receiving hero must accept the equipment, both heroes must be in the same area, and the equipment must not cause the maximum encumbrance value of the hero receiving it to be exceeded. during the apply the automatic manipulation step, the hero receiving the equipment places it next to their hero board. taking equipment taking equipment is an automatic manipulation. only the hero receiving the equipment spends an energy cube. to take equipment, the hero carrying the equipment must agree to give it, both heroes must be in the same area, and the equipment must not cause the maximum encumbrance value of the hero taking it to be exceeded. during the apply the automatic manipulation step, the hero who takes the equipment card places it next to their hero board.throwing equipment throwing equipment is a complex manipulation. to perform this action, you must have los to the target area. during the declare a complex manipulation step, calculate the difficulty level of the throw: this is equal to the distance from your area to the target area. during the calculate the number of successes step, subtract the encumbrance value of the thrown equipment as well as any possible hindering index from the number of successes obtained. during the apply the complex manipulation step, compare the number of successes to the difficulty level of the throw: if the number of successes is equal to or higher than the difficulty level, place the equipment in the target area. if the number of successes is lower, place the equipment at a distance equal to the obtained number of successes, along the los towards the target area. dropping equipment dropping equipment is not an action and does not require any energy cubes to be spent. you can drop equipment at any time. place the card in your area. bat-gadget cards during mission setup, heroes with a utility belt can choose their bat-gadgets from all the bat-gadgets available in the game. the total of your bat-gadget sizes cannot exceed your utility belt’s size. a bat-gadget is not included in your encumbrance total value. you cannot pick up, give, take, throw or drop a bat-gadget. wounds when a hero is wounded, move the same number of energy cubes as wounds suffered into their wound zone. these are first taken from their fatigue zone, then from their spaces, and finally from their reserve zone. a hero is neutralized when all their energy cubes are in their wound zone. when a character with several life points is wounded, the cube used as the life point marker is moved down the same number of spaces in the command post as wounds suffered. if the cube reaches 0, the character is neutralized. when a character with only 1 life point is wounded, they are neutralized. neutralized heroes can no longer perform actions. they must choose a resting stance and their skills are no longer taken into account for this turn. neutralized characters are removed from the board and placed in the character pool. when all the characters of a tile have been removed from the board, the tile is neutralized. remove it, slide the remaining tiles to the left, then replace it neutralized side faceup at the end of the river on the right. other effects dissipation the triangular dissipation tokens have temporary effects then dissipate. during the trigger start of turn effects step of the side of the player who placed the token, if the token is active side faceup, it is turned facedown with the dissipating side visible; and if the token is dissipating side faceup, it is removed. explosion an explosion is an effect always associated with a level and a target area determined by a skill or a special rule. if the targeted area is not dangerous terrain, it becomes dangerous terrain whose level is equal to that of the explosion. if the targeted area is dangerous terrain, its level is increased by the level of the explosion. after having applied the wounds linked to the temporary increase of the total level of the dangerous terrain, the total level of dangerous terrain reverts to its initial value.game boards areas areas on the board are defined by these boundaries: white boundaries allow los and simple moves. orange boundaries allow los and simple moves. the two areas separated share los. special areas are indicated in the board rules, but are not marked. they allow los but prevent simple moves. walls are indicated in the board rules, but are not marked. they block los and prevent simple moves. two areas are adjacent if they are separated by a white or orange area boundary. an area’s level of elevation is indicated in the board rules. some areas have los markers to facilitate checking los.a promontory is a high area defined in the board rules that is accessible only be a special move and blocks los between 2 areas, regardless of their elevation level. however, los can begin or end on a promontory without being blocked. terrain difficult terrain is always associated with a level. calculate the total level of difficult terrain by adding together the different levels of difficult terrain in the area. some skills or special rules add levels of difficulty to terrain by using tokens. a miniature leaving a difficult terrain area must add the total level to the move cost. dangerous terrain can wound miniatures that enter it. calculate the total level of dangerous terrain by adding together the different levels of dangerous terrain in the area. some skills or special rules add levels of danger to terrain by using tokens. a miniature entering dangerous terrain area must roll a number of yellow dice equal to the total level and suffer a number of wounds equal to the number of successes. if terrain becomes dangerous, a miniature present in the area must immediately roll dice as above. if the total level of the dangerous terrain increases, a miniature present in the area must immediately roll the same number of yellow dice as the increase in level and suffer a number of wounds equal to the successes. over-occupation the total of the size indexes of the miniatures present in an area can never exceed the area’s occupation limit. check to see if an area is over-occupied by totalling the size indexes of all the miniatures in the area and adding the size index of the miniature wishing to move into the area. if this total is greater than the area’s occupation limit, the miniature over-occupies it. if a miniature must come into play in an area that it over-occupies, place it in an adjacent area that it does not over-occupy. if the adjacent areas are all over-occupied, the miniature does not come into play.

unit attacking an adjacent unit (or a unit with a missile weapon used at point blank range) is in melee. attacks beyond the range of adjacent hexes are ranged. count the hexes to the target (not counting the attacker’s hex but counting the target’s hex) and verify that the distance is within the weapon’s range. a unit adjacent to an enemy unit must engage it if it chooses to battle (it cannot target a more distant unit). the target of a ranged attack must be within line of sight (los). draw a line between the centres of the hexes; los is blocked if any part of a hex containing an obstruction or unit crosses this line. if the line runs along the edge of hexes it is only blocked if the obstructions stand somewhere along both sides of the line. terrain modifiers when present, terrain restrictions impose a cap on the default number of dice a unit attacking in or from the terrain type will roll. bonuses from lore or command cards etc are not subject to this limit. where effects combine, the lowest of the terrain maximums apply. hits and misses the number of battle dice rolled is determined by the color of the unit’s banner. the attacker scores 1 hit for each colored helmet symbol rolled that matches the banner color of the target unit. unless specified otherwise, the sword on shield (bonus strike) symbol and the lore symbol are misses. for each hit scored remove a figure from the target unit. the banner bearer is removed last and placed on the attacker’s victory track. when playing lore adventures, take 1 lore token for each lore symbol rolled (even when battling back) if the rolled lore does not trigger some other effect. retreats for each retreat flag counted against it, the target unit must move 1 movement (typically 1 or 2 hexes) back towards its own side of the battlefield. terrain has no effect on retreat moves, though impassable terrain is still impassable. if a unit’s retreat path is blocked, one figure is removed for each retreat hex of movement that cannot be completed.morale morale values can ‘stack’ (eg. supported dwarves on a rampart adjacent to a stronghold = bold 4) and are not mutually exclusive. bold a bold unit may ignore a flag rolled against it in battle for each level of bold that it has (but is never forced to do so). a bold unit may battle back when attacked in melee and not forced to vacate its hex as soon as the attacker’s dice roll is fully resolved. there are no further battle back actions, and units that battle back are never entitled to gain ground, make pursuit actions or bonus melee attacks. frightened a frightened unit retreats 2 hexes for each flag rolled against it. a frightened unit must also check for panic losses when retreating: roll 1d for each hex of retreat ground actually covered. any dice that match the retreating unit’s banner color kill a figure of that unit (all other results are ignored). support a unit adjacent to at least 2 friendly units receives support, and is considered bold. it may not battle back if forced out of its initial supported position. follow-on actions gain ground an attacker that forces a defending unit to vacate its hex may gain ground and move into the just-vacated hex. pursuit if the successful melee attacker is a mounted unit, it may pursue by gaining ground and then moving 1 additional hex. if the unit just moves into the vacated hex, or then moves back into its original hex, it is still considered a pursuit. the unit may then make an optional bonus melee attack against the same or any other target adjacent to it. if this attack is successful and eliminates or pushes back the target, the attacker may then gain ground, but cannot make another pursuit or bonus melee attack. follow-on actions are never mandatory and are subject to normal terrain restrictions. defending units allowed to battle before an attacking unit (due to magic or a special action) may not gain ground or pursue. draw and end of turn discard the command card played this turn and draw another. if playing a lore adventure, choose one of the following actions: draw 2 lore cards, keep one and discard the other or draw 1 lore card and take 1 lore token or take 2 lore tokens players alternate turns until one player reaches the required number of victory banners, at which time the game immediately ends.lore lore tokens power spells and legendary actions. there is no limit to the number that can be stored, but players are limited by the number in the supply. a lore card must be played during the phase specified. reaction lore cards (light background), can be played during your opponent’s turn or in reaction to one of his actions or lore card play. spend the required number of lore tokens, choose a target, resolve the effects and discard the card. only 1 lore card can be played during a player’s turn and 1 during his opponent’s turn. anytime an odd value is halved, round the result up. you may never have a number of lore cards more than your highest lore master level +1. if you have more, discard either from the card(s) just picked or your existing hand. lore cards can be played out of character if the corresponding lore master is not on your council, by paying an additional 3 lore. level-dependent lore cards played in this way are cast at level 1. battle savvy troops a battle savvy unit attacked in melee combat and not eliminated or forced to retreat may battle back. a retreating battle savvy unit may never battle back. when a battle savvy unit in melee is unable to fulfill a retreat move, the unit may battle back (after it takes losses and if it is still in its original hex). battle savvy units with ranged weapons do not collect lore tokens in ranged combat, but do collect lore tokens in melee combat. war councils if playing a lore adventure, each player receives a war council sheet. the commander level dictates the number of command cards you hold during the game. your highest level lore master (cleric, wizard, warrrior or rogue) determines your starting hand of lore cards, initial reserve of lore tokens and maximum number of lore cards. place lore master tokens on the spots matching your lore masters, either as detailed in the adventure or as chosen by the players (usually 6 levels total each, with levels secretly assigned among the council members). an appropriate lore master token is placed face up on a space, with 0-2 tokens (generic face up) under it to indicate his level of 1-3. sort the lore cards by lore master class and shuffle each of the 4 decks separately. for each lore master class (cleric, wizard, warrrior or rogue) present in both sides’ war councils, randomly take 14 cards from that class deck. for each class present on only one council, take 8 cards. for each class on neither council, take 5 cards. shuffle all of these cards together to form the game’s lore deck and deal 4 to each side; players choose the number they will keep according to the player’s highest lore master level.landmarks when lore master landmark rules are in effect, a player with a 3rd level lore master (cleric, wizard, warrrior or rogue) receives the corresponding lore master’s landmark. if both players have a lore master of that class neither receives it. at setup, starting with the player moving first in the adventure, place the landmark on an empty hex on the 3rd or 4th row of hexes from the controlling player’s side. a player with a 3rd level commander must place a stronghold landmark in a countryside hex occupied by one of his units at the start of the adventure. both sides may deploy a stronghold. a landmark’s special effects only benefit the controlling player’s units, but these common rules apply to both side’s units: a unit occupying a landmark is bold. a unit entering a landmark must stop, may move no further that turn and may not battle that turn. it battles with a maximum of 2d. a unit attacking a unit on a landmark hex battles with a maximum of 2d. a landmark blocks los. creature lairs at setup, starting with the player moving first in the adventure, place a lair on an empty hex on the 3rd or 4th row of hexes from the controlling player’s side. creatures a single creature figure is considered a unit for game purposes, but is neither a foot nor a mounted unit. when playing a section card you may order a creature in a different section by paying 3 lore tokens. creatures are eliminated only on a critical hit. when a creature takes one or more hits from any source, roll only these dice again. if the creature’s banner color is then rolled (ignore all other symbols), it receives a critical hit and is killed. the victor places it on his victory track and receives 1 lore token (see below). creatures are bold, but must always ignore 1 flag rolled against them, rather than retreating instead. creatures provide support but never benefit from it, and do not receive a morale boost from landmarks. retreat and trampling for each retreat flag a creature must resolve, it must retreat 2 hexes (unless otherwise stated). if it cannot do so it receives 1 hit for each hex of retreat movement it cannot take. as usual, make a critical hit check if necessary. when 2 units, or a unit and obstacle, block a creature’s retreat, each unit in its path may be trampled. make a critical hit check; if it survives, it remains in the hex and each unit in its retreat path takes 1 hit. special powers and power-ups most creatures have special powers or unique attacks. a soon as the creature meets the necessary lore requirement for a power upon seeing the results of a dice roll, it must unleash it. lore rolled by a creature may never be held or stored.dragons flight the last hex of movement must be an empty hex (it is then considered to be on the ground). when used against a flying dragon, lore cards that hold or web cause it to fall to the ground and take a 1d critical hit check, and the creature stops in its current space (if the space is occupied, it must retreat until it reaches an empty hex). morale a dragon may ignore 1 flag. when forced to retreat, it must retreat 3 hexes, and flies over any units in its retreat path. the last hex must be an empty hex. if a retreat cannot be completed, 1 hit is scored for each hex of the retreat that cannot be completed. after 2 or more hits, a critical hit check occurs. critical hits a dragon only takes a critical hit check any time it suffers 2 or more hits. the first 2 hits scored on a dragon cause a 1d critical hit check, and each additional hit adds 1d to the critical hit check. the dragon dies immediately if its banner color is rolled on the critical hit check. ignore all other results. a dragon counts as 2 victory banners. combat to use a breath attack, spend lore prior to movement equal to the lore cost. the dragon may then attack a maximum of 3 enemy hexes during movement. a breath weapon may only be used when flying above an enemy unit, and only on any given unit once during a turn. place an appropriate breath token (target side) in the enemy unit’s hex. after all of your movement is completed, resolve all of your breath attacks (prior to any other combat). roll the dragon’s damage dice against each enemy unit with a breath token. lore symbols activate the dragon’s special effect (flip the breath token over to the effect side). if more than 1 lore is rolled, place additional tokens, effect side up, in the unit’s hex. if no lore is rolled, the token is removed. terrain combat restrictions do not apply to a breath attack, and lore rolled is never taken. a breath effect token stays with a unit until the unit is eliminated or the token is removed. to remove a token, the unit’s player must order the unit and spend 2 lore per token; it may then move and battle as normal on that turn. hydras the hydra does not have to suffer a critical hit in order to be wounded. instead, for each hit choose one neck piece attached to the hydra to remove from the game. when rolling battle dice for the hydra, you may use lore to place a neck piece with 3 heads into an empty neck slot (otherwise, the lore is lost). defeating a creature a troop that defeats a creature or dragon has 1 lore token placed its hex. the troop may spend the token to do one of the following: – move one additional hex when moving or in a retreat – battle with one additional die – ignore one flag"

once it has 3, it is removed from the battlefield. defending all units can defend themselves against an attack by rolling a number of combat dice equal to their combat value. each separate attack can be defended against. each shield that the defender rolls cancels out one of the skulls rolled by the attacker. any unit (including the one standing on the ditch) that attacks another across a ditch rolls 1 combat die less, and the defending unit rolls 1 combat die more. this does not apply to attacks by archers and crossbowmen. archers and crossbowmen archers and crossbowmen may only move or attack, not both. they may attack any unit within their range: 2 spaces for archers and 3 spaces for crossbowmen. roll combat dice as normal; units may defend themselves as normal. charge cards when one of these cards is drawn, the unit(s) shown move as normal, but they may roll 1 extra combat dice for any attack they make that turn. the mighty cannon when a mighty cannon battle card is turned over, the imperial army player may either move the cannon 1 space or fire it. the cannon defends against attack as normal, rolling 2 combat dice in defence. to fire, choose a target and mark the target by placing the target tile on it. if it is a space adjacent to the cannon, the target is automatically destroyed. if it is further afield, shuffle the 10 cannon tiles and turn them over one at a time, placing them faceup in the next adjacent space of your choice (as long as each tile keeps heading in the direction of the target). flying cannon ball: no effect, continue placing tiles. bouncing cannon ball: any unit in the space is dealt 1 skull token. continue placing tiles. explosion: any unit in the space is destroyed. no more tiles can be placed. there is no effect in an empty space. if the imperial player successfully lays a path of tiles to the target, the target tile is flipped to reveal an explosion: the target unit is removed from the battlefield. if an explosion tile is placed before reaching the target, the attempt has failed. after resolving the attack, remove all the cannon tiles from the battlefield. exploding cannon if the first cannon tile turned over is an explosion, eliminate any unit in the space, then shuffle the remaining tiles, draw one, and place it into the space with the cannon. if it is a bouncing ball, the cannon receives 1 skull token. if it is a flying ball, nothing happens. if it is an explosion, the cannon is destroyed and removed from the battlefield. in any case, the cannon’s turn is over. the ogre champion when an ogre battle card is turned over, draw ogre champion cards one at a time. when a move card is drawn, he may move 1 space; when an attack card is drawn, he may attack an opponent in an adjacent space. he attacks and defends as normal. when the last ogre champion card has been drawn, the next battle card can be drawn from the deck. for every skull token the ogre gets, he draws 1 less ogre champion card. once he has 6 tokens, he is removed from the battlefield. the tower a unit that moves into the tower space is placed on top of the tower. only standard infantry units (5 miniatures) may occupy the tower. the first player to reach the tower may take possession of it. the imperial player may only take the tower with men-at-arms, crossbowmen, and archers. the chaos player may only take the tower with chaos warriors, chaos bowmen, orcs, goblins and beastmen. units inside the tower may roll 1 extra combat die when attacking or defending. all units that attack units inside the tower roll 1 less combat die than normal.you must eliminate the unit inside the tower to take possession of it; only one unit may occupy the tower. cannon tiles affect units inside the tower as normal. however, any explosion hit on a unit in the tower damages the tower as well. each time it is hit by a explosion, it receives 1 rubble token. when it is hit for a third time, it is removed from the game. the tower is not damaged by a bouncing ball tile. the battle scenarios the scenarios are played using the normal rules, and may be played in any order. play the scenarios in sequence for a campaign. after playing each scenario, the winner is awarded a number of campaign points. at the end of the campaign, the player with the most points is the overall winner. when fighting a campaign, any unit that survives a battle becomes an elite unit and is awarded an elite unit token (place the token in the slot in the unit’s base). an elite unit which survives a second battle does not get a second token. elite units roll 1 extra combat die when attacking and defending. adding reinforcements before deploying forces, both players agree on the maximum number of points they will use to make up each army. player assemble their armies using the point values given. the two armies don’t have to have exactly the same total points value, but they should be as close as possible. imperial army point values men-at-arms 4 crossbowmen 5 archers 6 imperial knights 8 lord knights 9 mighty cannon 10 reinforcements imperial lord 8 chaos army point values goblins 4 beastmen 4 chaos bowmen 4 orcs 5 chaos warriors 5 wold riders 5 ogre champion 8 champions of chaos 9 reinforcements chaos lord 8"

faction’s screen, and an energy board and faction marker. for a team game, teammates sit together facing their opponents. teammates play the game separately but can discuss strategy and show each other their tactic cards. they may pass any number of tactic cards to each other during their energy phases. ships, ship cards and tactic cards there are 2 methods of gathering ships, ship cards and tactic cards. some missions may combine these methods. mission selected: the mission tells you exactly which ships and cards to use. player selected: the mission gives you a fleet cost; the combined launch cost of all the ships in your fleet cannot exceed this. you may have only 1 copy of any ship card in your fleet; and you can never have multiple ships with the same name (even different versions). if you have multiple copies of the game, you and your opponent may have the same named ship. you may have a number of tactic cards equal to half the fleet cost (rounded down). you may have up to 3 copies of the same card in your deck. starting the g ame each player places his energy marker on spot 15 of his energy board, then draws 5 tactic cards from his deck. look at your cards but keep them secret from your opponent. roll the number die (re-roll ties). the high roller chooses who goes first; play passes clockwise from the starting player. the first player gains only 5 energy on his first energy phase instead of the normal 10). game round your turn consists of 3 phases. once your turn is complete the player to your left has his turn. at any point during your turn, you can discard any number of tactic cards from your hand. you gain 1 energy for each card discarded this way. 1. energy phase at the start of your energy phase, gain 10 energy, then draw 1 tactic card and add it to your hand. your energy can never go below 0 or exceed 40. 2. deploy phase pay the launch cost in energy to launch any number of ship cards that haven’t yet been launched, as long as you have enough energy and enough available spaces. if a ship card is behind your screen, pay the launch cost to place the card in front of you and place its ship(s) onto any spaces in your starting zone. you must position a ship’s base to cover at least 1 full starting zone space. when launching a squadron, you must place them adjacent to at least 1 other ship in that squadron, as well as each base covering at least 1 full starting zone space. a ship may be able to transport other ships. if a ship launched on a previous turn is transporting ships, you can pay the transported ship(s) launch cost to launch them adjacent to the ship that was transporting them. a squadron’s ships must also be placed adjacent to at least 1 other ship in that squadron. when you launch a ship, place a number of blue shield pegs on its base equal to its shield number. each ship in a squadron gains that many shield pegs. if there are not enough spaces to place a ship, or all ships in a squadron, you cannot launch the ship(s). transporting ships and capacity a ship may never transport more spaces worth of ships than its capacity number. a ship or squadron takes up space equal to the number of spaces the ship(s) cover when they are placed on the board. a ship can only transport ships smaller than itself. if you are transporting a squadron, you must be able to transport the entire squadron. a ship that is being transported cannot itself transport ships. when launching a ship into your starting zone that is transporting other ships, secretly place their ship cards under the launching ship’s ship card. they remain hidden until they are launched or destroyed. you do not pay their launch cost until they are launched out of the transporting ship. if a ship transporting other ships is taken over or destroyed, all of the ships it is transporting are immediately destroyed.3. action phase you may activate as many ship cards you can afford to pay for in energy, one at a time. you cannot activate the same ship card more than once per turn. 1. choose a ship card and pay the activation cost choose a ship card to activate and pay its activation cost . 2. move the ship(s) on your chosen ship card move any or all of the ships on your chosen ship card. a ship may move in any direction up to its move number. squadron ships are moved in any order, one at a time. choose to lead with the front or back end of a medium ship, then move it so the trailing end follows the spaces he leading end just left. any movement onto 3 new spaces in any direction counts as 1 space for a large ship. a ship can pass through spaces occupied by other ships, but if the space is occupied by an opponent, it may take damage when it initially moves adjacent. a ship cannot end its movement on any space occupied by another ship. a ship cannot be placed onto a half hex, or be moved through or into one. electronic countermeasure (ecm) damage if your ship moves onto or through a space that would put it adjacent to an enemy ship, it may take damage as it passes. your opponent may roll the number die: on a 5+, the move ship takes direct damage as follows: – if it moved adjacent to a small ship, it takes 1 direct ecm damage. – if it moved adjacent to a medium ship, it takes 2 direct ecm damage. – if it moved adjacent to a large ship, it takes 3 direct ecm damage. ships launched adjacent to an opponent’s ship, or those ‘placed’ onto an adjacent space due to some effect, do not take ecm damage. a ship can take multiple ecm damage as it moves, but only as it moves adjacent to each ship. the spaces it moves in without leaving adjacency do not cause additional damage. 3. attack with the ship(s) on your chosen ship card attack with the primary weapon, and secondary/additional weapons if appropriate.attacking charging to attack with a weapon, you must charge it. pay the charge cost (normally 0) in energy in order to attack a number of times up to its attacks number. you must finish attacking with one weapon before charging the next. you may attack different targets with each attack, unless otherwise noted. you can charge a weapon only once per ship’s activation, unless otherwise noted. all ships in a squadron attack separately with all weapons on or attached to their ship card. all the ships must pay their charge costs separately. targeting a targeted ship must be within the attacking ship’s weapon range in spaces. you can attack through any ships (count the occupied spaces). attacking check weapon’s attacks number: this is the maximum number of times the ship can attack with that weapon during that charge. announce your target: declare which of your ships is the attacker, and which ship it is targeting. you may target different ships with the same weapon if you have multiple attacks, or a ship becomes un-targetable. check weapon’s strength: the amount of damage the weapon inflicts when it hits. roll coordinate dice: roll both dice then call out your roll. your opponent checks the coordinate on the target’s ship card, and announces whether it’s a hit (gray box) or a miss (white box). if a ship is hit, deal damage. if the ship is hit on a critical damage box (red star) while its shields are down, it is immediately destroyed (if the damage caused when you hit critical damage brings the shields down, the ship is not destroyed). damage if your attack hits, remove shield pegs equal to the weapon’s strength number from the target ship. once shield pegs are gone, add hull damage pegs instead. a ship’s shields are up if it has blue pegs on its base, and down if it has none. direct damage direct damage dealt by some tactic cards and powers are not considered attacks. direct damage: applied like normal damage; remove shield pegs and add hull damage pegs as normal. direct shield damage: applied only to shields. if a ship’s shields are done, no damage is applied. do not add hull damage pegs if the damage goes over the available number of shield pegs. direct hull damage: applied as hull damage pegs, even if the ship’s shields are up. a ship may be destroyed in this manner even while its shields are up. specific types: unless otherwise noted, treat specific types of damage as generic shield, hull, or direct damage.tactic cards you have a tactic card hand limit of 10 cards . if drawing a card would put you over this limit, discard a card before drawing (you still gain 1 energy for the discarded card). if you draw the last card in your tactic deck, immediately shuffle the discards and create a new facedown deck. do not create a new deck if you go through it a second time—you can no longer draw tactic cards for the rest of the game. if you are the last player to go through your deck a second time, the game immediately ends. you can always replace an additional weapon, hero, or ship upgrade card on a ship card. you must pay the full energy cost to attach the new card, then choose an existing attached card of the same type and discard it. when you take control of an opponent’s ship due to a card or power, you take control of the ship card, all attached cards, and all ships that card represents. any ships it is transporting are immediately destroyed. if the ship has a hero attached that is already in your fleet, you must choose one to discard. events: normally a one time effect then discarded. hero: may be attached to a solo ship card you control. you cannot have 2 heroes with the same name attached to ships in your fleet at the same time. solo/squadron ship upgrade: may be attached to a solo or squadron ship you control, depending on whether it has a solo or squadron icon on it. solo/squadron additional weapon: may be attached to a solo or squadron ship you control, depending on whether it has a solo or squadron icon on it. any time you activate that ship card, you may charge this weapon along with any of the card’s other weapons, in any order. solo/squadron sabotage: may be attached to a solo or squadron ship your opponent controls, depending on whether it has a solo or squadron icon on it. there is no limit to the number of sabotage cards a ship may have on it. it is permanently attached unless it is removed by another card or power or the ship is destroyed. mission prepped cards when a mission lists a card as prepped, it is placed aside at the start of the game, and is not part of your tactic deck total. they do however subtract from the total number of that card you can have in your deck. obstacles and discoveries unless otherwise stated, obstacles and discoveries are stationery. if they can move, treat them as double space ships. obstacles obstacles are placed faceup on the battlefield at the start of the game. debris field: if a ship moves onto a debris field, roll the number die. on a 1-6, it takes 1 direct debris damage; on a 7 or higher, no damage. a ship takes damage from a debris field only when it moves onto it, not if it is launched or placed onto it. a ship does not take additional damage if it stays on the field or moves onto the second space of the field.asteroids: when a small or medium ship next to an asteroid field is hit by an attack, roll the number die. on a 6+, the attack misses. ships cannot move through or be placed onto an asteroid field space, however you can target an enemy through such a space. discovery tiles discovery tiles are placed power-side up or black-side up, depending on the mission. when a ship ends its movement on a black-side up tile, the tile is turned power-side up and its powers take effect immediately. when a ship ends its movement on a power-side tile, its powers take effect immediately. ships can move over and attack through discovery tiles. alien artifact: while a ship is on an alien artifact, add 7 to its primary weapon range. energy source: if one or more ships you control are on energy sources at the start of your energy phase, gain 2 additional energy. observation station: if one or more ships you control are on an observation station, all ships you control add 2 to the range of their primary weapon. orbital market: if one or more ships you control are on an orbital market at the start of your energy phase, you may draw 1 additional tactic card. shield regenerator: if a ship you control is on a shield regenerator at the start of your energy phase, you may add 1 shield peg to that ship (you cannot raise its shields above their starting value). warp gate: when a small or medium ship you control begins its activation on a warp gate, instead of moving that ship during its activation, you may choose an empty space that is within 14 spaces of that gate, and place the base of the activated ship on that space. a medium ship must be placed so that both sides of the base are on empty spaces. winning the g ame victory conditions each mission has specific victory conditions. if the conditions state destroy all your opponent’s ships, after the second round of play, victory is achieved when your opponent has no ships left on the battlefield. victory cannot be achieved before the third round of play. running out of tactic cards if all player’s tactic card decks run out twice, the game immediately ends when the last player draws his final card. all players total the launch costs of ships still in play (excluding transported ships and those that have not yet been launched). score full costs for squadron cards if all of their ships are on the battlefield, and divide the cost for partial squadrons. the player with the highest total launch cost wins. on a tie, the player with the most ships on the battlefield wins, then the player whose deck ran out for the second time first."
33,156858,BLACK ORCHESTRA,2017,GAME SALUTE,2.4061,165,"setup place hitler and the 5 deputy tiles on their starting spaces. randomly shuffle the item tiles and place one facedown on every black square space on the board. select a difficulty level and place the red military support marker on the appropriate value (2 for easy, 3 for standard, 4 for hard). then place the corresponding difficulty tile over the part of the track listed on the back of the tile. shuffle the event cards into their respective stages and place each stack along the top of the game board, ordered 1 to 7. remove 2 cards from each deck from the game without looking at them. place the conspirator deck, interrogation deck, and dice beside the board. each player chooses, or is randomly dealt, 1 conspirator board (2 if playing solo), plus a pawn and 2 marker cubes in a matching color. place one of your cubes on each of the marked starting levels for motivation (timid) and suspicion (medium). players place their pawns on the train station space in berlin . 1. hitler and deputy penalties if you begin your turn in the same space as hitler and/or any of his 5 deputies, suffer the listed penalty: hitler decrease your motivation by 1. hess choose and discard a card from your dossier. goebbels you cannot use your special ability this turn. bormann you cannot take a conspire action this turn. himmler raise your suspicion by 1. goering choose and discard one of your items. 2. take up to 3 actions you may take any combination of 3 actions. all actions except conspire can be taken multiple times. action you may resolve 1 effect on your conspirator sheet or on a card in your dossier preceded by the symbol. a effect does not require an action to resolve and can be resolved at any time, even on another player’s turn. collect item take a revealed item tile in your space and add it to your conspirator sheet, observing item limits. conspire you can only take this action once during your turn. take up to 3 dice, spending 1 action for each die taken. roll all of those dice and resolve the results in this order: 1 for each , you and all other conspirators in your space raise suspicion by 1. 2 for each , place that die on the dissent track. 3 total all the number results: you may perform up to that number of actions this turn. dissent track once 3 dice are on the dissent track, the active player immediately chooses and applies either of these effects: • choose 1 conspirator to increase their motivation by 1. • decrease hitler’s military support by 1 (cannot go below its starting level). return all dice on the track to the supply. now add any additional ‘overflow’ results rolled to the now-cleared track. deliver item some board spaces are marked with items that can be delivered there. once a facedown item has been removed from a board space, you can deliver to that space. discard the appropriate item(s) from your conspirator sheet and gain the listed benefit. if the benefit as listed as distributed, players may distribute the benefits among themselves however they choose, regardless of location. dossier draw 1 card from the conspirator deck and add it to your dossier faceup, observing card limits. cards marked with this symbol are illegal. move you can move from one space to a space connected to it by a white dotted line. you may only enter areas of the map with a stage number equal to or less than the current stage’s number. however, once stage 7 begins, some previously available spaces become off-limits for the rest of the game. when you enter a space with modifiers, immediately apply the listed modifiers and continue your turn. applying the effects does not count as an action. you can gain the effects of a space multiple times in a turn, but you must move off the space and then move back on it to gain the effect again. fortified locations serve as required elements for some plots. otherwise, they have no game effect. release if you are at extreme suspicion, you cannot perform this action. attempt to use your influence and order another conspirator to be released from prison. you must be in the gestapo hq space and not at extreme suspicion. roll 1 die. on a result of , you are arrested. on any other result, raise your suspicion by 1 and choose one arrested conspirator to release. the released conspirator moves to gestapo hq at high suspicion.reveal item flip an unrevealed item tile in your space faceup. transfer give or take 1 card or item from another conspirator in the same space, observing card and item limits. 3. draw an event card draw the top card from the lowest numbered (left-most) event deck available and place it faceup in the current event space, resolving its effects immediately. if you can’t draw an event card when required, the players lose the game. when there are no more cards in a stage, move on to the next numbered stage. the card showing on top of the current event space (the last event that was resolved) is the current event. the current event tells you the number of the current event stage. a new stage begins after the first card of that new stage has been drawn, not when the previous stage’s deck runs out. once stage 7 begins, many previously available spaces are now off-limits for the rest of the game: move hitler, deputies, and conspirators to the nearest legal space. key events each stage’s deck has 1 key event (some may have been randomly removed during setup). when a key event is drawn, place it faceup in the current event space as normal. when the next event card is drawn, shift the key event card to the right and place it faceup on the key event space to the right of the board (it isn’t considered active). if a key event is in play and an important event (yellow top) is drawn, remove it from the game without effect and draw a new event card to replace it. if there is no key event in play and an important event is drawn, resolve the event as usual. key events are discarded when the next stage begins. after resolving an event card, your turn is over. if an effect would have you draw multiple event cards in a turn, completely resolve the first event card before drawing the next. the player to your left is now the active player and begins their turn. berlin all b berlin spaces (including the train station ) are considered to be stage 1 spaces and adjacent to one another. they all count as berlin for the purposes of card effects; however each space is not considered the same space for transfers, plot stipulations, etc. conspirators still need to be in the same space to fulfill those conditions. you can only enter or leave a berlin space from a non- berlin space by going through the train station .hitler and deputy movement when hitler or a deputy move, they must end the move in a different location than they started from, regardless of any conspirator(s) in the space they started from. motivation your conspirator sheet lists the benefit gained while at each level of motivation, and you also retain the benefits of any lower level. dossiers and items the area below your board where you place conspirator cards is your dossier. conspirator cards are never held in hand or played outside of the dossier. if you ever exceed your item or dossier limit, immediately discard down to that limit. you may still get cards and items, but you must discard down to your limit immediately afterwards. players can carry up to 3 items (3, 4 or 5 player game) or 4 items (1 or 2 player game). the maximum number of cards you can have in your dossier is 6 (1-2 players), 5 (3-4 players) or 4 (5 players). however if you are at timid motivation, your dossier limit is 2 cards. gestapo raids when a gestapo raid event card is drawn, each conspirator performs the following steps in order: 1 if you are at extreme suspicion, you are arrested. arrested conspirators discard all illegal cards in their dossier. if all players are in prison at the same time, the players lose the game. 2 for each illegal card in your dossier, you must choose to either discard it, or keep it and raise your suspicion by 1. resolve one card at a time in any order you choose. if you reach extreme suspicion during this step, keep any remaining illegal cards. 3 the active player removes all dice on the dissent track. arrest and prison when you are arrested, immediately move to the prison space and discard all illegal cards in your dossier. the prison is not adjacent to any other location and is not a valid location for any sort of movement or card effect unless the effect specifically states that you are released. the only way to get into or out of prison is to be arrested or released. prison restrictions you cannot resolve effects from cards in your dossier or character sheet, including effects. you can’t be the target of, and are unaffected by, all card effects, including event and interrogation cards. your special ability is considered blank, even if you are at a high enough motivation to use it. you retain all of your items and non-illegal conspirator cards in your dossier when arrested, but you cannot discard, resolve, or transfer them.arrested player’s turn if you start your turn in prison, follow this turn sequence instead of following the usual turn structure: 1 draw an interrogation card. 2 draw an event card. interrogation cards when you draw an interrogation card, secretly read it and choose one of the options. you cannot reveal or discuss the options with other players at any time. unlike resolving other effects, if you can’t fully apply all the effect(s) of an option, you must choose a different option. you may always choose the try and resist option. when applying the result of the roll, resolve as much of the effect as you can and disregard the rest of the text. once you’ve chosen which option to resolve, read it aloud and apply its effects, but do not reveal the other options. you choose the target for all effects. conspirators in jail (including you) cannot be the target of any card effect, including interrogation cards. you are only released from prison when a card effect specifically says so. after resolving the interrogation card, shuffle it back into the deck unless the card instructs otherwise. plots to win the game, you need to successfully attempt one of the plot cards from the conspirator deck: preparations first confirm that you meet all the required elements listed on the left side of the plot card. you must be at committed or reckless motivation to attempt a plot, and some plots can only be attempted with reckless motivation. if all the required elements are met, you can use the act action and resolve the attempt one plot in your dossier effect listed on the committed line of your conspirator sheet. 1. build the dice pool your dice pool always starts with 1 die gained by meeting the required elements to attempt a plot. the right side of the plot card lists optional elements that help by either by adding dice to the dice pool ( ) or by removing results. there are 3 types: items you may discard any of the items listed for their associated benefit. unless otherwise specified, each benefit can only be gained once. you can also discard items carried by other conspirators in your space (with their permission). affiliation if your affiliation (abwehr, civilian, or wehrmacht ) matches the affiliation on the plot, you gain the associated benefit. unlike items, you cannot use the affiliations of other conspirators in your space. meeting optional elements based on other conspirators in your space that allow you to add one or more to the dice pool.some conspirator cards and abilities can also add benefits to the dice pool. 2. determine difficulty determine the final difficulty of the plot attempt by noting the current level of hitler’s military support as well as the active player’s suspicion. check the current event and all cards in dossiers to find any other modifiers. announce the number of needed to succeed as well as the number of that would result in failure. you may now choose to remove any amount of dice from the dice pool. finally, roll all dice in the final dice pool simultaneously. 3. success or failure? check for suspicious activity: if the number of equals or exceeds the amount of dice shown below your current suspicion, the plot attempt immediately fails. all other dice results are ignored, even if it would result in a successful plot attempt. discard the attempted plot card and move hitler to the chancellery . all conspirators lower their motivation by 1, and the conspirator who attempted the plot is arrested. was the attempt successful? if the number of is lower than the dice shown on your conspirator sheet under your current suspicion, your plot was not detected. count the number of and compare it to hitler’s military support. if the number rolled was lower than hitler’s military support, the plot has failed. however, the plot was not detected and you were able to escape. do not discard the attempted plot card and continue your turn as normal. victory! you win the game if you assassinate hitler by attempting a plot and rolling a total number of on the dice equal to or exceeding the current level of hitler’s military support – while rolling under the allowed by the suspicion of the conspirator attempting the plot. defeat... the players lose the game if: • ail players are in prison. • the documents located event card is drawn. • you can’t draw an event card when you are required to. game variants trusted lieutenants deputies can be killed with plot cards in the same way hitler can. the difficulty for deputies is always 2 . to win, you must not only eliminate hitler, you must eliminate at least 2 of his deputies as well. sense of urgency during setup, discard an additional card from each event deck. guarded documents if you prefer not to play with the documents located card, return it to the box and only discard 1 card from the stage 7 event deck during setup."
34,235,BLACKBEARD,2008,GMT GAMES,3.205,161,"objective the winner is the player with the most victory points at game end. vps are scored immediately after they occur, and are earned from: the net worth of a retired pirate. obtained by in-port conversion of booty (doubloons) taken after looting merchant ships or successfully attacking ports. the notoriety of retired, eliminated and surviving pirates. obtained by: - looting merchant ships - torturing hostages - successful port attack - successful port sack - defeating a king’s commissioner in battle - defeating a warship in battle - surviving an oust attempt by a king’s commissioner vps are also scored for being eliminated by a king’s commissioner (pp), using a king’s commissioner to eliminate a pirate (app), being defeated by a pirate after attacking with a king’s commissioner, or using a warship to damage a pirate. if a pirate is eliminated (not by a kc) or is still alive at game end, he receives 1 vp per notoriety point, but receives 0 vp for net worth. setup players take the following number of pirate displays each: 5 or 4 players: 2; 3 players: 3; 2 players: 4. roll 1d6. the highest roller is player a; play passes clockwise. players take corresponding pirate id chits. remove play immediately cards from the event deck. shuffle the deck and deal 4 cards face down to each player. re-shuffle the play immediately cards back in and place the deck face down on the board. place the 8 pro-pirate governors in port boxes determined by d66 rolls. if pirate ports or duplicate ports are rolled, use the next available higher-numbered port. players randomly draw or choose the following number of pirate cards each: 5 or 4 players: 2; 3 players: 3; 2 players: 4. in player order, deploy 1 pirate into any sea area (even if occupied). in order, additional pirates may be deployed if desired, 1 at a time, up to the total number held. place each pirate id marker and pirate card on a pirate display and select a ship type (sloop or schooner) for each pirate deployed. place combat and speed markers on the card as appropriate for that ship, and loyalty level markers on 7. place the 35 merchant ships in a cup and draw 8. place face down in merchant boxes (ship icon) at ports determined by d66 rolls. if pirate ports or duplicate ports are rolled, use the next available higher-numbered port. place the victory point markers for all players in the 0 box of the track (+100 side down). place the following markers in cups: 9 king’s commissioners (kc), 15 hostages, 16 anti-pirate governors and 15 warships. determine game length. standard: until the general pardon card is played for the third time (2-3 hours); or long: go through the event deck twice, adding general pardon after the first run through (4-5 hours). sequence of play each player, in player order, takes a player turn as a pirate player (pp), at some time which each of the other players, as anti-pirates (ap), get 1 anti-pirate turn.on your turn as a pirate: a ship with scurvy has its crew loyalty reduced by 1. 1. event card draw phase the pp draws event cards, one at at time, until he has 4. resolve, then discard, any play immediately cards and draw replacements. 2. merchant ship phase if there are fewer than 5 merchants, increase the number to 6 by adding face-down merchants to ports using d66 rolls. if pirate ports, duplicate ports or destroyed ports are rolled, use the next available higher-numbered port. 3. event card announcement phase the pp plays at least 1 event card as an event or for actions. all 4 cards in a pp’s hand may be played, but only 1 can be used for actions. when played as an event, the event is resolved and the other players cannot take any anti-pirate actions. when played for actions, the number of actions the player may undertake is shown on the card. each action is completed before starting the next. when the card can be played for event and actions, the event may be played for itself (other players cannot take any anti-pirate actions), or in addition to the actions. any action may be repeated in the same turn. actions may be split amongst all the player’s pirates. event cards with a diamond icon give one pirate only a number of actions equal to his initiative rating. if he is eliminated before using them all, any of the player’s other pirates may use the remaining actions. if a player has no cards to determine how many actions he may take, he may have up to 2 actions for up to 2 cards discarded (1 action per card). 4. actions phase (if a card was played for actions) each action allows one of the player’s pirates to perform one of the following: 1. move 1 pirate 7. sack port 2. find merchant ship 8. booty grab 3. loot merchant ship 9. d&r recovery 4. convert merchant ship 10. form pirate alliance 5. in-port activities 11. retire voluntarily 6. attack port 12. draw and/or deploy new pirate the only actions available to a pirate ship with a d&r marker are movement and d&r recovery. if a ship with a d&r marker is attacked in any way, subtract -2 from its speed and combat. on your turn as an anti-pirate: no ap action can be played more than once during any single pirate action. ap players may not work together or reveal their cards. no ap action is allowed if the pp is drawing or deploying a new pirate. ap players can use their kcs to react (intercept and attack) to some pirate actions during the pirate’s turn, but only 1 kc can react per action. anti-pirate actions: 1. attempt to deploy a king’s commissioner (kc) 2. use a king’s commissioner (kc) 3. use any on-station warship or play warship sighting event card 4. play an anti-pirate event cardpp action 1: move the player may move 1 of his pirates as follows. these rules apply to moving kcs as well. any number of pirates are allowed in any sea area, transit box, or port. if a pirate ship’s speed is reduced below 0, it requires 2 move actions simultaneously to move. each time the ship’s speed rating falls from 0 to -1, its crew loyalty decreases by 1. sea area to sea area a pirate may never enter (or stay in) a sea area that contains that player’s own king’s commissioner. sea area to port a pirate may enter a port from, or exit a port to, an adjoining sea area. port to sea area a player’s pirate may never leave a port if the adjoining sea area contains that player’s own king’s commissioner. sea area to adjoining transit box transit box to adjoining sea area ships in transit boxes cannot be attacked, but may be affected by events. pp action 2: find merchant ship a pirate may attempt to find a merchant ship in any merchant box in the sea area in which they are both located. roll 1d6 + pirate ability rating (+1 if merchant ship is already face up). if the result is 7 or higher, turn the merchant ship face up to see its type and cargo rating. the pirate may then loot the ship as next his action. pp action 3: loot merchant ship a merchant ship that has been found may be looted by that pirate as his very next action, even if this is on the next turn. if a storm at sea is played before looting and a storm occurs in that sea area, the merchant ship is immediately removed from play without being looted. to stop the looting any one ap player may play a warship card, activate an on station warship in that sea area or use a kc ap action to intercept and eliminate the pirate. roll 1d6 + merchant ship cargo rating and cross reference the result with the region on the merchant cargo table to find the worth of the cargo in doubloons. the pirate then decides whether or not to take the cargo. if pirate loots the merchant ship: the pirate adjusts the markers of 1 empty hold in his ship to reflect the cargo. if all his holds are already full, he must empty 1 hold before loading the new booty. his crew loyalty is adjusted by -1 if the result was 1-3, or +1 if the result was 8-10.hostages randomly draw a hostage chit and immediately: ransom the hostage: put the chit in the hostages box on the pirate display together with a nationality marker of the adjacent port; or torture the hostage: roll 1d6; if the result is greater than the pirate’s cruelty rating, note the hostage’s information rating (left) on the port grid for the adjacent port, which will make attacks on that port easier. if the result is less than or equal to the pirate’s cruelty rating, the hostage dies without providing information. crew loyalty increases by +1 and the pirate gains notoriety points equal to the hostage’s value rating (right). return the hostage to the pool of counters. if pirate does not loot the merchant ship: the merchant ship is returned to the pool, the pirate’s crew loyalty is adjusted by -1, and the action is finished. notoriety and d&r a pirate earns notoriety points equal to 1d6 + merchant ship cargo rating whether he takes the cargo or not.after being looted, whether the cargo is taken or not, return the merchant ship to the pool of counters. the pirate may declare voluntary debauchery & revelry (d&r) for his crew. place a d&r marker on the pirate marker. to remove the marker, enter a port in a subsequent action and make a d&r recovery action. pp action 4: convert merchant ship a pirate wishing to convert a merchant ship to his own use must do so immediately after the corresponding loot action, even if this is on the next turn. only sloop, schooner and brigantine merchant ships can be converted (red, blue, and green borders). flutes and 3-masted square-riggers (black borders) may not be converted. move the pirate’s ship type marker on his display to the appropriate box and set the combat and speed settings to their new maximums. all other markers are unchanged. if converting to a smaller ship with less holds, the excess (entire) holds are lost. crew loyalty increased by +1 if the new ship is bigger (more holds), and decreased by -1 if the new ship is smaller. pp action 5: in-port activities (in-port action) a pirate may not move into: a port with an anti-pirate governor unless he has attacked the port or has the appropriate letter of marque; a destroyed port; or a port with a nationality matching an attack history marker on the pirate’s display. governors are either pro-pirate or anti-pirate. ports with no governors are neutral. pirate ports never have governors and have no nationality, value or garrison. placement of an anti-pirate governor on a port automatically displaces all pirates there into the adjoining sea area. a pirate in possession of a letter of marque for a port’s nationality may treat the port as pro-pirate for all purposes except buying safe haven status. as soon as a pirate is in-port he automatically recovers from scurvy and cannot be a victim of a scurvy card. any or all of the following activities (in order) can be undertaken for only 1 in-port activities action: 1. ransom hostages the pirate must be in a pro-pirate (or anti-pirate if the appropriate letter of marque is held), safe haven, or neutral port of the same nationality as the hostage. no ransom is possible in an arab (green), portuguese (white), or pirate (black) port. doubloons: (2d6 x hostage value rating) x 10 add the doubloons to any of the pirate ship’s holds (a hold need not be emptied first). then return the hostage marker to the pool. 2. convert booty to net worth as many holds as desired may be emptied. adjust the numbers on the pirate’s net worth track. port conversion ratio (booty:net worth) pro-pirate 1:1 anti-pirate 1:1 ( with appropriate letter of marque) neutral 2:1 (1:1 with appropriate letter of marque) safe haven 1:1 + 10% (round up) pirate 1:1 ( invokes involuntary d&r) 3. refit ship damage (speed and/or damage hits) may be repaired: damage: ½ x1d6 (rounded up) in anti-pirate ports the appropriate letter of marque must be held. in safe havens add +2 to the total. in pirate ports remove all damage. refitting is never possible in arab (green) ports. later actions may be used to continue refitting. 4. purchase safe haven status safe haven status can be bought by bribing a governor in a pro-pirate port that is not a safe haven for another pirate. a pirate can have as many safe havens as he wishes. bribe: (1d6 x 100) from pirate’s net worth the pirate does not have to go ahead with the bribe once he has calculated its cost, though he adds the corresponding governor bribed chit to his display whether he goes ahead or not. a pirate may attempt to bribe a specific governor only once. if the bribe is paid, note the pirate’s safe haven location on the port grid. safe haven status ends if the pirate attacks the port, the port becomes neutral, an anti-pirate governor takes over the port, or the pirate retires or dies. 5. enter involuntary / declare voluntary d&r status d&r is involuntary if the pirate converted doubloons to net worth earlier in the action. it requires 2 d&r recovery actions to clear and gain crew loyalty point(s) in port (see d&r recovery). d&r is voluntary if the pirate allows his crew to engage in d&r as part of the current in-port activities action. it requires 1 d&r recovery action to clear and gain crew loyalty point(s) in port (see d&r recovery).pp action 6: attack port if in the sea area adjoining a port, a pirates may attack the port to gain booty and notoriety. he may also attempt to destroy the port. destroyed ports may not be attacked and pirate ports may not be attacked by pirates (only by king’s commissioners). attacking a port automatically places the pirate in that port. a warship on station in the adjoining sea area may try to stop the pirate from attacking. place a port attacked marker on the port. whether the attack is successful or not, the pirate places an attack history marker of the appropriate nationality on his display. all ports of that nationality are now anti-pirate to him, including safe havens. any letter of marque of that nationality is lost. the pirate obtains the attack result: 1d6 + ship combat rating + ability rating + hostage information points another player obtains the defense result: 1d6 + port defense rating (2d6 if port has port attacked marker) if the pirate’s attack result is greater than the defense result the attack succeeds. the pirate’s ship suffers 1 combat damage hit, he earns notoriety equal to 2 x the port value, his crew loyalty is increased by +1, and he loots doubloons equal to 100 x a number of d6 equal to the port value. the pirate automatically enters the port. the booty takes up 1 hold. if all holds are full, then a hold must be emptied before loading. if the attack result is equal to or less than the defense result the attack fails. the pirate’s ship suffers combat damage hits equal to the difference between the results, and is placed in the adjoining sea area. pp action 7: sack port (in-port action) if a pirate successfully attacks a port it may be sacked and destroyed by that pirate as his very next action, even if this is on the next turn. 1d6 + cruelty rating if the result is greater than the port defense rating, the port is destroyed and useless; place a port destroyed marker on it. the pirate gains notoriety equal to 3 x the port value, his crew loyalty is increased by +1, and his ship is placed in the adjoining sea area. the crew undergoes involuntary d&r; place a d&r marker on the pirate ship. if the result is equal to or less than the port defense rating, the attack fails, the pirate stays in the port, and he must leave and re-enter to attempt to sack it again. pp action 8: booty grab (in-port action) a pirate in same port as another pirate undergoing d&r may initiate a booty grab. each player determines: 1d6 + ability rating (booty-grabbing pirate adds +1) if the grabbing player result is higher he is successful, if lower, he gets nothing and his crew loyalty is decreased by -2; if equal, a duel automatically occurs. if successful, roll d6 and add the difference between the results. multiplied by 10, this is the percentage of the other pirate’s booty grabbed (rounded up). this is added to any of his holds, while the victim reduces the booty from any hold(s) he wishes by the same amount.pp action 9: d&r recovery (in-port action) if d&r was voluntary remove the marker by spending 1 d&r recovery action while in-port. if d&r was involuntary remove the marker by losing 1 action and then spending 1 d&r recovery action while in-port (ie 2 actions). after undergoing the recovery action, all d&r markers are removed and crew loyalty is increased immediately: +1 in a non-pirate port, and +3 in a pirate port. pp action 10: form pirate alliance a pirate with 2 pirates together in the same port may have have one of them declare a pirate alliance. the pirates must stay together, and move and undertake actions as one. if a ship combat rating is required, use the higher rating +1; for speed, use the lowest rating; for loyalty, use the lowest rating; for pirate ratings, use the rating of choice. doubloons, net worth and combat damage are divided evenly between the two allied pirates as they arise. the pirate with the highest leadership gets any remainder, except for damage, where the player assigns any remainder. the benefits of refit must be split between the pirates. speed damages, scurvy outbreak and any changes in crew loyalty apply to both ships. no letters of marque can be obtained or used by the alliance. the alliance is broken either voluntarily, if a d&r card is played against it when they are in port (the card is resolved for each pirate), or if a mutiny conspiracy card is played (the card is resolved for each pirate) and a mutiny occurs. pp actions 11: retire voluntarily a retirement action is used to get vps from a pirate’s net worth and capitalize on his notoriety. retiring is only possible in pro-pirate ports and is not possible in a pirate port. when a pirate retires everything he had (including his ship) leaves the game with him. he gains 2 vps per notoriety point and 1 vp per 100 net worth (ignore fractions). retire voluntarily the pirate must be in-port and already possess a letter of marque for that port’s nationality. the retirement action can be challenged and negated by another player playing a double-cross card as an anti-pirate action. surrender during a kc attack this retirement is part of the kc anti-pirate action is not a pirate action. the pirate must already have a letter of marque of any nationality. the retirement action can be challenged and negated by another player playing a double-cross card as an anti-pirate action. as a pirate action in a safe haven if the pirate is in one of his safe havens he may retire by simply saying so. as a pirate action in a pro-pirate port if the pirate is in a port with a pro-pirate governor (but not a safe haven), he may attempt to retire by bribing the governor. the pirate rolls d66 x 100 and gives the governor that amount from his net worth (not holds). if he pays, he retires voluntarily. if he declines, his crew loyalty is reduced by -1 and he may not bribe that particular governor again (add the corresponding governor bribed marker to his display whether the bribe is paid or not). play of a general pardon card see event card descriptions.pp action 12: draw and/or deploy new pirate pirates stay in the game until they retire (place in the retired pirates box) or are eliminated (place in the davy jones locker box). the pirate card can then not be used again. a player may never have more pirates in play than the total number with which he began the game. a player may obtain a new pirate by randomly drawing a new pirate card from the deck. he may then deploy it as part of the action or hold the card in hand. players may have the following maximum pirates: 5 or 4 players: 3 in hand, 2 in play; 3 players: 3 in hand and 3 in play; 2 players: 4 in hand and 4 in play. cunning each cunning point allows the pirate to reroll any one 1d6, 2d6 or 3d6 roll whenever he wishes. reduce the total on his display whenever a point is used in this manner. a cunning point also allows the pirate to play the skull & crossbones event card on his behalf. mutiny a mutiny may occur due to a mutiny conspiracy card, but a mutiny automatically occurs whenever a ship’s crew loyalty rating falls to 0, or is 0 prior to an action. roll d6 and compare the result to the pirate’s leadership rating. if greater, the pirate is eliminated. deploy a new pirate from your hand to take over the ship and everything on it (except the net worth, and remove notoriety and cunning markers). reset crew loyalty to 6; combat and speed are unchanged. if the player has no new pirate draw a new one from the top of the deck (if none, the ship is lost). if the roll is equal to leadership, the ship’s crew loyalty is reduced by -1 (if at 0 it remains at 0). if the roll is less than leadership, nothing happens. duel each pirate rolls d6 equal to their duel rating. the highest total wins. if the duel was because of a piratical ambition card, if the new pirate wins he takes over the ship and everything on it (except the net worth, and remove notoriety and cunning markers). the original pirate is eliminated. if the new pirate loses he is killed and never gets into the game but nothing else happens. a tied duel is re-fought until a winner is determined. if the duel was during a booty grab, the winner can take any or all of the victim’s possessions (except their net worth), transferring them to his ship. or, he may replace his ship with the loser’s ship, transferring everything to the new ship. the losing pirate dies. a tied duel can be re-fought if both players agree, otherwise the booty grab action ends and both pirates remain in port. king’s commissioners king’s commissioners (kcs) have speed (left) and combat (right) ratings on their counters. kcs can arrive as a pirate’s ap action or by play of an event card. ap action 1: attempt to deploy a kc roll 3d6; if the result is less than the notoriety points of an active pirate not in a port or a transit area, place a randomly drawn kc in same sea area as the pirate. that kc continues to be controlled by that player, but only 1 kc can be controlled by a player at any one time. eliminated kcs are out of the game permanently.ap action 2: use a kc during a given player turn, only 1 kc may perform a kc ap action against the pp’s pirate each time the pirate conducts an action (in addition to any other ap player). 1. move move the kc into an adjacent sea area or into or out of a transit box (the kc may never enter a port). 2. attack a pirate a kc may attempt to intercept a pirate (either in the same sea area or after a free move into an adjacent sea area) and engage it in battle. this ap action may be attempted if the active pirate has announced or is performing one of the following actions: move, find merchant ship, loot merchant ship, after a convert merchant ship, or a failed attack port. a kc may not attempt an intercept on the turn a pirate is deployed. once the ap action is announced, the pirate decides whether to try to evade or move straight to the battle. if evading, both players roll a die. the kc subtracts -1 if he moved into the pirate’s sea area in this action: intercept/evade: 1d6 + speed rating if the kc result is greater than the pirate result, the pirate is intercepted and a battle follows immediately unless the pirate decides to hand over a letter of marque (any nationality) and retire. if the kc result equals or is lower than the pirate result, the pirate successfully evades, but his action is over. if the pirate is intercepted after announcing a loot merchant ship action (but before performing it), the merchant escapes and is placed back in the pool. if intercepted during the action the pirate keeps what he has looted so far but the merchant escapes. battle (pirate): 1d6 + combat rating + ability rating battle (kc): 1d6 + combat rating if the kc result is greater than the pirate result, the pirate is eliminated. the pirate scores vps equal to his notoriety points (but none for his net worth), and the kc scores half of this total. if the kc result equals or is lower than the pirate result, the pirate defeats the kc. the pirate gains 2 x kc combat rating in notoriety points, and his crew loyalty is increased by +1. the kc is removed from the game permanently and the pirate may proceed with his action. 3. attack and destroy a pirate port a kc may attempt to destroy a pirate port from the adjoining sea area at any time during a pirate’s action. if there are no pirates in the port it is automatically destroyed and useless (place a port destroyed marker). kc 1d6 + combat rating each pirate in the port 1d6 + combat rating if the kc result is greater than every pirate result, all pirates are forced into the adjoining sea area, suffer 1 combat damage hit, and the port is destroyed and useless (place a port destroyed marker). if the kc result equals or is lower than any pirate result the attack fails and the ap action ends. 4. oust the currently active pirate from a port a kc may attempt to oust a pirate from a port (any except a pirate port) from the adjoining sea area at any time during a pirate’s player turn. kc: 1d6 + combat rating pirate: 1d6 + combat ratings of all pirates in port if the kc result is greater than the pirate result, all pirates must move to the sea area and discontinue any actions they were undertaking.if the kc result equals or is lower than the pirate result, the oust fails and each pirate gains 1 notoriety point. note that placement of an anti-pirate governor automatically ousts all pirates into the sea area (but no notoriety points are gained). ap action 3: use any on-station warship new warships enter the game via a warship sighting event card. no more than 1 card may be played against a pirate during a pirate action. warships can be used to attack a pirate if the active pirate has announced one of the following actions: find merchant ship, loot merchant ship, or attack port. place a randomly drawn warship (with its cargo side showing) in the sea area adjoining the port where the pirate is performing one of the above actions. the warship may immediately attack the pirate if the ap player wishes. once its strength is revealed the ap player may choose not to attack and leave the warship on station. only 1 warship may ever be on station in any one sea area. on station warships (those already on the map) can be activated by any player to attack a pirate as an ap action without the use of an event card. once the ap action is announced, the warship must first intercept the pirate. each player rolls: intercept/evade: 1d6 + speed rating if the warship result is greater than the pirate result, the pirate is intercepted and a battle follows immediately. if the warship result equals or is lower than the pirate result, the pirate escapes. any merchant ship involved is removed. the warship remains on station where it is. battle (pirate): 1d6 + combat rating + ability rating (-2 if currently undergoing d&r) battle (warship): 1d6 + combat rating if the pirate’s result is greater than the warship’s result, the pirate suffers 1 combat damage hit and receives notoriety points equal to the warship combat rating. the warship is returned to the pool and the pirate must proceed with his action. if the pirate’s result is equal to or less than the warship’s result, the pirate’s action is cancelled and the pirate suffers combat damage hits equal to the difference between the results. his crew loyalty is decreased by -1. ap action 4: play an ap event card ap event cards are denoted by a symbol on the card. ships pirate ship ratings are on the corresponding pirate display. the 3 ship types have the following starting/ maximum capacities: sloop (combat 5, speed 5, holds 2) schooner (combat 6, speed 3, holds 3) brigantine (combat 7, speed 1, holds 4) for each damage hit suffered, move the speed and/ or combat marker (depending on the type of hit) down its track. damage hits from battle or a port attack affect only its combat rating. when a marker reaches the sunk box, the ship is sunk and everything aboard, including the pirate, is lost/dead. merchant ship counters have one rating, cargo capacity. warships and king’s commissioners have two ratings, speed and combat. v1"

it can be anywhere on the board. you cannot move figures from 2 different provinces in the same action, nor move your figures to 2 different provinces. you can only march from any one province to any other. using this action is generally the only way to get your figures to yggdrasil. there are no villages in yggdrasil, so there is no limit to the number of figures you can have there. upgrade your clan sheet has slots for up to 8 upgrades: one each for your warriors, leader and ship, 2 for monsters, and 3 for your clan. choose an upgrade card from your hand and pay rage equal to that card’s str. place the card in the appropriate slot on your clan sheet. if there is more than 1 potential slot, choose which to use. if there is already a card in that slot, discard the old card and replace it with the new one. the new upgrade card is now in permanent effect, granting you any benefits listed on it. leaders and ships always retain the abilities shown on the clan sheet, even if they are upgraded. if your clan has 2 upgrades in different slots that give you the same type of benefit, both cards take effect independently. one does not cancel the other. troop upgrades: when you play a leader, warrior, or ship upgrade, if you have the corresponding figure in your reserve, you may immediately (before the next player’s turn) invade with it without spending any extra rage. monster upgrades: when you play a monster upgrade, take the corresponding figure, attach your clan’s base to it and place it in your reserve. it is now yours for the rest of the game, counting as one of your figures. you may immediately invade with it without spending any extra rage. your monster can die and be sent to valhalla like any other figure, returning to your reserve in the next release valhalla phase. it can gain glory for you during the ragnarök phase just like any other figure. you can only have 2 monsters as part of your clan at a time. if you discard a monster’s card in order to place a new monster in its upgrade slot, the old monster figure is immediately returned to the box. quest take a quest card from your hand and commit to it by placing it facedown on your clan sheet, on top of your clan’s animal symbol. it costs no rage to commit to a quest and there is no limit to the number of them you can commit to during each age (remember you can’t take any action if you’re down to 0 rage). you may commit to 2 quests of the same type (each giving its reward independently). you may inspect your quests at any time. during this phase, try to fulfill the demands of the quests you commit to, reaping the rewards listed on them during the next quest phase. however, there’s no penalty for failing a quest. pillage choose a province that has at least 1 of your figures in it (or in a supporting fjord) and has not yet been successfully pillaged this phase (its pillage token is showing the reward side up). it costs no rage to pillage (remember you can’t take any action if you’re down to 0 rage). a pillaging action is resolved by following 3 steps in order: 1. call to battle once you have declared your intent to pillage a province, starting with the player to your left and going clockwise, each player (including you) may, if they wish, move 1 of their figures from an adjacent province into an empty village in the province you are pillaging. this does not cost rage (ships cannot be moved). any number of figures can join a battle in yggdrasil.once all villages in the province are occupied, or when no one else wishes to join in, the battle begins. if there are no enemy figures in the province or its supporting fjord, no battle takes place and you automatically pillage the province, gaining its reward and flipping its pillage token to its pillaged side. in this case you don’t gain any glory for winning battles. otherwise, a battle takes place, and all figures in the province being pillaged, or its supporting fjord, must participate in it. 2. play cards each player participating in the battle must choose 1 card from their hand and hold it facedown in front of them (unless they have no cards left in their hand; in that case they don’t have to put a card in). then all reveal their chosen card simultaneously. if you reveal a red battle card, its +str bonus is added to the total str of your figures in the battle, and any special abilities listed on the card take effect. if you reveal a black upgrade or green quest card, it adds nothing to your str in battle and has no effect. each clan adds together the str of each of its involved figures, and adds the +str bonus offered by their played battle card (if any). this is their clan’s total str in that battle. if a card’s special effect causes a player to lose all the figures he had in the battle before comparing str, his clan is not out of the battle. the figures were destroyed in the course of battle, and the clan might still win if its played battle card has str enough. 3. resolution the player with the highest str total wins the battle. on a tie, all participating players lose the battle. the winner of the battle (if any) must discard all cards he played. the losers of the battle return all of their played cards to their hands. all losing players must destroy all of their figures that were in the battle (including those that were supporting from fjords), placing them on the valhalla sheet. if the player who initiated the pillage wins the battle, they pillage the province and gain the reward indicated in the pillage token (see the reference sheet). flip the token to its pillaged side to indicate that the province cannot be pillaged again until the next age. if the pillager does not win the battle, the province is not pillaged and nobody gets the pillage reward. any player (including the pillager) can try again later in the phase to pillage the province. finally, the winner of the battle, whether he’s the pillaging player or not, gains glory equal to their current axes stat. 3. discard all players must discard any cards that may still remain in their hands. they can only keep a single card to use on the next age (if they have any). on the third age players should discard all cards, completely emptying their hands.4. quest each player reveals all quests they have committed to. if you have met a quest’s demands, you gain the amount of glory indicated on the card, and may also raise any 1 of your clan stats 1 step. if you fail to fulfill a quest, you get nothing, but you also lose nothing. discard all revealed quests, whether successful or not. most quests involve having the most str in a given province. add together the str of each of your figures in that province (including the supporting fjord) and compare your total to the total str of each other clan in that same province. if your total is greater, you fulfill the quest. if you tie with an enemy, you fail the quest. 5. ragnarök take the token that’s on the current ragnarök slot and place it on its corresponding province, with the destroyed side facing up. that province is destroyed forever and is out of the game. when a province is destroyed this way, all figures in that province, and in its supporting fjord, die and are placed in valhalla. each such figure earns its clan glory equal to that indicated on each ragnarök slot on the age track. for each of your figures (including monsters) destroyed in ragnarök, you gain 2 glory on the first age, 3 glory on the second age, and 4 glory on the third age. next, place the doom token on the province indicated by the next age’s ragnarök token. 6. release valhalla all figures in valhalla are returned to their respective owners. move all figures on the valhalla sheet belonging to your clan back to your reserve. any figures on the board remain there. end of an age flip all pillage tokens on the board back to their reward side. these tokens stay on the same province throughout the game. pass the first player token to the player to the left. move the saga token down to the first phase of the next age on the age track. end of the game once the release valhalla phase of the third age is completed, the world has come to an end, and so has the game. for each of your clan stats that has been increased to the 4th or 5th step, gain +10 glory. for each of your clan stats that has been increased to the last step, gain +20 glory. the player whose clan has the most glory is the winner."

it does not have to be the closest. if you need more than 1 iron, you can consume each iron from a different iron works. consuming iron in this way is free. 2. if there are no unflipped iron works, you can purchase iron from the iron market, starting at the cheapest price. if the iron market is empty, you can still purchase iron for £6 / . consuming beer you may need to consume beer when selling cotton, manufactured goods, or pottery; or when performing the network action during the rail era. the amount required is shown in the top right corner of the industry tile. beer may be consumed from any of the following sources: 1. your unflipped breweries. these do not need to be connected to the location where the beer is required. 2. an opponent’s unflipped brewery. these must be connected to the location where the beer is required. 3. the space beside a merchant tile you are selling to. when multiple beer barrels are required, each may be consumed from a different source. other flipping industry tiles at the end of each era, flipped industry tiles score vps. when flipped, they have a black top half and a vp icon in the bottom left corner. different industry tiles are flipped in different ways: cotton mills, manufacturers, and potteries: flip when you perform a sell action. coal mines, iron works, and breweries: flip when the last resource is removed from the tile. this often happens during an opponent’s turn. connected locations two locations are considered connected to each other if you can trace a route of link tiles (owned by any player) from one location to the other. increasing your income whenever one of your industry tiles is flipped, increase your income: immediately advance your income marker along the progress track by the number of spaces (not income levels) shown. you cannot increase your income level above level 30. winning the game after performing rail era scoring, the player with the most vps is the winner. ties are broken, first by the highest income, and then by the most money remaining. if still tied, those players draw."

belgae, picts, angles, normans. starting units are placed on the map. 16 roman infantry are placed in the english channel, and 1 infantry is placed in each of the starting areas as follows: the caledonians: caithness, hebrides, orkneys. the picts: alban, dalriada, dunedin, mar, moray, skye. the brigantes: bernicia, cheshire, cumbria, galloway, lothian, march, pennines, strathclyde, york. the belgae: downlands, essex, kent, lindsey, n. mercia, s. mercia, norfolk, suffolk, sussex, wessex. the welsh: avalon, clwyd, cornwall, devon, dyfed, gwent, gwynedd, hwicce, powys. victory points there are 4 main ways to score victory points (vp). vp tokens are kept separate near a nation’s card and visible to all. hold symbol (fist): if the nation is the sole occupant of the areas at the end of the round(s), score the vps. at the end of each scoring round marked on the timeline, consult the nation list on the board and go through the nations in order, checking each nation’s card to see how many vps they receive for holding areas. occupy symbol (flag): if the nation is the sole occupant of the areas at any time during the round(s), score the vps. vps may be scored for just moving through the area during the round (if no other nation’s units are present). as soon as a nation is the sole occupant of the listed area, take the appropriate vps. a nation may score for holding an area multiple times, but may only score for occupying each area once. eliminate symbol (skull): if the nation eliminates the units at any time during the round(s), score the vps. as soon as a nation eliminates a relevant unit, take the vps, whether it wins the battle or not. some specific nation units may only score points for eliminating units on their nation turn (ie. they must be the attacker). bretwalda and the king: there may be a bretwalda elected in rounds 8-10, and a king elected in rounds 11-14 and 16. roman victory points at the end of round 5, the romans score vps for limes (submitted nations and intact roman forts). they also receive 6 vps if the belgae submit to them in round 1. if the welsh, the brigantes, or the picts submit to the romans, the romans receive vps for the areas occupied or held by those nations as if they occupied or held the areas themselves. victory point limits in a scoring round: total welsh vps for holding areas outside wales may not be more than half the vps scored for holding areas in wales. total saxons vps for holding areas in wales may not be more than half the vps scored for holding areas in england. total angles vps for holding areas in scotland may not be more than half the vps scored for holding areas in england. game round the game lasts 16 game rounds. at the start of each round, consult the timeline to see what events occur and if any invading armies are placed on the board. a round consists of all the 17 nations taking their nation turn in the order stated in the nation list on the board (note that the jutes play after the saxons) . if a nation is not in the game, skip its nation turn. a turn consists of 5 phases. 1: increase population receive population points (pp) based on the number of areas occupied by your nation’s armies. normal areas provide 2 pp, difficult terrain areas 1 pp. for each count of 6, the nation receives 1 new infantry unit from its unit pool. any leftover points (up to 5 pp, any extra are lost) are saved until the next turn (place the nation’s increase population marker on the appropriate space on the population track). you cannot refuse to increase your population. one new infantry army can be placed on each area occupied by the nation. if an army cannot be placed due to stacking limits, it is lost, but the population marker remains at 5 on the population track. armies in play are limited by the components. romans receive reinforcements instead of pp. 2: movement you may move any, all, or none of the nation’s armies. armies may not normally move into a sea area. armies may move up to 2 land areas per turn. cavalry units and roman infantry may move 3 land areas per turn. all units must end their move when they move into a difficult terrain area, or an area containing an opposing nation’s units (unless they are able to overrun through the area). armies with leaders (for the entire move) may move 3 areas per turn, and need not stop in difficult terrain. roman armies may also use roman roads to move several spaces in a single turn. armies may move across straits (yellow arrows) as though the destination area were adjacent. this takes all of an army’s move. stacking limits each nation (except the romans) may have no more than 3 armies in a non-difficult terrain area, 2 in a difficult terrain area. however, each nation may have a single overstack:1 group of an unlimited number in a non-difficult terrain area or 1 group of up to 4 armies in a difficult terrain area (but not both). stacking limits are effective at the end of every nation’s movement phase, but not during movement. limits may not be exceeded during the increase population phase, or as a result of retreats. romans can have any number of armies in each non-difficult terrain area and up to 4 in each difficult terrain area. forts do not count. romans do not have an overstack capability. stacking limits may be exceeded when placing round 1 belgae reinforcements and round 7 romano-british reinforcements. overruns if the number of armies moving into an area is less than or equal to twice the number of opposing forces (armies and forts/ burhs, but not leaders), all the attacking armies must stop and fight the battle (when all movement is complete). if the moving armies outnumber the opposing forces by more than 2 to 1, the excess armies may move through the area (overrun) without stopping (if the move is still legal).boat movement during a nation’s boat movement turns, a nation may move their units through 1 sea area (maximum) as part of their normal move. if the armies have a leader, they may move an additional land area before or after landing. during a major invasion, boat movement may be used during either or both halves of the invasion if other rules are respected. invasions invasions are indicated on the timeline, along with the number of armies the nation receives that round and the sea area in which they are placed during the nation’s turn, after their increase population phase. they must do one of the following: land in a bordering land area and then may move 1 additional land area. move to an adjacent sea area and then land in an adjacent land area. during a raiding turn or during the first half of a major invasion, remain in the sea area they started in. there are no stacking limits or battles in sea areas. armies beginning their movement phase in a sea area may never move 2 sea areas before landing in a land area. normally, all armies must end their move in a land area, but are not required to all land in the same area. after landing, roman infantry, cavalry, and armies with a leader may move 1 additional area (following normal rules). nations may have additional landing restrictions. restrictions apply only to units that begin their nation turn at sea, not to units that begin their turn on land and use boat movement. during a nation’s major invasion turns, all of the nation’s units may move and attack twice, and the player takes 2 movement and battles/retreats phases in succession. also, an army may stay at sea (not move) during the first movement phase. all the nation’s armies must end their second movement phase on land (unless they are on a raiding turn). raiding during a nation’s raiding turns, their armies that are in a sea area at the beginning of their turn are raiding armies and may end their turn at sea in 3 ways: 1. remain at sea where they started and and not move. 2. retreat back to sea where they started after landing and engaging in battle. 3. withdraw back to sea where they started during the raider withdrawal phase (pick up and place the armies). the invader restrictions on some nation’s cards also apply to raiding armies. if a major invasion is also a raiding turn: the raider withdrawal phase is moved to after the second battles/retreats phase. dane raiding armies in round 11 must return to sea by the end of their nation turn, via any of the ways listed above. during pict raiding turns, all their armies are considered to be raiding armies, even those beginning the turn on land. when picts are raiding, pictish armies in a land area may (using boat movement) move to an adjacent sea area, then to an adjacent land area, battle, and then retreat or withdraw (during the raider withdrawal phase) to the land area they originated from, provided that area is still unoccupied by another nation. picts may not raid overland: they must go by sea.3: battles/retreats nations occupying the same land area at the end of a movement phase must battle (even if controlled by the same player). the nation that moved into the area is the attacker, and the nation already there is the defender. the attacker chooses the resolution order of multiple battles. there is no combat at sea. each nation rolls 1 die for each army and fort/burh they have in the area. die rolls are considered simultaneous. 1. normal army eliminates a normal army on 5+. 2. roman or cavalry army eliminates a normal army on 4+. 3. roman and cavalry armies are eliminated on 6+, no matter the type of attacking unit. 4. any defending army in difficult terrain is eliminated on 6+. roman forts and saxon burhs act as normal armies. any roman armies in an area with a fort must be eliminated before the fort may be eliminated. in battles where cavalry and infantry are on the same side, 5s kill infantry while 6s kill cavalry or infantry as the opposing player desires. in any other case, the controlling player chooses which armies are eliminated. when a leader is present, add 1 to the die roll of each army and fort/burh of the leader’s nation. no die is rolled for leaders. a leader is immediately eliminated if losses leave him alone in an area, even free of opposing armies, without units of his nation. battle continues until all the armies and forts/burhs of 1 or both nations are eliminated, or until a player retreats all their units. if both sides have armies in the area after the opportunity to retreat, another round of battle is fought. repeat the procedure until 1 nation is left or they are both eliminated simultaneously. retreats after both players have rolled dice and eliminated units, if both sides have at least 1 surviving unit, the defender may choose to retreat some or all of his units involved in the battle. if the defender still has at least 1 unit in the area, the attacker may then choose to retreat. a leader can retreat alone before the last army of his nation is eliminated, but only to an adjacent area occupied solely by units of his nation. the defender may retreat to: adjacent areas solely occupied by their own units; or adjacent areas vacant and not adjacent to a land area occupied solely by the attacker’s units (other than the battle area). stacking limits must be observed. adjacent areas also include areas connected to the battle area by a strait. however, a unit at one end of a strait does not prevent retreat to an area at the other end of the strait. the defender may never retreat to a sea area, any area containing enemy units, or any area from which the opposing armies entered the battle area (including armies that went through the battle area as part of an overrun, but did not actually participate in the battle). if no legal retreat area is available, the defender must stay and continue the battle. the attacker may retreat to: land areas from which they entered the battle area. if the area contains another nation’s army, the attacker must stay in the battle area and fight again. stacking limits must be observed. if the army attacked from sea, it must retreat to the land or sea area in which it began the movement phase, even if this is not the sea area from which it entered the battle. however armies may only retreat and end their turn at sea during a raiding turn or the first half of a major invasion. armies attacking an area via a boat move may retreat via a boat move to the area they started the move in (if it is still unoccupied by another nation). 4: raider withdrawal raiding armies may withdraw back to the sea area they started the turn in, even if they have used up all their normal movement and engaged in a battle. pick up the raiding armies you are withdrawing and place them in the sea area they started in. 5: overpopulation if a nation has more than twice the number of armies in land areas than it has occupied land areas, it must remove the excess. no area can be emptied, nor can a player remove more armies than are required to end overpopulation. armies at sea (ie. returned to homelands) do not count. the romans are not subject to overpopulation. end of the game round after every nation has taken its turn, perform these steps in order: 1: score for holding areas at the end of as scoring rounds, each nation gains vps for holding the areas indicated on its card. these are in addition to any scored during its nation turn. 2: score for bretwalda or the king at the end of rounds marked by a crown players determine whether any nation has claimed bretwalda or a king. move the marker to the next round on the timeline. leaders some nations receive leaders when indicated on their card and on the timeline. special conditions may need to be met before a leader can be brought into play. a leader whose starting location is not specified is placed on the board at the end of the nation’s increase population phase in any area occupied by the nation’s units. if the leader’s nation has no armies in any land areas, he may not enter play. a leader does not count for purposes of overruns, overpopulation, or stacking limits. a leader may never be in an area without armies of his nation, and must move out with armies that must vacate an area. a leader is removed from the board at the beginning of its nation’s next turn before increase population is calculated. when the angles receive leaders only if they occupy a certain area, a submitted brigante nation occupying the area counts. in either case the leader is not required to appear. the saxon harold, norwegian harald hardrada, and norman william the conqueror all enter play in round 15, and remain in play until the end of the game. winning the game at the end of the game each player adds together the number of vps that each of his nations has scored. the player with the most vps wins. negotiations players may discuss strategy and negotiate agreements only while another player is taking his turn, and no secret negotiations are allowed. no deal can be binding. tracking occupied areas a nation may only score points for occupying a given area once. place the vps that the welsh or norsemen receive for occupying areas over multiple rounds in the area itself, and then later remove them to their card at the end of round 9 for the welsh and the end of round 16 for the norsemen. the norsemen may score vps for holding areas in rounds 13 and 16 even if they have already scored for occupying the areas.the bretwalda at the end of rounds 8-10, vote for a bretwalda of england. each nation must cast 1 vote for each english area it occupies. if brigante has submitted to the angles, brigante-occupied galloway must vote with the angles. any player may call for a secret ballot, to be revealed simultaneously. a nation that gains more than half of the votes cast claims the bretwalda and 4 vps. the king at the end of rounds 11-14, a nation that occupies twice as many areas in england as any other nation (minimum 4) claims kingship of england and gains 8 vps and an infantry unit, placed on the board according to the increase population phase rules. in round 16 only harold, william, harald hardrada, and svein estrithson are eligible to be king (if alive). if all but one of these leaders are dead, the survivor automatically becomes king, unless some nation other than these holds twice as many areas as the prospective king’s nation. in this case no one is king. 10 vps are given for this kingship. roman special rules roman reinforcements reinforcements received during the roman nation’s increase population phase depend on how many roman armies are in play: round #armies 2 3 4 5 12+ 0 0 0 0 11 1 0 0 0 10 1 1 0 0 9 1 1 1 0 7-8 2 2 1 1 6 3 3 2 2 5 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 3 3 reinforcements are placed in the english channel. during the movement phase they must move to an adjacent land area. at the end of the round 2 roman nation turn, you must remove roman armies to reduce the number in play to 12. roman forts and roads when a roman army becomes the sole occupant of any area for the first time, even if only moving through, a fort is immediately built there. forts cannot move. if a roman fort is eliminated, flip it over to its destroyed side as a reminder that a fort has already been built in that area. if a roman army moves from a fort area to an adjacent fort area, it doesn’t count against that army’s capability to move 3 areas. a fort does not provide this advantage in the movement phase during which it is built. however, forts built during the first half of the roman major invasion in round 1 do provide road movement during the second half of the invasion. destroyed forts no longer provide the roads capability.roman scoring rounds 1-3: the romans score vps for occupying areas during their turn in rounds 1-3, as marked by an intact or destroyed fort. they may also score vps for occupying areas in these rounds if another nation submits to the romans during them. when the submission is declared, the romans immediately score vps for the areas occupied by the now-subject nation. if the nation later occupies a new area while still in submission to the romans, the romans score vps as if they occupied the area. end of round 5: the romans score vps for each area listed on their card that is either occupied by an intact roman fort, or occupied by a subject nation. submission to roman rule when the welsh, brigantes, or picts occupy 5, 3, or 3 areas or fewer, respectively, they may submit to roman rule (only during a roman turn and while roman armies are still on the board) after any battle finishes, or after any round of battle, or after any roman movement phase. any roman armies in an area held by a subject nation when submission is declared must move immediately to any adjacent roman-occupied area(s); if there are none, they can move to any adjacent vacant area(s). if after use roman road movement to move farther. if there is no roman-occupied or vacant area adjacent, the armies can be moved to any roman-occupied area(s) adjacent to any area occupied by the submitting nation. if there is still none, they can be moved to any vacant area(s) adjacent to any area occupied by the submitting nation. if none of these apply, the armies are eliminated. submitting has the following effects: 1. in rounds 1-3, the romans immediately gain vps for the areas occupied by the subject nation, but only if the romans have not already scored for these areas. the romans may not then later receive vps for occupying those areas (a nation can only score for occupying an area once). however, they may receive vps for the areas held by the subject nation at the end of round 5. 2. the romans can no longer attack the subject nation, and the subjects cannot attack the romans or other roman subjects. 3. subject nations receive only half the usual pps (round up, min. increase 1). however, each turn the roman player may allow subjects to increase population fully. 4. subject nations receive only half vps for holding areas at the end of round 5 (round up). 5. subject nations cannot leave vacant at the end of their move any area they occupy at the beginning of movement unless permitted to do so by the romans. 6. roman armies can move freely through, but not end a turn in, subject areas. subject areas where there is no destroyed roman fort count as having roman roads. submission ends when the romans leave at the start of round 6. the belgae may submit to the romans only on roman round 1, if the belgae are reduced to 4 or fewer areas. they unsubmit on their own turn in round 1 before their increase population phase (boudicca’s revolt). their reinforcing army is placed in whichever belgae area boudicca is placed, without regard to stacking limits. the romans score points for submitted belgae areas, and can later build forts in former belgae territory. romans score vps (for their rounds 1-3 occupation) for areas occupied by the belgae when/if the belgae submit in round 1. since the belgae unsubmit in their own turn in round 1, the romans do not score for areas the belgae move into after this, nor do they score limes points for areas held by belgae in round 5.romano-british special rules at the start of round 6, the romans leave britain and the romano-british nation enters play. the romano-british do not perform the increase population phase in round 6. instead, the player replaces 8 surviving roman forts in and south of york and cheshire with romano-british armies. any other roman forts are removed from the board. if there are fewer than 8 forts left, then roman armies in and south of york and cheshire are replaced by romano-british armies until there are up to 8 romano-british armies on the board. any remaining roman armies are then removed from the board. no romano-british army can be placed north of york and cheshire. round 7: arthur in round 7, arthur and 2 cavalry units must all be placed at the end of the increase population phase, in a region with a romano-british army (not subject to stacking limits). if there are no romano-british armies on the board, arthur and his cavalry may still enter the game in a vacant land area in england south of cumbria, pennines, and bernicia, including welsh areas. if there are no romano-british armies and no eligible vacant areas, arthur and his cavalry are not placed. arthur and his cavalry may be placed in an empty area even if there are romano-british on the board. at the start of round 8, arthur is removed and his cavalry are replaced with infantry armies. if there are already 8 romano- british infantry armies on the board, use the cavalry pieces to represent infantry. the romano-british and submitted nations until the start of round 8, the romano-british cannot attack any nation that submitted to the romans unless that nation has already attacked them. because the belgae rebel against the romans even if they originally submitted, they do not count as one of these nations. if such an attack happens in rounds 6-7, the romano-british may attack the attacking, formerly submitted nation, and scores vps for eliminating their armies (as they do for angles, saxons, and jutes) until the start of round 8. norwegian special rules round 16: special reinforcements in round 16, the norwegians receive special reinforcements, placed on the board at the beginning of round 16 in addition to any armies they receive during the increase population phases of their turns. reinforcements are placed in order of normal play. if there are not enough unused armies, the excess are lost. regardless of whether they receive special reinforcements or not, the norwegians perform their increase population phase normally. if harald hardrada is in play: 1 reinforcing army (north sea) for each area that they occupy. round 16: the king in round 16 only harold, william, harald hardrada, and svein estrithson are eligible to be king (if alive). if all but one of these leaders are dead, the survivor automatically becomes king, unless some nation other than these holds twice as many areas as the prospective king’s nation. in this case no one is king. 10 vps are given for this kingship.4: raider withdrawal raiding armies may withdraw back to the sea area they started the turn in, even if they have used up all their normal movement and engaged in a battle. pick up the raiding armies you are withdrawing and place them in the sea area they started in. 5: overpopulation if a nation has more than twice the number of armies in land areas than it has occupied land areas, it must remove the excess. no area can be emptied, nor can a player remove more armies than are required to end overpopulation. armies at sea (ie. returned to homelands) do not count. the romans are not subject to overpopulation. end of the game round after every nation has taken its turn, perform these steps in order: 1: score for holding areas at the end of as scoring rounds, each nation gains vps for holding the areas indicated on its card. these are in addition to any scored during its nation turn. 2: score for bretwalda or the king at the end of rounds marked by a crown players determine whether any nation has claimed bretwalda or a king. move the marker to the next round on the timeline. leaders some nations receive leaders when indicated on their card and on the timeline. special conditions may need to be met before a leader can be brought into play. a leader whose starting location is not specified is placed on the board at the end of the nation’s increase population phase in any area occupied by the nation’s units. if the leader’s nation has no armies in any land areas, he may not enter play. a leader does not count for purposes of overruns, overpopulation, or stacking limits. a leader may never be in an area without armies of his nation, and must move out with armies that must vacate an area. a leader is removed from the board at the beginning of its nation’s next turn before increase population is calculated. when the angles receive leaders only if they occupy a certain area, a submitted brigante nation occupying the area counts. in either case the leader is not required to appear. the saxon harold, norwegian harald hardrada, and norman william the conqueror all enter play in round 15, and remain in play until the end of the game. winning the game at the end of the game each player adds together the number of vps that each of his nations has scored. the player with the most vps wins. negotiations players may discuss strategy and negotiate agreements only while another player is taking his turn, and no secret negotiations are allowed. no deal can be binding. tracking occupied areas a nation may only score points for occupying a given area once. place the vps that the welsh or norsemen receive for occupying areas over multiple rounds in the area itself, and then later remove them to their card at the end of round 9 for the welsh and the end of round 16 for the norsemen. the norsemen may score vps for holding areas in rounds 13 and 16 even if they have already scored for occupying the areas.the bretwalda at the end of rounds 8-10, vote for a bretwalda of england. each nation must cast 1 vote for each english area it occupies. if brigante has submitted to the angles, brigante-occupied galloway must vote with the angles. any player may call for a secret ballot, to be revealed simultaneously. a nation that gains more than half of the votes cast claims the bretwalda and 4 vps. the king at the end of rounds 11-14, a nation that occupies twice as many areas in england as any other nation (minimum 4) claims kingship of england and gains 8 vps and an infantry unit, placed on the board according to the increase population phase rules. in round 16 only harold, william, harald hardrada, and svein estrithson are eligible to be king (if alive). if all but one of these leaders are dead, the survivor automatically becomes king, unless some nation other than these holds twice as many areas as the prospective king’s nation. in this case no one is king. 10 vps are given for this kingship.brigante special rules submission to roman rule when the brigantes occupy 3 areas or fewer, they may submit to roman rule (only during a roman turn and while roman armies are still on the board) after any battle finishes, or after any round of battle, or after any roman movement phase. any roman armies in an area held by a subject nation when submission is declared must move immediately to any adjacent roman-occupied area(s); if there are none, they can move to any adjacent vacant area(s). if after use roman road movement to move farther. if there is no roman-occupied or vacant area adjacent, the armies can be moved to any roman-occupied area(s) adjacent to any area occupied by the submitting nation. if there is still none, they can be moved to any vacant area(s) adjacent to any area occupied by the submitting nation. if none of these apply, the armies are eliminated. submitting has the following effects: 1. in rounds 1-3, the romans immediately gain vps for the areas occupied by the subject nation. the romans may not then later receive vps for occupying those areas (a nation can only score for occupying an area once). however, they may receive vps for the areas held by the subject nation at the end of round 5. 2. the romans can no longer attack the subject nation, and the subjects cannot attack the romans or other roman subjects. 3. subject nations receive only half the usual pps (round up, min. increase 1). however, each turn the roman player may allow subjects to increase population fully. 4. subject nations receive only half vps for holding areas at the end of round 5 (round up). 5. subject nations cannot leave vacant at the end of their move any area they occupy at the beginning of movement unless permitted to do so by the romans. 6. roman armies can move freely through, but not end a turn in, subject areas. subject areas where there is no destroyed roman fort count as having roman roads. submission ends when the romans leave at the start of round 6. brigante submission to the angles if the brigantes only occupy 1 or 2 areas in scotland and galloway, they may submit only galloway and brigante-occupied areas in scotland to the angles (even if they occupy other areas outside scotland and galloway). brigante armies in areas other than scotland and galloway may abandon those areas when the brigantes have submitted to angles. (since the angles can attack them, the brigantes can abandon.) once submitted, no brigante armies may attack the angles; but angles can attack brigante-occupied areas in wales and england (except galloway), and brigantes there will fight back. submitting has the following effects: 1. the angles can score vps at the end of round 7 and round 10 for all brigante-occupied areas and brigantes will score half vps for their areas (round up). 2. the angles can no longer attack the brigantes, and the brigantes cannot attack the angles or other angles subjects. 3. the brigantes receive only half the usual pps (round up, min. increase 1). however, each turn the angle player may allow subjects to increase population fully. 4. the brigantes cannot leave vacant at the end of their move any area they occupy at the beginning of movement unless permitted to do so by the angles. 5. the angles are not allowed to move through brigante-occupied spaces.submission ends at the end of round 12, or when all angle armies have been eliminated. the bretwalda at the end of rounds 8-10, when voting for a bretwalda of england, if brigante has submitted to the angles, brigante-occupied galloway must vote with the angles. saxon special rules saxon burhs in rounds 12-13, the saxons may choose to build burhs during their increase population phase. each costs 2 pps, only one may be in an area (if destroyed, another may be built), and none may be in difficult terrain. they may build a maximum of burhs equal to 8 minus the number of areas held by them. burhs cannot move, fight as a normal army and counts as a normal army for purposes of population increase, overpopulation, stacking limits, and overruns. in rounds 14-16, if there is a battle involving a burh in which saxons take a loss, the burh must be lost first. round 16: special reinforcements in round 16, the saxons receive special reinforcements, placed on the board at the beginning of round 16 in addition to any armies they receive during the increase population phases of their turns. reinforcements are placed in order of normal play. if there are not enough unused armies, the excess are lost. regardless of whether they receive special reinforcements or not, the saxons perform their increase population phase normally. reinforcing armies depending on the saxons occupy at the end of round 15: 1 for every 2 areas in england (round down) if harold the saxon is in an english area. these armies must be placed in english areas. if harold is not in an english area: no special reinforcements. note: if harold the saxon is not in play at the end of the norman round 15 the normans gain 3 infantry armies. round 16: the king in round 16 only harold, william, harald hardrada, and svein estrithson are eligible to be king (if alive). if all but one of these leaders are dead, the survivor automatically becomes king, unless some nation other than these holds twice as many areas as the prospective king’s nation. in this case no one is king. 10 vps are given for this kingship.4: raider withdrawal raiding armies may withdraw back to the sea area they started the turn in, even if they have used up all their normal movement and engaged in a battle. pick up the raiding armies you are withdrawing and place them in the sea area they started in. 5: overpopulation if a nation has more than twice the number of armies in land areas than it has occupied land areas, it must remove the excess. no area can be emptied, nor can a player remove more armies than are required to end overpopulation. armies at sea (ie. returned to homelands) do not count. the romans are not subject to overpopulation. end of the game round after every nation has taken its turn, perform these steps in order: 1: score for holding areas at the end of as scoring rounds, each nation gains vps for holding the areas indicated on its card. these are in addition to any scored during its nation turn. 2: score for bretwalda or the king at the end of rounds marked by a crown players determine whether any nation has claimed bretwalda or a king. move the marker to the next round on the timeline. leaders some nations receive leaders when indicated on their card and on the timeline. special conditions may need to be met before a leader can be brought into play. a leader whose starting location is not specified is placed on the board at the end of the nation’s increase population phase in any area occupied by the nation’s units. if the leader’s nation has no armies in any land areas, he may not enter play. a leader does not count for purposes of overruns, overpopulation, or stacking limits. a leader may never be in an area without armies of his nation, and must move out with armies that must vacate an area. a leader is removed from the board at the beginning of its nation’s next turn before increase population is calculated. when the angles receive leaders only if they occupy a certain area, a submitted brigante nation occupying the area counts. in either case the leader is not required to appear. the saxon harold, norwegian harald hardrada, and norman william the conqueror all enter play in round 15, and remain in play until the end of the game. winning the game at the end of the game each player adds together the number of vps that each of his nations has scored. the player with the most vps wins. negotiations players may discuss strategy and negotiate agreements only while another player is taking his turn, and no secret negotiations are allowed. no deal can be binding. tracking occupied areas a nation may only score points for occupying a given area once. place the vps that the welsh or norsemen receive for occupying areas over multiple rounds in the area itself, and then later remove them to their card at the end of round 9 for the welsh and the end of round 16 for the norsemen. the norsemen may score vps for holding areas in rounds 13 and 16 even if they have already scored for occupying the areas.the bretwalda at the end of rounds 8-10, vote for a bretwalda of england. each nation must cast 1 vote for each english area it occupies. if brigante has submitted to the angles, brigante-occupied galloway must vote with the angles. any player may call for a secret ballot, to be revealed simultaneously. a nation that gains more than half of the votes cast claims the bretwalda and 4 vps. the king at the end of rounds 11-14, a nation that occupies twice as many areas in england as any other nation (minimum 4) claims kingship of england and gains 8 vps and an infantry unit, placed on the board according to the increase population phase rules. in round 16 only harold, william, harald hardrada, and svein estrithson are eligible to be king (if alive). if all but one of these leaders are dead, the survivor automatically becomes king, unless some nation other than these holds twice as many areas as the prospective king’s nation. in this case no one is king. 10 vps are given for this kingship.welsh special rules submission to roman rule when the welsh occupy 5 areas or fewer, they may submit to roman rule (only during a roman turn and while roman armies are still on the board) after any battle finishes, or after any round of battle, or after any roman movement phase. any roman armies in an area held by a subject nation when submission is declared must move immediately to any adjacent roman-occupied area(s); if there are none, they can move to any adjacent vacant area(s). if after use roman road movement to move farther. if there is no roman-occupied or vacant area adjacent, the armies can be moved to any roman-occupied area(s) adjacent to any area occupied by the submitting nation. if there is still none, they can be moved to any vacant area(s) adjacent to any area occupied by the submitting nation. if none of these apply, the armies are eliminated. submitting has the following effects: 1. in rounds 1-3, the romans immediately gain vps for the areas occupied by the subject nation. the romans may not then later receive vps for occupying those areas (a nation can only score for occupying an area once). however, they may receive vps for the areas held by the subject nation at the end of round 5. 2. the romans can no longer attack the subject nation, and the subjects cannot attack the romans or other roman subjects. 3. subject nations receive only half the usual pps (round up, min. increase 1). however, each turn the roman player may allow subjects to increase population fully. 4. subject nations receive only half vps for holding areas at the end of round 5 (round up). 5. subject nations cannot leave vacant at the end of their move any area they occupy at the beginning of movement unless permitted to do so by the romans. 6. roman armies can move freely through, but not end a turn in, subject areas. subject areas where there is no destroyed roman fort count as having roman roads. submission ends when the romans leave at the start of round 6.dane special rules round 11 in round 11, dane armies must return to the sea area they started their nation turn in. the danes may score vps in round 11 for the areas they occupy; but only for areas they occupy at the start of their raider withdrawal phase. they cannot score for moving through empty areas. in round 12, however, they score vps for occupying certain areas according to the normal rules. round 14: king cnut at the end of the danish turn in round 14, any 4 danish armies plus the leader cnut must be removed from the board. king cnut and his armies are removed in the raider withdrawal phase. kingship is checked immediately prior to this phase. if, when placing the 6 invading danish armies at the beginning of the round, there are not enough armies, the difference is subtracted from the 4 armies that the danes must remove at the end of the danish turn. at the end of the danish turn in round 14, but before the withdrawal, if the danes hold twice as many areas in england as any other nation, and cnut is alive, cnut becomes king and the danes gain 8 vps (no additional army is awarded). there can be 2 kings during round 14. round 16: the king in round 16 only harold, william, harald hardrada, and svein estrithson are eligible to be king (if alive). if all but one of these leaders are dead, the survivor automatically becomes king, unless some nation other than these holds twice as many areas as the prospective king’s nation. in this case no one is king. 10 vps are given for this kingship.4: raider withdrawal raiding armies may withdraw back to the sea area they started the turn in, even if they have used up all their normal movement and engaged in a battle. pick up the raiding armies you are withdrawing and place them in the sea area they started in. 5: overpopulation if a nation has more than twice the number of armies in land areas than it has occupied land areas, it must remove the excess. no area can be emptied, nor can a player remove more armies than are required to end overpopulation. armies at sea (ie. returned to homelands) do not count. the romans are not subject to overpopulation. end of the game round after every nation has taken its turn, perform these steps in order: 1: score for holding areas at the end of as scoring rounds, each nation gains vps for holding the areas indicated on its card. these are in addition to any scored during its nation turn. 2: score for bretwalda or the king at the end of rounds marked by a crown players determine whether any nation has claimed bretwalda or a king. move the marker to the next round on the timeline. leaders some nations receive leaders when indicated on their card and on the timeline. special conditions may need to be met before a leader can be brought into play. a leader whose starting location is not specified is placed on the board at the end of the nation’s increase population phase in any area occupied by the nation’s units. if the leader’s nation has no armies in any land areas, he may not enter play. a leader does not count for purposes of overruns, overpopulation, or stacking limits. a leader may never be in an area without armies of his nation, and must move out with armies that must vacate an area. a leader is removed from the board at the beginning of its nation’s next turn before increase population is calculated. when the angles receive leaders only if they occupy a certain area, a submitted brigante nation occupying the area counts. in either case the leader is not required to appear. the saxon harold, norwegian harald hardrada, and norman william the conqueror all enter play in round 15, and remain in play until the end of the game. winning the game at the end of the game each player adds together the number of vps that each of his nations has scored. the player with the most vps wins. negotiations players may discuss strategy and negotiate agreements only while another player is taking his turn, and no secret negotiations are allowed. no deal can be binding. tracking occupied areas a nation may only score points for occupying a given area once. place the vps that the welsh or norsemen receive for occupying areas over multiple rounds in the area itself, and then later remove them to their card at the end of round 9 for the welsh and the end of round 16 for the norsemen. the norsemen may score vps for holding areas in rounds 13 and 16 even if they have already scored for occupying the areas.the bretwalda at the end of rounds 8-10, vote for a bretwalda of england. each nation must cast 1 vote for each english area it occupies. if brigante has submitted to the angles, brigante-occupied galloway must vote with the angles. any player may call for a secret ballot, to be revealed simultaneously. a nation that gains more than half of the votes cast claims the bretwalda and 4 vps. the king at the end of rounds 11-14, a nation that occupies twice as many areas in england as any other nation (minimum 4) claims kingship of england and gains 8 vps and an infantry unit, placed on the board according to the increase population phase rules. in round 16 only harold, william, harald hardrada, and svein estrithson are eligible to be king (if alive). if all but one of these leaders are dead, the survivor automatically becomes king, unless some nation other than these holds twice as many areas as the prospective king’s nation. in this case no one is king. 10 vps are given for this kingship.belgae special rules submission to roman rule the belgae may submit to roman rule only on roman round 1, if the belgae are reduced to 4 or fewer areas. they unsubmit on their own turn in round 1 before their increase population phase (boudicca’s revolt). their reinforcing army is placed in whichever belgae area boudicca is placed, without regard to stacking limits. the romans score points for submitted belgae areas, and can later build forts in former belgae territory. romans score vps (for their rounds 1-3 occupation) for areas occupied by the belgae when/if the belgae submit in round 1. since the belgae unsubmit in their own turn in round 1, the romans do not score for areas the belgae move into after this, nor do they score limes points for areas held by belgae in round 5. pict special rules pict armies and raiders all pict armies always begin the nation turn on land. on a pict raiding turn, all pict armies are considered to be raiding armies. pict raiders, which do not start at sea, follow the same raider withdrawal procedure as other nations—they withdraw back to the land area they started the turn in. submission to roman rule when the picts occupy 3 areas or fewer, they may submit to roman rule (only during a roman turn and while roman armies are still on the board) after any battle finishes, or after any round of battle, or after any roman movement phase. any roman armies in an area held by a subject nation when submission is declared must move immediately to any adjacent roman-occupied area(s); if there are none, they can move to any adjacent vacant area(s). if after use roman road movement to move farther. if there is no roman-occupied or vacant area adjacent, the armies can be moved to any roman-occupied area(s) adjacent to any area occupied by the submitting nation. if there is still none, they can be moved to any vacant area(s) adjacent to any area occupied by the submitting nation. if none of these apply, the armies are eliminated. submitting has the following effects: 1. in rounds 1-3, the romans immediately gain vps for the areas occupied by the subject nation. the romans may not then later receive vps for occupying those areas (a nation can only score for occupying an area once). however, they may receive vps for the areas held by the subject nation at the end of round 5. 2. the romans can no longer attack the subject nation, and the subjects cannot attack the romans or other roman subjects. 3. subject nations receive only half the usual pps (round up, min. increase 1). however, each turn the roman player may allow subjects to increase population fully. 4. subject nations receive only half vps for holding areas at the end of round 5 (round up). 5. subject nations cannot leave vacant at the end of their move any area they occupy at the beginning of movement unless permitted to do so by the romans. 6. roman armies can move freely through, but not end a turn in, subject areas. subject areas where there is no destroyed roman fort count as having roman roads. submission ends when the romans leave at the start of round 6.angles special rules brigante submission to the angles if the brigantes only occupy 1 or 2 areas in scotland and galloway, they may submit only galloway and brigante-occupied areas in scotland to the angles (even if they occupy other areas outside scotland and galloway). once submitted, no brigante armies may attack the angles; but angles can attack brigante-occupied areas in wales and england (except galloway), and brigantes there will fight back. submitting has the following effects: 1. the angles can score vps at the end of round 7 and round 10 for all brigante-occupied areas and brigantes will score half vps for their areas (round up). 2. the angles can no longer attack the brigantes, and the brigantes cannot attack the angles or other angles subjects. 3. the brigantes receive only half the usual pps (round up, min. increase 1). however, each turn the angle player may allow subjects to increase population fully. 4. the brigantes cannot leave vacant at the end of their move any area they occupy at the beginning of movement unless permitted to do so by the angles. 5. the angles are not allowed to move through brigante- occupied spaces. the bretwalda at the end of rounds 8-10, when voting for a bretwalda of england, if brigante has submitted to the angles, brigante- occupied galloway must vote with the angles. submission ends at the end of round 12, or when all angle armies have been eliminated. norman special rules round 16: special reinforcements in round 16, the normans receive special reinforcements, placed on the board at the beginning of round 16 in addition to any armies they receive during the increase population phases of their turns. reinforcements are placed in order of normal play. if there are not enough unused armies, the excess are lost. regardless of whether they receive special reinforcements or not, nations perform their increase population phase normally. the normans receive reinforcing infantry armies in the english channel, depending on the areas they occupy at the end of round 15: 1 for essex, 1 for wessex, 1 for hwicce, and 1 for south mercia. if harold the saxon is not in play at the end of the norman round 15 they gain 3 infantry armies. they can choose to take cavalry armies at the rate of 1 cavalry in place of 2 infantry. if william is not in play: no special reinforcements. round 16: the king in round 16 only harold, william, harald hardrada, and svein estrithson are eligible to be king (if alive). if all but one of these leaders are dead, the survivor automatically becomes king, unless some nation other than these holds twice as many areas as the prospective king’s nation. in this case no one is king. 10 vps are given for this kingship."
44,805,BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER: THE GAME,2000,HASBRO,2.0065,154,"setup one player is the evil player and the other four play buffy, xander, willow and oz. 4 players: one player is xander & willow. 3 players: one is xander/oz, another is buffy/willow. 2 players: one player controls all good characters. the evil player chooses a villain card which determines goals and servants for the game. place all pawns on their starting spaces and a white or black life token next to the character names on their life tracks. place the buffy talisman on the first new moon space on the phase chart. shuffle and place the weapons, research, help and evil decks on the board. characters take their starting card and evil takes one evil card. take the appropriate special artifact card, remove the other 3, shuffle, and draw 3 artifact cards. shuffle and place these each of these 4 cards face down under a corner of the board. the remaining artifact cards are not used. turn sequence evil starts by rolling the black die. the large flame means the villain can move, and each small flame allows a servant to move. play then proceeds clockwise around the board in this order: oz, xander, willow, then buffy. at the start of a character’s turn the player must roll the 2 blue movement dice. for each moon symbol rolled move the buffy talisman one space clockwise on the phase chart. a character may then perform any or all of the following actions: move play card(s) draw card ends move attempt to recover artifact ends move trade card(s) ends move fight ends turnmovement characters move a number of squares up to the total rolled on the movement dice. characters may not move diagonally or share spaces, and can move through allies but not enemies. a move between manhole covers or tunnels counts as one space. vampires cannot enter blue areas without having a you are invited card. vampires may attack characters inside a house through doorways. demons may go anywhere. good characters cannot pass over or land on the hellmouth. drawing and playing cards characters may draw a card of a matching colour on a space with a coloured circle on it. good characters may have up to 5 cards (show face up) of the types shown on their card holder. the evil player may have up to 4 evil cards (kept secret in the evil card holder). each evil character may also carry an artifact card (kept face down near their life track). the villain keeps his artifact card faceup near the evil card holder. if a player has no empty spot for a card on their card holder, it or the old card must be discarded. cards may be played at any time during a turn unless a time is specified. these cards can only be drawn by the good player: weapons cards are played immediately before rolling fight dice. a character can play only one per turn. research cards are usually spells. the character must roll equal to or greater than the number of majik symbols on their yellow majik die/dice to successfully cast a spell. discard the card in any case. help cards usually allow extra dice on rolls. discard after use. these cards may only be drawn by the evil player: evil cards are discarded after use. when used to summon servants they appear on the hellmouth. artifacts when a character lands on an artifact space, and he/ she does not already have an artifact, roll at least one majik symbol on their yellow majik die/dice to recover the card under that corner of the board. artifacts can only be used by the character holding the artifact card. they cannot be discarded but most may be traded or given to another character. trading cards characters adjacent (not diagonally) to each other may trade, give or receive cards.fighting characters adjacent (not diagonally) may fight. roll the character’s number of red fight dice. punch, kick, jab: each causes 1 point of damage. stake: when trying to destroy a vampire with a wooden weapon, count the number of stakes after resolving damage. an unwounded vampire is dusted with 2 stakes, a wounded vampire with 1. fangs: when rolled by a werewolf, each causes 1 point of damage. when a vampire attacks with a sire a vampire card, count the number of fangs after resolving damage. an unwounded character is sired with 2 fangs, a wounded character with 1. life tracks when a character’s life token moves into the lighter- coloured area of their track, he/she is wounded. when it reaches x the character is dead. all cards are discarded except for artifact cards, which are moved facedown to an empty board corner chosen by the killed character’s player. siring if a vampire successfully sires a good character, flip his/her cardholder to the vamp side, discard all cards except artifacts and set his/her life counter to its highest number. he/she becomes an evil servant. oz cannot be sired. the spell of soul restoration card can turn evil angelus into good angel or make a sired character good again. the player who restored angel’s soul gains control of angel, who takes his turn after the evil player. change his pawn. he can only carry an artifact card. good vampires can again collect cards, cast spells etc. they cannot be ‘re-sired’. the phase chart new moon spaces: evil characters may draw 2 evil cards on an evil space instead of one. full moon spaces: werewolf characters (oz and veruca) transform into their animal state. flip the oz cardholder over to the werewolf side, move his life counter to 15 (13 for veruca) and discard all cards (an artifact card goes to a board corner of choice). oz cannot draw, recover or use any cards but his move roll is doubled. when the full moon ends flip his cardholder back and move his life points to 6 (5 for veruca). sunrise space: all vampires outside must immediately run to the nearest indoor space. vampires take damage equal to the number of spaces it takes to get out of the sunlight. they may not move outside again until the talisman passes sunrise. good vampires are still burned by sunlight. if the sunrise space is moved past in one turn, these effects still take place."
45,14105,COMMAND & COLORS: ANCIENTS,2006,GMT GAMES,2.6903,1043,"setup setup the terrain and unit blocks on the board according to the scenario. review scenario special rules and victory conditions. shuffle the command deck and deal command cards to each side as per the scenario’s war council notes. cards are kept secret from the other player. turn sequence players alternate turns, starting with the player listed in the scenario’s battle notes. 1. command play a command card. 2. order units and leaders announce units you intend to order. 3. move move ordered units, one at a time. 4. battle battle one ordered unit at a time. 5. draw and end of turn draw a new command card. command command cards order units to move and/or battle. the card indicates in which section(s) of the battlefield you may issue orders, and how many units you may order. if the number of units to be ordered is equal to command, this is equal to the number of command cards in the player’s hand (including the one played). order after playing a card, announce which units you intend to order. only units issued an order this turn may move, battle or take a special action. units on a hex straddling two sections may be ordered from either section. only one order may be given to each unit or leader per turn. if a card allows you to issue more orders than you have units in that section, the additional orders are lost. movement move units one at a time and only once per ordered unit per turn. movement for one unit must be completed before moving another. an ordered unit does not have to move. two units may not occupy the same hex, and—with some exceptions—units may not move into or through occupied hexes. terrain may impact movement. blocks always stay together as a unit and cannot combine with other units. a unit may move into a hex with a solitary friendly leader, but must stop there.combat resolve battles one at a time and, normally, only once per ordered unit per turn. one unit’s battle (either ranged or close combat) must be completed before the next battle. an ordered unit does not have to battle (with the exception of warriors moving 2 hexes). a unit always fights at the same strength despite casualties (with the exception of warriors). ranged combat only units armed with missile weapons may attack in ranged combat at unit more than 1 hex away. ranged combat may not be used against adjacent enemy units. a unit adjacent to an enemy unit must engage it in close combat if it chooses to battle (it cannot target a more distant unit). the target must be within range. count the number of hexes to the target (not counting the attacker’s hex but counting the target’s hex) and verify that the distance is within the weapon’s range. the target must be within line of sight. draw a line between the centres of the hexes; line of sight is blocked if any part of a hex containing an obstruction, unit or leader crosses this line. if the line runs along the edge of one or more hexes it is only blocked if the obstructions stand somewhere along both sides of the line. roll battle dice. if the unit did not move prior to firing roll 2 dice; if it moved, roll 1 die. a target cannot evade a ranged combat attack or battle back afterwards. leaders do not affect ranged combat. close combat a unit attacking an adjacent unit is in close combat. it cannot use ranged combat against the adjacent unit or any other unit within range. some units are eligible to evade. roll battle dice. the number of dice rolled depends on unit type. battle dice effects green, blue or red symbol: one hit on units with the matching circle symbol. flag: no hit, but target may retreat. leader helmet: see below. sword ranged: no effect sword close combat: one hit on any unit. for each hit, one block is removed from the target unit. war machine units, and green circled units without a white border (light infantry, light sling infantry, light bow infantry, light cavalry, and light bow cavalry) do not score a hit on a sword symbol. chariot units ignore 1 sword hit. elephant units ignore all sword hits and ignore 1 red square hit from cavalry or chariots. camel units ignore 1 blue triangle hit from cavalry or chariots. one hit is scored for each leader helmet symbol rolled in close combat, if a friendly leader is attached or adjacent to any friendly non-elephant unit battling /battling back. a leader alone in a hex attacked by ranged or close combat is hit on the roll of a leader symbol. when present, terrain battle dice reductions reduce the number of dice rolled accordingly. battling back in close combat, a defending unit may battle back against an attacker if they survived and did not retreat, or was unable to fulfill a required retreat. retreats for each flag symbol rolled against a target unit, it must move 1 movement (the maximum number of hexes it may move when given an order) back towards its own side of the battlefield. terrain has no effect on retreat moves, though impassable terrain is still impassable. units may not retreat into or through a hex containing another unit. an attached leader must retreat with its unit. a unit without a leader may retreat into a hex with an unattached friendly leader; the retreat move then stops. if a unit’s unit retreat path is blocked, 1 figure is removed for each retreat hex of movement that cannot be completed. bolster morale a unit can ignore 1 flag when a leader attached to the unit survives any leader casualty check. a unit adjacent to at least 2 friendly units (a leader alone in a hex is considered a supporting unit) may ignore 1 flag. elephants may act as a support unit, but may not receive support from units or leaders. some terrain allows a defending unit to ignore 1 flag. full-strength warrior units may ignore 1 flag. effects are cumulative. evade a unit attacked in close combat may attempt to evade. an attacking unit may not evade if the defender battles back, and evading units may never battle back.the attacker rolls the correct number of dice, but only symbols matching the evading unit’s symbol score a hit. an evade move is a 2 hex move towards the unit’s side of the battlefield. if only 1 hex is available, the unit may move only 1 hex. green units and war machine units may always evade. medium cavalry and camel units may evade all foot and heavy mounted units. heavy cavalry and heavy chariot units may evade all foot and elephant units. auxilia, medium infantry, warrior, heavy infantry and elephant units may never evade. a leader alone in a hex must evade. if a war machine unit evades it is removed from the battlefield but does not count as a victory banner. momentum advance when a unit attacks in close combat and eliminates the enemy unit or forces it to retreat from its hex, it may advance into the vacated hex. a cavalry unit may advance and then, optionally, may move one additional hex. momentum advance is not allowed if the defender evades a close combat attack, or the hex was vacated by an evading leader. a unit ordered by a first strike card cannot momentum advance, but the targeted unit remains eligible for momentum advance and possible bonus close combat. a unit battling back, or a war machine unit, cannot momentum advance. bonus close combat after a successful close combat, some units making a momentum advance are eligible for an optional bonus close combat against any enemy unit in an adjacent hex. units that can make a bonus close combat after a momentum advance: warrior units. a non-warrior unit with an attached leader (except for war machines). a camel, cavalry, chariot or elephant unit. if the bonus attack is successful and eliminates or pushes back the target, the attacker may then advance into the vacated hex but not battle again this turn. a cavalry unit can only move into the vacated hex, not move one additional hex. some terrain restrictions prevent this movement. draw and end of turn discard the command card played this turn and draw another. if the draw deck runs out of cards, the discards are shuffled to form a new deck. players alternate turns until one player reaches the required number of victory banners, at which time the game immediately ends.leaders leaders and units a leader in the same hex as a friendly unit is attached to that unit. if the unit moves, the leader must move with it (this costs only one command). when a card with a helmet symbol is played, one or more attached leaders may detach from a unit and move independently at a cost of one order each. leader movement when moving by himself a leader may move, once per turn, up to 3 hexes, and may move through friendly units. only one leader may occupy a hex. when a leader moves into a hex with another unit, he may not move again with the unit he has just joined. leaders in combat a leader may not attack if he is alone in a hex. one hit is scored for each leader helmet symbol rolled in close combat, if a friendly leader is attached or adjacent to any friendly non-elephant unit battling /battling back. leaders do not affect ranged combat. a unit can ignore 1 flag when a leader attached to the unit survives any leader casualty check. any non-warrior foot unit to which a leader is attached may make a bonus close combat attack after a momentum advance (except for war machine units). leader casualty checks a leader casualty check is made when a unit to which a leader is attached loses one or more blocks due to ranged combat, close combat, evading, failure to complete a retreat move, elephant rampage, or blocking an elephant unit’s retreat. roll 2 dice: to hit the leader, roll 2 leader symbols. if the unit to which a leader is attached is eliminated, roll 1 die: to hit the leader, roll 1 leader symbol. if the leader is not hit, he must evade. flags rolled against an eliminated unit have no effect on the leader. the attacking unit may momentum advance after close combat onto the vacated hex after the leader is eliminated or evades. if a leader alone in a hex is attacked by ranged or close combat, the attacker rolls its normal number of dice and scores a hit by rolling one leader symbol. if the leader is not hit he must evade. flags rolled against a leader alone in a hex have no effect. only one leader casualty check is made per combat dice roll. the attacking unit may not momentum advance after close combat onto the vacated hex after the lone leader is eliminated or evades. leader evade a leader’s evade move is up to 3 hexes towards his side of the battlefield. if a leader cannot evade a minimum of 1 hex he is eliminated. he may move through a hex that contains a friendly unit or friendly leader, but may not end his move in any hex containing a friendly leader, impassable terrain, or enemy leader or unit. if he ends his move with a friendly unit, he is attached to that unit. you may choose to evade your leader off your side of the battlefield, thus denying the victory banner to your opponent. leader escape if enemy units occupy 1 or 2 hexes of a leader’s evade path, he must attempt to escape through those hexes. move the leader onto one of the enemy hexes and allow the enemy unit to battle the leader (who does not benefit from terrain). 1 leader symbol must be rolled to score a hit. if he is not hit, the leader continues with his evade move into the next hex, which may also be occupied, in which case he can be attacked again. elephants elephant combat each sword symbol an elephant unit rolls in close combat scores a hit, then each of these dice is rolled again for possible additional hits. keep rolling until you get no more sword symbols. an elephant unit ignores all sword hits rolled against it in close combat, and receives no close combat or morale benefits from an attached leader or one in an adjacent hex. an elephant unit in close combat with a cavalry or chariot unit may ignore 1 red square hit and one flag. cavalry or chariots forced to retreat must retreat 1 additional hex for each flag rolled against them. elephant retreat (rampage) before a retreating elephant is moved, all units and any lone leaders in adjacent hexes must check to see if they are trampled. roll 2 dice for each hex with a unit or lone leader (your opponent rolls for hits on your units, and you roll for hits on his units). a hit is scored when the symbol rolled matches the unit type; other symbols are ignored. after the rampage, the elephant completes its retreat movement. if the path is occupied by friendly or enemy units, or a lone enemy leader, the elephant is not moved back and does not lose any blocks. instead, the units or leader must each lose one block for each hex of its retreat that the elephant was unable to fulfill. camels a camel unit in close combat with a cavalry or chariot unit may ignore 1 blue triangle hit. cavalry or chariots forced to retreat must retreat 1 additional hex for each

46,40270,CALL OF CTHULHU: THE CARD GAME,2008,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,2.8945,218,"setup shuffle the decks (in tournament play, a deck must contain at least 50 cards not counting story cards and domains, and not more of 3 per card title) and place the board between the players. place all the success and wound tokens in ‘the deep’ area of the board. shuffle the story cards and place 3 faceup on the centre spaces. place the remainder facedown in the story deck space. each player takes 3 unused cards and places them facedown next to his deck as domains, then draws 8 cards from his deck as his setup hand. attach one card, faceup and upside down (with the resource icon visible), to each domain as starting resources. on the first turn the starting player (determine randomly) may draw only one card in his draw phase, and skips his entire story phase. cards there are 5 different types of cards: story, character, support, event, and conspiracy. cards belong either to one of the 8 factions (the agency, miskatonic university, the syndicate, silver twilight, cthulhu, hastur, yog sothoth, and shub niggurath) or are neutral (grey border and no symbol). card names marked with (•) are unique; each player may have only one copy in play at one time. a card put into play is normally in the ready position: faceup in front of the player. when a card is used it is turned 90º sideways and exhausted. it cannot be used again until restored in the refresh phase. a character card that goes insane is flipped facedown. cards that are attached to another card are destroyed (put into the discard pile) when that card leaves play. turn sequence a player’s turn is divided into 5 phases in order: 1. refresh phase choose and restore one insane character by flipping it faceup and exhausting it (placing it sideways). ready (turn upright) any of your exhausted cards in play (except the one just restored) and refresh drained domains by removing tokens on them. 2. draw phase draw 2 cards from your deck. 3. resource phase you may choose one card from your hand and attach it, faceup and upside down, to one of your domains as a resource. there is no limit to the number of resources that can be attached to a domain. a resource is no longer part of your hand and cannot be used for anything else. 4. operations phase you may play character and support cards from your hand, ready and faceup in front of you. to play a card, or activate certain card effects, you must pay for it by draining a domain with sufficient resources (place a token on the domain). unless the card is neutral, at least one of the attached resources must match that card’s faction (a resource match). cards with a cost of 0 do not require a domain to be drained or a resource match. triggering an ability from a card in play does not usually require a resource match. you can never drain more than 1 domain to pay for a card, and extra resources paid are lost. once drained, the domain cannot be drained again until refreshed by card effects or during the resource phase. 5. story phase 1. active player commits you may commit ready characters to the story cards by exhausting them and moving them up to the card(s). each character may only be committed to one story. if you do not commit at least one character, the phase ends and your turn is over. 2. opponent commits your opponent may then commit ready characters to any story to which at least one character has been committed. 3. stories are resolved in an order chosen by the active player, each story card with committed characters is resolved with 4 icon struggles followed by comparing skill values. 1. terror struggle 2. combat struggle 3. arcane struggle 4. investigation struggle 5. determine success after a story has been resolved, characters committed to that story return to their controller’s play area, retaining their current status of readied or exhausted. end of turn players have one more chance to take actions, and then all characters are uncommitted from their story cards. play then passes to the other player.resolving a story card to resolve an icon struggle, the player with the most of that icon wins the struggle and immediately exercises its effect. in a tie, nothing happens. icon boosters force additional icon struggles of that type (but do not count as icons). terror struggle the losing player must choose one of his characters committed to that story to go insane. that character is no longer considered committed to the story. characters with a icon or the willpower keyword can never go insane or be chosen to go insane. combat struggle the losing player must choose one of his characters committed to that story to take a wound. most characters are discarded after taking a single wound. those with the toughness keyword may take additional wounds before being destroyed. arcane struggle the winning player may ready any one of his characters committed to that story. the character does not need to have the icon. investigation struggle the winning player may immediately place a success token on the story card. if he wins that story card, he takes it and immediately resolves its effects. determine success the active player then determines if he has been successful. add the combined skill values of all your characters not destroyed or driven insane and currently committed to the story. if this total skill exceeds your opponent’s (it must be 1 or higher), you may place a success token on your side of the story. if you succeed and the total skill of your opponent was 0 or less, you may place an additional token. if the non-active player has the most total skill, nothing happens. winning a story card if at any time you have 5 or more tokens on your side of a story card you take it and may choose to execute its effect. all success tokens on the card are discarded and the card is replaced by a new card from the story deck. if multiple story cards are won at the same time, the active player chooses the order in which they are won; if players simultaneously win, the active player wins it. conspiracy cards conspiracy cards are played from the active player’s hand during his operations phase, entering the game as new story cards, in addition to the 3 in play. they can also be attached to a domain as a resource, as normal."
47,10496,CAMELOT LEGENDS,2004,Z-MAN GAMES,2.3261,138,"3. complete location events the active player checks to see if any of his companies have met the requirements for any location events (lower right hand corner of location event card) and if so, takes the event and places it in his victory display area in full view. a player may complete several location events per turn as long as each one is at a different location. the characters at that location must possess combined ability scores in the appropriate abilities that equal or exceed the listed requirements. if 2 different abilities are listed, both requirements need to be fulfilled. 4. 2 card actions the active player performs 2 of the following actions in any order (or the same action twice): draw a character: draw a new character from the character deck and add it to your hand. a character with a shield in the upper left corner is a knight, and the shield indicates the knight’s allegiance. a player’s hand limit is 5 cards, and cards may not be voluntarily discarded. play a character: play a character card from your hand to a location on the table. a player must spend 2 actions to play a lord of camelot. a group of characters belonging to the same player at the same location is called a company. there is a company limit of 6 characters per location for each player. move 1 or 2 characters: move 1 or 2 characters from one location to any other location, as long as the company limit is not exceeded. 2 characters moved together as part of the same action must begin and end their movement together. special cards there are three special cards: the high king, excalibur, and the love potion. when a character receives a special card (usually as the result of an event), place it beneath the character so the title and text of the special card can still be seen. that character now gains the card’s special ability. additionally, the player who controls the character earns bonus victory points if that character is still in possession of the card by the end of the game. if the character is discarded or returned to a player’s hand during the game, return the special card to the main playing area, face up. if another character is instructed to obtain the same special card, the current owner must surrender control of the card. when a character obtains the high king special card, the player controlling that character gains a third card action whenever that character is at camelot. the bonus action is acquired as soon as the character becomes the high king at camelot (or whenever that character moves to camelot from another location). the bonus action is lost as soon as the character loses the title or moves away from camelot. note that the character can choose to move away from camelot as his third action. winning the game when the final event is drawn, it is placed face up beside the main playing area and treated it as a special location where characters can be played and moved. note that card text using the term main location refers only to camelot, cornwall, and the perilous forest, not special locations. as soon as the final event is resolved, the game ends. the game can end even while unresolved location events remain elsewhere on the table. all characters scheduled to be discarded at the end of the turn (as well as any special cards placed on those characters) are removed before victory points are totaled. each player now adds up the points in his victory display and on any special cards his characters still possess. the player with the most victory points wins the game.setup place the 3 location cards and the 3 special cards face up in the main playing area. icons on the location cards indicate the abilities which are the most useful at those locations. shuffle the 3 final events and place 1 of them face down in the main playing area. shuffle the main event deck (including white, blue and if desired, red icon events) and stack a number of event cards on top of the final event card as follows: 2 players: 17 events; 3 players: 20 events; 4 players: 23 events. the remaining event cards and the 2 final events are permanently removed, unexamined, from play. shuffle the character cards and deal 5 to each player as their starting hands, then place the remainder in a face down stack beside the event deck. shuffle together one reference card for each player, including the card with the pendragon symbol. deal each player a face up card. the player with the pendragon symbol will go first. each player chooses either blue, red, yellow, or green—this is the side of the locations where each player will play his characters during the game. starting with the first player and continuing clockwise, each player now plays play 2 regular characters (to either one or two locations) or one lord of camelot, beside the appropriately colored side of the location(s) of his choice. sequence of play 1. draw event card the active player must draw the top event card. special events are resolved immediately and discarded. location events are placed face up on their corresponding location, beside any other events already there, to a maximum of 3 events. events exceeding this number are discarded. heraldic events are placed in the play area, covering any previous heraldic events. they give a bonus to a specified ability to the knights of one allegiance. bidding events the player drawing the event decides whether to bid 1 character face up (from his hand or one of his companies on the table) or to pass. the player to his left now decides whether to bid 1 character or pass, and so on clockwise. when the bid returns to a player who previously passed, that player can now choose to bid a character, or to pass again. bidding continues one character at a time until all players have passed consecutively or all players have bid the maximum number of characters as specified on the bidding event. the player that bid the characters with the highest combined total in the event’s specified abilities wins the bidding event. character optional text cannot be used to boost ability scores. all characters bid to the event are discarded. if there is a tie, the bidding event is discarded along with all the characters bid. a player need not bid the maximum number of characters in order to complete a bidding event. if no one bids any characters at all, discard the bidding event and proceed with the game. 2. use optional card text card text including the work ‘may’ is optional and can only be used once per turn in this phase (or, in special circumstances, during your opponent’s turn). the threat icon indicates that the character possesses an ability that may allow him to discard an opponent’s character at the same location. the romance icon indicates that the character possesses an abilty that may allow her to affect an opponent’s male character at the same location."
48,57390,CATACOMBS,2010,ELZRA,1.9565,207,"setup one player is the overseer and the other players control heroes: 5 players: 4 players control 1 hero each; 4 players: 2 players control 1 hero each and 1 player controls 2 heroes; 3 players: 2 players control 2 heroes each; 2 players: 1 player control 4 heroes. as a group, the players choose which 4 heroes and which catacomb lord (from weakest to strongest: sorcerer, gorgon, lich lord and dragon) will be used in the game. players take a hero player board for each hero they control and take the corresponding wooden hero piece and cards. heroes have a minimum of a portrait card which shows their name and class and a rules card which shows any starting health, base shot sequence, any ability, spell and/or item cards the hero starts the game with, any special rules, and whether the hero can use weapons and/or magic items. place cards in the spaces that have icons that match the card backs. there are also spaces to place poison cards and ally rules cards. put a health tracker on the blood drop of the hero health track indicated by the starting health on your hero rules card. when a hero gains or loses health points, the health tracker is moved up or down the track. unfold and connect the 4 barrier walls and place them on the table. all other components are placed outside of the walls. the space between the board and the walls is the shadow realm. the overseer takes the catacomb lord player mat, matching catacomb lord piece and associated cards (portrait, setup and rules card). place the devoured! and teleported! cards faceup near the overseer, along with the shuffled item and poison card decks. the monster pieces are placed near the overseer to form the monster pool, and the wooden gold coins beside them to form the treasury. inexperienced players should start the game with 5 gold. missile, shield, fireball and ice shot pieces are shared by all players. when a shot sequence using one of these pieces is completed, return it to the side of the board. the overseer sorts the room cards into 3 decks by level (0, 1 or 2). shuffle each deck and place, facedown in a vertical column face down next to one side of the barrier walls, one card of each type in the following order, starting from the top (the card closest to the heroes): level 0 > level 1 > merchant > level 1 > level 1 > healer > level 2 > catacomb lord’s lair remaining room cards are returned to the box. the overseer is the final arbiter of any disputes that may arise during the game. the supply of pieces and cards are hard limits in the game: if there are no more coins in the treasury, heroes don’t collect any gold during the resolution phase; if there is no monster of a particular type available in the monster pool, the overseer cannot use that monster.game round 1. exploration the overseer flips the next unrevealed room card, starting from the top (the card closest to the heroes). if the heroes have reached the catacomb lord’s lair special room card, the final battle begins. 2. setup the overseer chooses a board and places it on the table, centered within the barrier walls. the same side of a board cannot be used for 2 consecutive rooms except in the case of the catacomb lord’s board (shown on the catacomb lord setup card). place the large dark brown obstacle pieces in the holes in the board. the overseer finds the monster cards for each monster displayed on the room card, and places them beside the board for the players to examine. the overseer gathers the appropriate type and number of monster pieces to be used from the monster pool, and places these monsters pieces in any legal location in the monster start zone (indicated by a catacomb lord icon). the players then place their hero, ally or familiar pieces anywhere behind the line delineating the hero start zone (indicated by a hero icon). the room is now ready to play. 3. battle players take their turns by performing one action for each hero. there is no set order for which hero goes first: players should decide who should perform their action next. an action is either a hero’s basic shot sequence (on the hero’s rules card), or playing an item, spell or ability card, but not both (unless rules on a card override this condition or a hero is using a combo item). once all the players have performed an action with the heroes, the overseer takes a turn for each monster (the shot sequences described on their monster cards). once all the monsters have taken a turn, the round is over. at the end of the round, the heroes assess any additional end of round effects that may have occurred. a new round then begins with the heroes taking their turns again. rounds continue until all the monsters in the room have been frozen and/or destroyed or all the heroes are dead. surviving heroes are freed from the devoured! and teleported! cards and if stunned or bitten return to their normal state. 4. resolution the resolution phase begins if at least 1 hero survived the battle phase. each hero takes an amount of gold equal to the total value of the monsters they destroyed during the battle phase. a monster’s gold value is on its monster card. the monster pieces are then returned to the monster pool. after the resolution phase is complete, go to the next round’s exploration phase. shots basic shot types melee shot: the most basic shot type, performed by shooting the appropriate piece with the controlling player’s finger across the board. an unmodified melee shot does 1 point of damage. rush shot: performed exactly like a melee shot, however no damage is inflicted. bite shot: performed exactly like a melee shot, but inflicts 2 points of damage. if a piece leaves the board as the result of any shot, place it back on the edge of the board at the point where it left. if a shot results in a piece ending up on top of another piece (including obstacles), the player who took the shot moves it to the nearest possible location on the board where it is able to lay completely flat. a piece must always end a shot in a legal location on the board. ranged shot types all ranged shot types use a separate wooden piece, placed anywhere within 2.5 cm (1"") of the hero, monster, ally or catacomb lord and then shot across the board. a basic missile shot inflicts 1 point of damage if it hits a target and is removed from the board when the shot is completed. fireball: use the fireball piece. giant fireball: use the giant fireball piece, and a successful hit does 2 points of damage. boulder: use the giant boulder piece, and a successful hit does 3 points of damage. ice use the ice piece, and a successful hit does no damage but instead freezes the target. place the ice shot piece on top of the affected monster piece. catacomb lords cannot be frozen by the ice shot. a frozen monster remains in place, cannot take any of its actions, does not take damage, and its defensive properties are suspended. it can only be freed when the ice shot piece is knocked off by another shot (directly or indirectly). immediately remove the ice shot piece from the board when it is knocked off. if 2 monsters are hit by an ice shot, only one is affected (the player performing the shot decides which). if all other monsters in the room are dead and any remain frozen, the room is complete. the player who froze the monster collects gold as if they destroyed it. target: enables a second attempt at a missed shot. the target must be declared prior to the first shot. if the target is not hit, a second shot may be taken from the last legal position where the first shot ended. the target shot inflicts 1 point of damage to the stated target only; damage to other characters is ignored. shield shots: these function identically to missile shots, but the shield piece does no damage. you may flick it from its current position, or place it beside the character and flick it as normal. after the entire shot sequence is finished, place the shield piece within 2.5 cm (1”) of the shield’s owner. shield pieces are removed from the game when their owner dies or the battle phase ends. shot sequences a shot sequence is when multiple shots can be performed in a row and is identified by a then icon between each shot. when you must choose which shot or shot sequence to perform from two possible alternatives this is identified by the or icon between the shot icons. you must declare which shot you are choosing before performing it. if, for any reason, you cannot perform part of your shot sequence, that part is ignored and you move on to the next part. however, you must complete all parts of a given shot sequence if you are able to do so.shot modifiers basic shot types are shown as a white icon on a black circle. when a modifier applies, the shot icon is a different colour . shot modifiers can be applied to rush shots: a hit target suffers no damage as normal, but the modifier’s effect is applied. chain (yellow): the same target cannot be damaged consecutively in a shot sequence; if the same target is hit consecutively, damage from the additional hits is ignored. ranged shots with the chain modifier always originate from the location of the character performing them. corrosion (brown): if a hero is hit with a corrosion shot modifier, one of their item cards is destroyed. shuffle the affected hero’s item cards, draw one randomly, discard it from the game, and remove its associated pieces. if the hero does not have any item cards, they lose 3 gold coins instead. critical (red): increase the damage inflicted by the base shot by 1 point. fear (white): the attacker who damages a target with the fear shot modifier may immediately perform a single, unmodifiable rush shot with that target hero (even if they are stunned), ally, familiar or monster piece. catacomb lords and antients are not affected. petrify (gray): the hit character is turned to stone and is immediately out of the game, no matter its health. if 2 characters are hit, only one is affected (all characters still take damage); the player performing the shot decides which. catacomb lords and antients are not affected. poison (green): a hero or stunned hero hit by a poison shot modifier loses 1 health point (rush shots do not inflict damage). then, draw the appropriate number of poison cards from the poison deck and place them faceup on the hero’s player mat. if at any time, the total value of all a hero’s accumulated poison cards equals or exceeds their starting health, they die. if no poison cards are left in the poison deck, the affected hero is has been hit with a lethal dose and dies. regeneration (pink): a character may restore 1 point of health after successfully damaging an enemy. only 1 point of health is restored even if multiple targets are damaged. the regeneration shot modifier is ineffective against shadow monsters as they are not damaged in the normal way. stun (blue): when hit, place the stunned! card over the hero’s rules card (or flip the hero piece to its stunned side). on the player’s turn, you may only perform a single rush shot with a stunned hero until that hero is hit directly by any melee or rush shot from one of their teammates (including another stunned hero). remove the card or flip the hero piece back to its normal state when this happens. when the battle phase for a room ends, all stunned heroes return to normal. if a stunned hero has a familiar in play, the player controlling the hero can still perform the familiar’s action. no spells can be cast from a raven familiar’s location while its owner is stunned. if a hero is stunned and all others are dead, the effects of the stun modifier are ignored. transform (purple): when a monster with the transform shot modifier inflicts damage, it transforms into the form indicated. after a fire spirit performs this shot and damages one of the heroic forces, flip its piece to become a fire wall. it remains in this form for the remainder of the room and is treated like an obstacle (fire walls cannot be controlled further by the overseer and do not count as monsters). the fire wall inflicts 1 point of damage to any heroic piece that comes into contact with it in any way, directly or indirectly. a fire wall pushed off the board returns to the point where it departed, as normal.defensive properties characters with defensive properties can automatically prevent damage from specific shots and shot modifier effects. nullifying shots: some characters can nullify basic shots which prevents any damage from being inflicted and any shot modifiers from taking effect (the modifiers are ignored). reflecting shots: reflected shots behave the same way as nullified shots, in addition to 1 (and only 1) point of damage being reflected back at the attacker initiating the shot. when a nullifies or reflects box appears on an antient card, a catacomb lord rules card, a hero rules card, a monster card or an item card with the permanent frequency condition, all shot icons in that box are nullified and/or reflected automatically. when a nullifies or reflects box appears on an ability card or an item card with the once per room frequency condition, the player affected by a given shot may choose when to use the card to be protected; after which the card is flipped over. refresh the card (flip it faceup) during the setup phase of the next room. when a nullifies or reflects box appears on a spell card or and item card with the once per game frequency condition, the player affected by a given shot must choose when to use the card to be protected; after which the card is discarded. hits, damage & character death a character loses health points each time they are damaged; either from being directly hit with character or ranged shot pieces, or some other special damage effect. when a hero’s shot successfully hits a monster piece, that monster takes damage. when you kill a monster piece, remove it from the board and place it on your hero player board. multiple targets can be damaged by a single shot if the shot hits them directly, and a character may simultaneously damage 2 targets adjacent to each other. if a hero’s melee shot strikes a piece that is then pushed into a another piece, no damage is inflicted on the latter piece because the hero did not damage it directly. when a hero, ally, level 4 monster or catacomb lord is damaged, move the marker on the corresponding health track of their player mat down the required number of blood drops. if a hero’s health track reaches the skull icon, they are dead and all pieces under their control are removed from the board. that hero is out of the game unless the remaining heroes reach althea the healer and resurrect the dead hero. if a monster with 2 health points (as shown on its monster card) takes 1 point of damage, it is flipped over in place on the board, showing the side of the piece with a black background. one more successful hit destroys a monster in this damaged state. heroes, allies and familiars cannot damage each other in any way, nor can monsters and catacomb lords damage each other. healing healing can restore a hero or ally’s health. in addition to visiting althea the healer or the alewife tavern, when heal icons appear on a card, a character increases their health according to the number of heal icons present. heal all: this icon enables all living teammates (including the character performing the healing) to recover 1 point of health. a character’s health can never exceed its starting value.battle room cards battle room cards show the overseer how to populate a room with monsters. each card has a room name and level (with level 0 rooms the easiest and level 2 rooms the most challenging). four quadrants group the monsters to be placed on the board during the setup phase by their level (1 to 4). monsters are represented in 3 ways: specific monster icons: the specific monster and number of pieces to be used. mercenary monster icons: check the current catacomb lord’s setup card to see which level 1 monster should be used when a mercenary monster icon appears in the room card’s top left quadrant. monster metre icons: for each monster metre icon, a monster of the specified level from any family (colour) can be chosen. the overseer also decides how many pieces available for that monster are placed in the monster start zone (usually all of them). in some cases, the overseer should not deploy all the monster pieces available for a specific monster; if a monster is used in summon shots, the overseer may want to hold 1 or more pieces back in the monster pool, enabling that monster to be summoned later during the battle phase. suppression restrictions on what types of shots and/or shot modifiers may be used in a room by both heroic forces and the overseer are shown in a suppression box. if an unmodified shot is listed, it means that shot type and all its modified versions are suppressed for the duration of that room. if a specific modified shot is listed, only the modifier is suppressed, not the basic shot. ability, spell & item cards ability cards ability cards are specific to a particular hero and can only be used once during the battle phase of a room. after it has been used, an ability card is flipped facedown to indicate this and is refreshed (flipped faceup) during the setup phase of the next room. when played, a card’s effects only apply to the card’s owner unless the hero icon appears on the card. in that case, the player controlling that hero can choose to apply the effect to the owner of the card, or another hero or ally. spell cards spell cards can only be used by spell casters. a spell card can only be played once per game and once used is discarded permanently. item cards item cards are purchased from izchak the merchant or won at the alewife tavern. most items can be used by any hero, but there are some which are restricted to a specific hero or only those heroes who can wield weapons, for example. these restrictions are listed on the card. item cards are either played once per game, once per room, or are considered permanent. there is no restriction as to how many items a hero can carry. items cannot be used when a hero is stunned unless the item is a familiar. only the hero who owns the item may use it and items cannot be given away or traded. allies cannot buy or use items. when a hero starts the game equipped with items, the player controlling the hero is not obligated to take them. restrictions on which heroes can use which items are detailed on the item cards: any hero: some items are available to any hero. specific hero: some items can only be purchased and used by specific heroes. specific conditions: some items can only be used by heroes with a specific condition, for example a certain amount of starting health. heroes that can wield weapons: items that are weapons are identified with the icon. this also appears on the hero rules card if a hero is able to purchase and wield weapons. means a hero cannot purchase and wield weapons. heroes that can cast spells: magic items can only be bought and used by heroes who can cast spells and are identified with the icon. this also appears on the hero rules card if a hero is able to cast spells. means a hero cannot cast spells. hero specific enhancements some heroes are more proficient at using certain items. a hero’s face on an item card identifies an enhanced shot sequence that is only available to them when using that particular item. frequency conditions there are 3 types of condition for how many times an item can be used during the game. 1. once per game: the item can only be used once during the game (typically during the battle phase) and is then discarded and cannot be acquired or used again. 2. once per room: the item can be used once every battle phase and is flipped facedown to represent this. the item card is refreshed faceup in the setup phase. 3. permanent: once acquired, the item is always in play and does not require a specific action to take effect. combo items a combo item can be played either immediately before or immediately after a hero’s normal turn. this is indicated in the item’s shot sequence by the ‘...’ icon before or after the icon. only 1 combo item card may be played per turn either before or after the hero’s action. familiars all heroes can purchase and use familiar items provided they fulfill the conditions appropriate to a given familiar. in the setup phase, the familiar is placed within 2.5 cm (1"") of the hero who controls it. the player can choose whether the hero or familiar performs their action first. the familiar performs its shot sequence every round until it dies or until the room is cleared. it stays with the hero for the entire game, returning to its owner’s side in the setup phase of every room. familiars are used to help heroes but they cannot earn gold for directly destroying monsters (their owners do not receive any gold). familiars cannot be poisoned or stunned; but can be devoured and teleported. a hero can only have a maximum of 1 familiar item. if the hero controlling a familiar is stunned, bitten or devoured, then the hero cannot take an action (as normal); however, the familiar is still able to do so. when a hero dies, their familiar is removed from the board and is also out of the game (along with their other items). if a familiar dies during the battle phase, it is removed from the board but rejoins its owner in the setup phase of the next room. monster cards there are 5 monster families: dungeon (green), infernal (orange), mythological (blue), undead (gray) and vermin (beige). shadow monsters come from the shadow realm (the space between the board and barrier walls). instead of a solid blood health drop icon on their monster cards, they have a dotted one. they cannot be killed by inflicting normal damage; instead they must be pushed by any direct shot completely off the board, thus returning them to the shadow realm. poison cards there are 3 ways for heroes to cure themselves of poison: 1. playing cure poison spell cards (during the battle phase of any room, the wizard may play these cards to cure himself or another hero). 2. visiting althea the healer for her cure poison service. 3. testing luck at the alewife tavern. the hero may discard 1 poison card of their choice (0 - 5), which is immediately shuffled back into the poison deck. refreshing ability or item cards when a refresh ability or refresh item icon appears in a shot sequence, one of the hero’s ability or item cards that has been used can be refreshed (flipped faceup) so it can be played again on a later turn. only once per room item cards can be refreshed. the final battle when the heroes arrive at the catacomb lord’s lair special room card during the exploration phase, the final battle begins. the overseer controls the catacomb lord like any other monster. each catacomb lord has 3 cards, placed on the catacomb lord player mat: a portrait card, a setup card, and a rules card. the setup card list the catacomb lord’s starting health, which board to be used during the final battle, the type and number of minions to be placed in the monster start zone in the battle phase of the catacomb lord special room along with the catacomb lord piece, and the catacomb lord’s mercenary monster. the rules card shows the shot sequences that can be performed by the catacomb lord. only one of the shot sequences shown may be performed per round of the battle phase. if the heroes reduce the catacomb lord’s health track to 0 and at least 1 hero in the party remains alive, the heroes and win the game. it is not necessary to destroy all the catacomb lord’s minions to win; only the catacomb lord itself must be destroyed. monster vulnerabilities (optional) these optional vulnerabilities for new players do not override any defensive properties that individual monsters may have. dungeon (green) monsters are vulnerable to missiles: treat any unmodified missile shot from heroes as having the critical modifier. infernal (orange) monsters are vulnerable to the ice shot: their health is reduced by 1 extra point in addition to being frozen. mythological (blue) monsters are vulnerable in hand-to-hand combat: treat any unmodified melee shot from the heroes as having the regeneration modifier. undead (gray) are vulnerable to the fireball shot: treat any unmodified fireball shot from the heroes as having the critical modifier, unless the target has a shot with the fear modifier in its sequence. undead also take 1 point of damage when hitting, or being pushed into, fire walls and fire obstacles. vermin (beige) are susceptible to fear: treat any unmodified melee or missile shot from the heroes as having the fear modifier, unless the target monster has a shot with the fear modifier in its sequence."

main window. each player takes one power sheet, by consensus or randomly. unused sheets are returned to the box. arrange the seating order so players will take their turns in clockwise order as follows: khorne, nurgle, tzeentch and slaanesh. players take their power markers, victory point (vp) markers, corruption tokens, chaos cards, upgrade cards, and plastic followers. unused components are returned to the box. each player tucks his yet-unused upgrade cards partway under the edge of his power sheet in a stack. each player places his power marker on the highlighted starting space of the power point track on his power sheet, and his vp marker on the 0 space of the board’s vp track. separate the dial advancement counters and old world tokens into piles by type. sort the ruination cards into an ordered stack with the 1 card on top and the 5 card on the bottom, and place it on the board. shuffle the old world cards and deal cards facedown to form the old world deck: 7 cards for a 4-player game, or 8 cards for a 3-player game. place this deck facedown on the board. remaining cards are returned to the box. take 2 noble tokens, 3 warpstone tokens, and 4 peasant tokens and mix these tokens together. randomly choose tokens from this pool one at a time, placing each on the board, one per map region, in the standard region order. each player shuffles his chaos card deck, draws a hand of 3 cards, and places the rest of the deck near his power sheet. the game round each game round is made up of 6 phases in this order: 1. old world phase 2. draw phase 3. summoning phase 4. battle phase 5. corruption phase6. end phase power order when the actions of one power depend on the actions of another, the players always act in power order: khorne first, then nurgle, tzeentch, and slaanesh. region order activity that must be carried out in multiple regions at the same time are carried out region by region, in the region order: norsca, troll country, kislev, the empire, bretonnia, estalia, tilea, the border princes and the badlands. activities carried out in region order are not considered to be simultaneous. 1. the old world phase one card is drawn from the old world deck and its italicized instructions carried out by the player with the lowest threat (who also makes any decisions if required). unless instructed otherwise, the card is then placed faceup in the left-hand (1) space of the old world card track. any card previously there is moved to the 2 space, pushing any card previously in the 2 space out of play and back to the box. old world cards with the text discard this card instead of adding it to the old world track are returned to the game box after their instructions have been carried out, and the cards on the old world track are not affected. 2. the draw phase each player draws cards from his own chaos card deck according to the draw phase instructions on his power sheet. there is no chaos card hand size limit. if a deck is ever exhausted, shuffle the discards to create a fresh deck. each player also moves his power marker to the highlighted space on his power sheet’s power point (pp) track. if a player has purchased one or more upgrade cards that give him extra power points, he may move his marker further than the highlighted value, depending on the upgrade(s). unused pps are never carried over from previous rounds. all players may act simultaneously during this phase. 3. summoning phase the players take successive turns in power order. so after the slaanesh player acts, the khorne player acts again, with this circular order continuing until the phase ends. when your turn to act comes, you may place one follower figure on the board, or play one chaos card. if this requires the expenditure of pps, move your power marker to record your reduced total. when a figure/card with a power cost of 0 is summoned/played, the marker is not adjusted.if you do not wish to summon a figure or play a card on your turn, move your power marker to the 0 space of your power point track, and your turn ends. so long as you have pps left, you may continue to summon a follower or play a card each time your turn comes. if your power marker is on at 0 , your turn is skipped. the phase ends when all players’ markers are at 0. summoning follower figures choose one of your available figures, pay its cost by adjusting your pp track, and place it on a board region. you may select a figure that is, or is not, currently on the board, but in any case the figure is considered summoned. if you do not have enough pp remaining to pay a figure’s cost, you may not choose that figure. a figure must be placed in a region where you already have a figure, or in a region adjacent to such a region. if you have no figures on the board, you may place your first figure in any region. you may count a region as occupied by your own figure if you chose the last figure in that region to summon. playing chaos cards choose a card from your hand of chaos cards, pay its cost by adjusting your power point track, place it on an empty card space on a board region and carry out its effects. if you do not have enough power remaining to pay a card’s cost, you may not choose that card. if a region’s spaces are already full, a card may not be played there. if all 18 spaces are full, you may not play a card. if 2 chaos cards played to the same region would happen simultaneously, the left-hand/western card is resolved first, and the right-hand card resolved second. chaos card effects are mandatory, if they are possible, unless their text notes otherwise. the effects of 2 chaos cards with the same name in the same region are generally cumulative; however some effects are obviously non-cumulative by their nature. 4. the battle phase battle is carried out region by region, in the standard region order, in every region where one player is entitled to roll battle dice and has at least one legal target for his hits. to resolve battle in a region, each player, in the normal power order, does the following: 1. calculates the number of battle dice available and rolls them; then rolls additional dice gained from explosions. 2. assigns hits to legal targets. calculate the number of battle dice available by totaling the attack values of all of your figures in that region. tipped figures still on the board contribute their attack values normally. additional battle dice may be added from the effects of chaos cards or other special circumstances. you must roll all of the battle dice you are entitled to roll. for each of your dice that roll 4, 5, or 6 you score one hit. every result of 6 is an explosion: roll one additional battle die immediately (there is no limit to the number of times battle dice can explode if you continue to roll 6s). once all dice have been rolled, for each hit announce which enemy figure or peasant token you are targeting. each hit must be assigned to a target in the region whose battle is being resolved. a player may not allocate hits against his own figures (unless they are controlled by another player). if enough hits are assigned to a figure that they equal or exceed its defense value, it is killed and tipped onto its side. it is not removed from the board until all players have rolled their battle dice for the region. a hit peasant token is not tipped, but immediately placed on the power sheet belonging to the player who killed it. you may not assign fewer hits to a figure than are necessary to kill it (to store them and combine hits with other players). excess rolled hits (those without a legal target) are lost. if you have legal targets for rolled hits you must assign them. once all players have rolled dice and assigned hits, tipped units are removed from the board. move to the next region, until all battle is done for all regions. early hits from dice rolled “before other figures roll their dice” should be removed from the board immediately instead of being tipped. however, early hits are also cumulative with hits rolled by the same player’s figures when regular battle dice are rolled. beginning of battle and end of battle effects effects that instruct players to carry out certain actions at the beginning or end of the battle phase are carried out before any player rolls his normal battle dice in any region, or after all players roll all battle dice in all regions, respectively.5. the corruption phase 1. domination step for each region, in standard region order, calculate each player’s domination value by adding the summoning costs on any chaos cards that player played in that region to the quantity of figures that player controls in that region. domination value = sum of chaos card costs + quantity of figures the highest domination value is compared to the resistance of the region. if it exceeds the resistance, that player immediately scores vps equal to the region’s conquest value. if 2 or more players tie, none of them dominate it or score victory points. 2. corruption step in standard region order, each player places 1 corruption token in each region for each of his cultists there. before moving on to the next region, count the total number of corruption tokens (counting warpstone tokens) in the region. if this is 12 or more, that region is ruined. if a region is ruined, the top ruination card from the ruination card stack is placed there. each player who placed at least one corruption token in that region during this game round immediately scores the number of vps indicated for ruiners on that ruination card. once the points have been scored, move on to the next region to place corruption tokens. if a region would be ruined, but no ruination cards remain, the region is not ruined and no points are scored, either by ruiners or by the players with the most and second-most corruption tokens there. 6. the end phase 1. remove chaos cards from the board each player removes his played chaos cards from the board and places them in his discard pile. 2. resolve hero tokens in each region with a hero token, the player with the greatest threat who also has at least one figure there must choose one of his figures there and remove it. carry out this process once, one at a time, for each hero token present. 3. resolve old world cards on the old world card track, resolve any effects that begin with: when old world cards are resolved… multiple cards with such effects are resolved in the order of their position on the track. 4. score ruined regions for each ruination card placed this round (still faceup on the board), players score points based on the number of their corruption tokens in the ruined region. ruined regions are scored in standard region order. for each ruined region to be scored, the player with the most corruption tokens in that region scores its first value (as recorded in the ruination card table). then, the player with the second most corruption tokens in that region scores the second value for the region.if only one player has corruption tokens there, only the first value is scored. if 2 or more players tie, the first and second values are summed and divided by the number of tied players to give the vps (rounded down) each of those players scores. fractional vps are not scored. non-tied players do not score. if there is no tie for the most tokens in the region, and 2 or more players tie for the secondmost tokens, the second value is divided by the number of tied players to determine how many vps (rounded down) each of those players scores. the ruination card is then turned facedown in that region, marking it as permanently ruined, and all corruption tokens are cleared from the region. 5. advance threat dials every player who has advancement counters on his dial advances his dial by one clockwise tick and carries out the instruction revealed. additionally, the player with the most counters on his dial advances his dial by one additional tick, carrying out the instruction revealed. if 2 or more players are tied for the most counters, no player scores an additional tick. then all dial advancement counters are returned to the pool. 6. check for game end if any of the following conditions are true, the game ends: 1. one or more players’ threat dials have reached their victory dial instruction. 2. one or more players have scored 50 or more vps. 3. five regions have been ruined. 4. the old world card deck is empty. the 4 conditions are checked in order, and the game ends immediately when one of them is true. further game- ending conditions are not checked once the game has ended, and players may not win by fulfilling them. if more than one player reaches the victory level on his dial, the tied player with more vps wins. if some players remain tied, the victory is shared among them. if more than one player has earned 50 or more vps, the player with the most vps wins. if some players are tied, the tied player with the highest threat wins. if some players are tied for vps when 5 regions have been ruined, the tied player with the highest threat wins. if the old world card deck is empty, all players lose. the threat dials for each text instruction that appears in the main window of a threat dial, a smaller window reveals a corresponding number: that chaos power’s threat. each chaos power has a unique dial advancement condition on its power sheet. each time you fulfill that condition, immediately place one dial advancement counter on your threat dial. a single event cannot trigger the placement of multiple dial advancement tokens.players must carry out an instruction when it is revealed. draw x chaos cards: draws the listed number of chaos cards from your deck and adds them to your hand. place x nobles: take the listed number of noble tokens from the pile and place them in any region(s) of the board. place x warpstone: take the listed number of warpstone tokens from the pile and place them in any region(s) of the board. [power] start: the place where that power’s main window begins the game. [power] victory!: the power named wins the game, subject to ties and other end phase instructions. remove x corruption: remove the listed number of corruption tokens, belonging to any power or combination of powers, from the board. remove x old world tokens: remove the listed number of old world tokens, of any type(s), from the board, returning them to the pile. score x vp: score the listed number of vps. upgrade card: choose one of your upgrade cards that you have not yet placed into play and place it into play. old world cards immediate instructions (italic text) are carried out right away when that card is drawn. persistent effects (non italicized text) are only carried out when the card is on the old world track, and only at certain points in each round. if a particular card does not specify when its persistent effect is carried out, it is carried out in the old world cards step of the end phase. old world tokens event tokens: event tokens mark the regions affected by the persistent effects of some old world cards. if event tokens remain in play after all cards that define their effects have been removed from the old world card track, the tokens remain, but have no effect until a new old world card redefines them. hero tokens: hero tokens eliminate figures from play in a region. noble tokens: each noble token increases a region’s conquest value by one. (this does not affect that region’s resistance.) peasant tokens: peasant tokens are available targets for battle in the regions they occupy. certain old world cards, when drawn, award vps to players who have claimed peasant tokens in battle. skaven tokens: each skaven token decreases a region’s resistance by one. (this does not affect that region’s conquest value.) warpstone tokens: each warpstone token counts as the equivalent of one corruption token when determining whether a region is ruined in the corruption phase.other rules ruined regions when a region is ruined, it is affected by the following rules: a. new chaos cards cannot be played to that region. b. new old world tokens cannot be placed in that region (existing old world tokens are not necessarily removed). c. during the corruption phase, no vps are scored for dominating that region (i.e., domination is not checked). d. during the corruption phase, no corruption tokens are placed in that region. all other normal rules remain in effect for ruined regions. battle still occurs in a ruined region each round, such a region is still adjacent to other regions, it still occupies the same slot in the standard region order, and so on. control of enemy figures when one player uses an effect that gives him control of an enemy figure, then for the duration of the effect, it is as if the figure was of the controlling player’s color. the controlling player thus rolls battle dice for that figure, places a corruption token of his own color during the corruption phase, and so forth. during the duration of the control effect, the figure retains its normal statistics. playing upgrade cards there are 2 types of upgrade cards: follower upgrades and chaos power upgrades. upgrade cards enter play when a player reveals the upgrade card instruction on his threat dial. each time that instruction is revealed, that player may choose one available upgrade card (i.e., not yet in play) and place it into play. when you play a follower upgrade card, announce the upgrade and place the card over the corresponding pre- printed follower statistics on your power sheet. the card’s statistics and abilities replace those the card covers up. when you play a chaos power upgrade card, announce the upgrade and place the card faceup adjacent to your power sheet. the twin-tailed comet icon when old world cards on the old world card track bearing the twin-tailed comet icon must be removed from play, they are returned to the box and no longer affect the game. magic symbols magic symbols have no effect of their own, but their presence in a region is used to resolve other effects. certain effects can impart magic symbols to figures. contradictory effects when effects or abilities come into apparent conflict, the disabling effect trumps the enabling effect."

shuffle the district cards and deal 4 cards facedown to each player. place the district deck facedown in the center of the table and place all gold coins in the center of the table to create the bank. each player takes 2 gold from the bank. the oldest player takes the crown. a player’s gold and the number of cards in their hand are open information. there is an unlimited amount of gold. if the bank runs out, use a substitute, such as a coin. there is no limit to a player’s hand size. 4-8 players the game is played over a series of rounds. the player with the crown is known as the crowned player, who makes sure that each step is followed in order and calls for each character to take their turn during the turn phase. selection phase the crowned player gathers the deck of character cards and shuffles them. first, randomly discard a number of character cards faceup in the center of the table, and then randomly discard 1 facedown. the number of discarded faceup cards depends on the number of players in the game. discarded cards are not used this round. selection phase with 8 characters players faceup cards facedown cards 4 2 1 5 1 1 6 0 1 7 0 1* * 7 players special rule: after the 6th player passes the last character card to the 7th player, the 7th player also takes the character card that was discarded facedown at the start of the round. they choose 1 of these 2 characters and discard the other facedown. the rank 4 character (king, emperor, or patrician) cannot be among the faceup discarded cards. if it is discarded faceup, discard another character card faceup to replace it and shuffle it into the character deck.next, the crowned player takes the remaining character cards, looks at them, and secretly chooses one to keep. then they pass the remaining cards to the player on their left, who also chooses a card and passes the rest of the cards to their left, and so on. this continues until each player has chosen 1 character card. after the last player has chosen their card, they discard the 1 unchosen card facedown near the other discarded cards. turn phase players take turns in ascending order of their chosen character’s rank, which appears in the top-left corner of each character card. the crowned player calls each character number in ascending order, starting with the number 1 (the assassin, witch, or magistrate). if a player has the called character card, they reveal it by flipping it faceup and take their turn. during a turn, the player must gather resources. they can either: • take 2 gold from the bank, or • draw 2 district cards from the deck, choose 1 to keep, and discard the other facedown to the bottom of the deck. after gathering resources, they may build 1 district in their city. to do this, they play a card from their hand faceup in front of them and pay gold to the bank equal to the district’s building cost. a player has a building limit of 1 district per turn, and a player cannot build a district that is identical (with the same name) to a district already in their city. after the player who revealed the called character has taken their turn, or if no player revealed the called character, the crowned player continues calling the next character in ascending order, and so on until they have called all characters, after which a new round begins with the selection phase. character abilities a player may use their character’s abilities only once per turn at the time specified. character abilities are optional (unless the word must or cannot is used). if no specific time for an ability’s use is given, the player can use the ability at any time during their turn. this includes abilities that gain resources for districts in your city. some characters have abilities that gain gold or cards for districts of a certain type in their city. as a reminder, their rank number appears on a gem of the color of the corresponding district type.districts there are 5 district types: noble , religious , trade , military , and unique . each unique district has an effect described on its card. district effects are optional unless the word must or cannot is used. effects that are limited to once per turn can be used only during your turn. game end a completed city has at least 7 districts (4-8 players) or at least 8 districts (2-3 players). as soon as a city is completed, the game ends after the current round is finished. score points: • score points equal to the building cost of each of your districts. • if your city has at least 1 district of each type, score 3 points. • the player who first completed their city scores 4 points. • any other player who completed their city scores 2 points. • score any extra points from your unique districts. the player with the most points wins. on a tie, the tied player who revealed the character with the highest-numbered rank during the last round wins. 2-3 player changes in 2 or 3 player games, each player plays with 2 characters. play normally, except that each player takes 2 turns each round (1 turn for each character). each player has only 1 stash of gold and 1 city, and each character’s abilities apply only during its own turn. 2 player rule changes setup the character deck includes characters of rank 1-8 (the emperor cannot be used in 2 player games). selection phase the crowned player gathers the deck of character cards and shuffles them, then randomly discards 1 card facedown in the center of the table. then they take the remaining 7 cards, secretly choose 1 to keep, and pass the remaining 6 cards to their opponent. for the remaining selections this round, each player chooses 2 character cards: 1 they keep, the other they discard facedown near the other discarded cards, and then they pass the remaining cards to their opponent. this continues until there are no more characters remaining. game end as soon as a city has 8 districts, it is complete and the game ends after the current round is finished.3 player rule changes

of the table. then they take the remaining 8 cards, secretly choose 1 to keep, and pass the remaining 7 cards to the player on their left, who chooses a card and passes the remaining 6 cards to the player on their left, who also chooses a card. now, after each player has chosen 1 card, the third player randomly discards 1 of the remaining 5 cards facedown near the other discarded card. then they pass the 4 remaining cards to the crowned player. each player in turn chooses a second character card, and the last unchosen card is discarded facedown near the other discarded cards. game end as soon as a city has 8 districts, it is complete and the game ends after the current round is finished. customization you can add more variety by playing with different characters and unique districts. use the preset options or choose what to use in the game as follows: before the game begins, choose a cast of 8 characters, 1 for each rank from 1 to 8. these will be the characters used this game; return all other character cards to the box. also before the game begins, choose 14 unique districts of varying building costs to use this game. prepare the district deck by shuffling the chosen unique districts with the 54 basic districts. then return the unused unique districts to the game box. using 9 characters using the rank 9 character is required in games with 3 or 8 players, and is optional

turn, they must remain silent and skip their entire turn for this round without revealing their character card. witch first you must gather resources, then you must call the name of another character whom you wish to bewitch, and then your turn is put on hold. you cannot build at this time, and the only district effects you can use are those that occur when gathering resources (gold mine, library, or observatory). when the bewitched character is called to take their turn, they gather resources and their turn immediately ends. they cannot build a district or use any of their character’s abilities—not even those that provide ‘extra’ resources (like the merchant’s extra gold). the only district effects that the bewitched player can use are those that occur when gathering resources. now you resume your turn as if you were playing the bewitched character; you use that character’s abilities, including those that provide extra resources, passive abilities, and restrictions. you play with the cards in your hand, pay with the gold in your stash, gain resources from districts in your city, and build new districts in your city. you cannot use effects from unique districts owned by the bewitched player. if the blackmailer is bewitched, you assign threat markers, receive bribes from threatened players, and choose to reveal the threat marker if the targeted player does not pay. if the king or patrician is bewitched, they still take the crown. if the emperor is bewitched, you choose whom to give the crown to and take the resource from that player. if the bewitched character is not in play this round, you do not resume your turn. magistrate take the 3 warrant markers and assign them facedown to 3 different character tokens of your choice. one of the markers shows the signed warrant on its face; only the player marked with the signed warrant is targeted.if the targeted player pays to build a district during their turn, you may reveal their warrant marker by flipping it faceup. if you do, you confiscate that district and build it in your city instead for free. the confiscated district never enters the targeted player’s city, but it does count toward the targeted player’s building limit for the turn. the targeted player receives back all gold paid for that district. if they are able to build more than 1 district during their turn, you can confiscate only the first district they pay to build. you cannot confiscate a district if you have an identical district (with the same name) already in your city. thief call the name of another character whom you wish to rob. when a player reveals that character to take their turn, you immediately take all of their gold. you cannot rob the rank 1 character (assassin, witch, or magistrate), the killed character, or the bewitched character. spy choose another player and name a district type ( noble , religious , trade , military , or unique ). then look at the cards in that player’s hand. for each card in their hand that matches the named district type, take 1 gold from that player’s stash and gain 1 card from the deck. if the player whose hand you looked at has more cards of matching districts than gold in their stash, you take all the gold in their stash, and you still gain cards for each of the matching districts. blackmailer take the 2 threat markers and assign them facedown to two different character tokens of your choice. one of the markers shows the flowered lace on its face; both players are threatened, but only the player marked with the flowered lace is targeted. when a threatened player is called to take their turn, they must immediately gather resources and then resolve the threat: they can bribe you by giving you half their gold (rounded down), which removes their threat marker without revealing it. a threatened player with only 1 gold in their stash can bribe you by giving you 0 gold. if they do not bribe you, you may reveal their threat marker by flipping it faceup. if you reveal the flowered lace, you immediately take all their gold. a threatened player must resolve the threat before they are able to use any of their character abilities or build districts, and the only district effects they can use before resolving the threat are those that occur when gathering resources (gold mine, library, or observatory). you cannot assign threat markers to the rank 1 character (assassin, witch, or magistrate), the killed character, or the bewitched character. you can assign threat markers to characters who have been assigned warrant markers. magician you can do 1 of the following: exchange your entire hand of cards with another player’s hand of cards; if you have 0 cards in your hand, you simply take the other player’s cards. discard any number of cards from your hand facedown to the bottom of the district deck to gain an equal number of cards from the deck. wizard look at another player’s hand of cards and choose 1 of those cards. then either pay to immediately build the chosen card in your city or add it to your hand. if you immediately build it, it does not count toward your building limit, which means you can build another district this turn. during this turn, you can build districts that are identical to any other district already in your city. seer take a card at random from each other player’s hand and add those cards to your hand. then give 1 card from your hand to each player you took a card from. if a player has no cards in hand, you neither take a card from them nor give them a card. taken cards can be kept and given back in several different combinations: you can give a player the exact same card back, you can give a card taken from one player to another, or you can keep a card taken and give back a card from your original hand. your building limit this turn is 2. king you gain 1 gold for each noble district in your city. at some point during your turn, you must take the crown. you are now the crowned player, so you call characters for the rest of the round, and you will be the first to choose a character during the next round (until another player chooses the king). if you are killed, you skip your turn like any other character. at the end of the round, reveal the king’s character card and take the crown as the king’s heir. if you are bewitched, you still take the crown.if the king is discarded faceup at the start of the selection phase, randomly discard another character card faceup to replace it and shuffle the king into the character deck. emperor you gain 1 gold for each noble district in your city. at some point during your turn, you must take the crown from the player who has it and give it to a different player, but not yourself. you take either 1 gold from their stash or 1 card at random from their hand. if they have neither gold in their stash nor cards in hand, you do not take anything. if you are killed, you skip your turn like any other character. at the end of the round, reveal the emperor’s character card and, as the emperor’s advisor, take the crown from the player who has it and give it to a different player, but not yourself. you do not take a resource from the new crowned player. if the emperor is discarded faceup at the start of the selection phase, randomly discard another character card faceup to replace it and shuffle the emperor into the character deck. the emperor cannot be used in a 2 player game. patrician you gain 1 card for each noble district in your city. at some point during your turn, you must take the crown. you are now the crowned player, so you call characters for the rest of the round, and you will be the first to choose a character during the next round (until another player chooses the patrician). if you are killed, you skip your turn like any other character. at the end of the round, reveal the patrician’s character card and take the crown as the patrician’s heir. if you are bewitched, you still take the crown. if the patrician is discarded faceup at the start of the selection phase, randomly discard another character card faceup to replace it and shuffle the patrician into the character deck. bishop you gain 1 gold for each religious district in your city. during this round, the rank 8 character (warlord, diplomat, or marshal) cannot use its ability on your districts. if you are killed, the rank 8 character can use its ability on your districts. similarly, if you are bewitched, the rank 8 character cannot use its ability on the witch’s districts, but it can use its ability on the bishop’s districts.abbot you gain either 1 gold or 1 card for each religious district in your city. you can choose any combination of the 2 resources. you must declare the combination of resources you wish to take before taking them. if at any point during your turn you are not the player with the most gold, the richest player must give you 1 gold from their stash. if there is a tie for the richest player, choose which of the tied players must give you 1 of their gold. if you are among those tied for the richest player, you do not receive any gold. cardinal you gain 1 card for each religious district in your city. if you want to build a district, but you do not have enough gold to do so, you can take the remaining gold needed from one player. for each gold you take, you must give that player 1 card from your hand. then you must pay to build that district in your city. a player cannot deny you their gold, and you cannot take more gold than is needed to build the intended district. merchant you gain 1 gold for each trade district in your city. you gain 1 extra gold. you can use this ability regardless of which resource you gathered this turn. alchemist at the end of your turn, you receive back all the gold you paid to build districts this turn, but not gold you paid for other reasons (such as the smithy’s effect or the tax collector’s tax). this effectively means that you can build districts ‘for free’, but only if you would have had enough gold to build them. trader you gain 1 gold for each trade district in your city. trade districts do not count toward your building limit this turn. this effectively means that you can build any number of trade districts in addition to your building limit. architect gain 2 extra cards. you can use this ability regardless of which resource you gathered this turn. your building limit this turn is 3.navigator you gain either 4 gold or 4 cards.you can use this ability regardless of which resource you gathered this turn. you cannot build any

district deck and place it facedown in the center of the table. your building limit this turn is 2. warlord you gain 1 gold for each military district in your city. you can destroy 1 district of your choice by paying 1 fewer gold than its building cost. you cannot destroy a district in a completed city, but you can destroy one of your own districts. destroyed districts are discarded facedown to the bottom of the district deck. diplomat you gain 1 gold for each military district in your city. you can exchange 1 district in another player’s city for 1 district in your city. if the other player’s district has a higher cost than your district, you must give that player the difference in gold from your stash. if your district has a higher cost than the other player’s district, that player does not owe you any gold in return. you cannot exchange for a district in a completed city nor for a district identical to a district already in your city, but you can exchange one of your districts if you have a completed city. the district coming from your city cannot be identical to a district already in the other player’s city. marshal you gain 1 gold for each military district in your city. you can seize 1 district with a building cost of 3 or less in another player’s city by giving the owner gold equal to its building cost. the seized district is added to your city. you cannot seize a district in a completed city nor a district identical to a district already in your city.queen if you are sitting next to the player who revealed the rank 4 character (king, emperor, or patrician), gain 3 gold. if this character is sitting next to you, but has been killed by the assassin, you gain 3 gold when that card is revealed at the end of the round. the queen cannot be used in games with fewer than 5 players. artist you can beautify up to 2 of your districts by assigning them each 1 gold from your stash. the cost of a beautified district is permanently increased by 1, so a beautified district scores 1 more point at the end of the game, the warlord must pay 1 more gold to destroy a beautified district, etc. (keep the gold on the card as a reminder). a district can be beautified only once. tax collector when the tax collector is a character in the game, players are charged a property tax for building districts. immediately after a player builds a district, they place 1 gold from their stash on the tax collector’s character token. this applies even when a player builds a district they have not paid to build. if a player builds more than 1 district, they are charged the property tax for each district built. if a player has no gold remaining in his stash after building a district, they are not charged a tax. the tax collector is not charged a tax. at any time during your turn, you can take all gold from the tax collector’s token into your stash. even if the tax collector does not appear during a round, players are always taxed, and any gold left on the tax collector’s token carries over to the next round. in 2 and 3 player games, a player who chooses the tax collector as one of their characters is still charged a tax for their other character. if the magistrate confiscates a district from a player, the magistrate is charged the tax, not their target. district clarifications armory a district in a completed city cannot be destroyed. capitol the capitol can score extra points only once. framework the magistrate cannot confiscate a district built by destroying the framework, but the magistrate can confiscate the next district the targeted player pays to build.great wall the diplomat does not apply the great wall’s effect to the district they are exchanging from their city. haunted quarter at the end of the game, if the haunted quarter’s owner chooses to count its district type as anything other than unique , it no longer counts as unique . ivory tower if the ivory tower and haunted quarter are the only unique districts in a city and the owner chooses to count the haunted quarter as a district type other than unique , the owner scores extra points for the ivory tower. museum if the museum is exchanged or seized, assigned cards stay with the museum. if the museum is destroyed, discard assigned cards facedown to the bottom of the deck. necropolis the magistrate cannot confiscate the necropolis if it is built without paying its cost, but the magistrate can confiscate the next district the targeted player pays to build. park if the owner is the witch and does not resume their turn, the park cannot resolve. poor house if the owner is the witch and does not resume their turn, the poor house cannot resolve. if the owner is the alchemist with 0 gold at the end of their turn, they apply the poor house’s effect first before applying the alchemist’s ability. quarry the owner can build any number of identical districts in their city, but they cannot use the magistrate, diplomat, or marshal to acquire identical districts. school of magic the abbot gains 1 of either resource. stables if confiscated by the magistrate, the player can still build another district this turn. theater the owner blindly chooses who to exchange cards with, without being able to look at anyone’s character card. exchanged cards are not revealed until called during the turn phase, but the players involved in the exchange can look at their new character. in 2 and 3 player games, the owner chooses which of their 2 characters to give away and randomly chooses which of their opponent’s characters to take in return. thieves’ den if confiscated by the magistrate, the owner receives back only gold spent, not cards."

the unused colors on the zombie leader wheel on the crossroads board. the player to the right of the first player draws as many movement cards as the number of characters he is playing. then, that player places one of their characters on each of the locations shown. if a movement card indicates a location where all the character spaces are occupied, then the character is placed on the crossroads. all players place their characters this way, in counter clockwise order (so the first player will place his characters last). deal each player a hand of action cards or, if all players

following order, from top to bottom: 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, and 4:00 in the morning. if the game is played using side a of the water tower, players with a character on the tower get to look at the 1:00 invasion card. if playing with side b of the water tower, then players with a character on the tower play their movement cards after the other players. draft distribution of action cards 1. deal the cards according to the number of players. 2. each player secretly chooses 1 card from among those they’ve received and places it in front of them facedown. remaining cards are handed to the player on their left. 3. each player secretly chooses 1 card from those received from the player to their right and hands the remaining cards to the player to their left. 4. proceed this way until each player has the proper number of cards facedown in front of them.game round 1. movement card selection each player secretly chooses 1 of their movement cards. when all have chosen, each player reveals their card simultaneously. when playing with version b of the water tower, the player(s) with characters on the water tower can play their movement cards after everyone else has revealed theirs. 2. invasion reveal the invasion card and apply its effects. first move the zombies indicated from one location to another (these start at 2:00 am). there can never be more than 8 zombies on a location. if any effect would result in more zombies on a location, additional zombies are not added or moved there. then place zombies, airdropped action cards and antidote tokens on the indicated areas, and move the zombie leader if appropriate. the water tower and the crossroads never get airdropped supplies. 3. character movement each player, starting with the first player and going clockwise, must choose 1 of their character tokens and move it to the location shown on their chosen movement card. each location has a limited number of character spaces. when you place a character on a location, place it on one of the available spaces. the chosen character cannot already be on the chosen destination. if all of a location’s character spaces are occupied, place the character on the crossroads. a character can attempt to move from the crossroads to a full location and thus be forced to move back to the crossroads. 4. location resolution in order, starting from location 1, perform the following 3 steps at each of the 6 locations. once a location is resolved do not return to it for the rest of the turn (even if zombies are added to it). a. activation in turn order, the players who have at least 1

the conditions at a location for a zombie attack are met, an attack must occur. players at the location vote to choose the character who dies. players get 1 vote per character they control at the location. on a tie, the player with the first player token splits ties. players may not play action cards or use character powers to change the result of the vote. these can only be played before the vote. when a character dies, the player who controls it returns its token and card to the box. zombies remain where they are. c. sharing if there are action cards and/or antidotes on a location, a vote occurs to see who decides how to share the items among the players present.all players (not only the players at the location) can discuss, negotiate and try and influence the votes. when no one wants to act anymore, the vote takes place. each player has 1 vote per character they control present at the location. the winner of the vote may look at any action cards, and must then distribute all the items (cards and antidotes) as he sees fit (even to players not at the location). each player may only get 1 item each time sharing occurs. if there are more elements to share than there are players, the extra item(s) remain on the location to be shared in a future turn. end of the game after the last turn of the game, the rescue helicopter arrives. each player must discard 1 antidote for each of his characters still alive. each character without an antidote immediately dies. then, each player’s score is calculated: • each character still alive is worth as many points as its current value. • each remaining antidote token is worth 1 point. • each food token is worth as many points as indicated on the token. a player with no living characters scores no points. the player with the most points wins the game. on a tie, the player with the most characters still alive wins. on a further tie, all tied players win. character death and the first player token when a player loses a character, they take the first player token. in case of a tie due to the explosion of the water tower, give the marker to the first player who was a victim in the turn order. a player that loses their last character is eliminated from the game and can no longer play action cards. the first player token goes to the next player in clockwise order. action cards action cards can be played at any time except right after a vote. the card is then placed in the discard pile. all players can check the discard pile at any time. an action card can be played anywhere, even at a location where a player doesn’t have a character present. if an action card with the explosion symbol is played for its effect, an explosion marker must be added to either the water tower or the armory. if a card with this symbol is just discarded to trigger another effect, no marker is added. character powers powers can be played at any point except right after a vote. a character card must have its rested (blue) side faceup to use its power. once used, the character card is flipped over to its exhausted (red) side. exhausted characters are worth fewer victory points. the church and the energy drink card allow players to flip an exhausted character back to its rested side. note however the pregnant woman may never be flipped back to her rested side once flipped. voting voting to see who dies during a zombie attack, or to see who shares out any airdropped items, proceeds as follows: players who have characters at the location where the vote takes place have 1 vote for each character present.before the vote, all players can play action cards and/or activate the powers of a character. once the vote is done, it is no longer possible to play cards or powers to change its outcome. all players who have a vote raise their hand. players count 1... 2... 3 out loud and on 3 must point at the player they choose. you may not split multiple votes among different players. the player chosen must have at least 1 character in the location where the vote is taking place. you may choose yourself. the player who has the most votes in their favor wins the vote (either one of their characters present dies or they decide how to share the items). negotiations and trades during the game, players can freely trade action cards, antidotes and information between themselves. promises made regarding the location currently being resolved must be respected, but promises on future locations are not binding. however, players may decide before the game to allow promises to be broken at any time. the water tower and the armory as soon as the 3rd explosion marker is placed on the water tower and the current action ends, the tower is removed and the water tower tile is flipped to its exploded side. all characters and zombies present die. return the explosion markers to tthe game box. the water tower can only explode once per game. any subsequent explosion markers must be placed on the armory. the effects of the explosion markers on the armory vary depending on whether side a or b is being used. once the armory is full of explosion markers, any subsequent explosion markers must be placed on the water tower. the crossroads at the crossroads, there’s no vote to choose the victim of a zombie attack. the color of the victim is indicated by the position of the zombie leader token. if there are no characters of that color at that location, the zombie leader token is moved clockwise 1 space at a time until it reaches the color of a player with a character present. the zombie leader skips the grey caches and only stops on the colored spaces. once a character has been eaten, the attack is finished. the token is then moved 1 space clockwise. if there’s at least 1 zombie present, but all characters there are hidden, the zombie leader token doesn’t move and no one is eaten. clarifications hidden characters all character present at a location (even hidden ones) count in the total number of characters at a location when evaluating the conditions of a zombie attack. a hidden character can’t vote, but can receive an item. cancellation effects cancellation effects must be played at the moment when the other card is played. before the destination of the little cat is drawn, before the explosion marker is placed, etc. wait a moment before applying the effects of cards which are susceptible to cancellation. all cards can be cancelled, even canned food at the end of the game. food tokens when a food token is discarded to use at a location, the token is removed from the game."
57,133528,CITY OF REMNANTS,2013,PLAID HAT GAMES,3.1467,75,"setup use the side with some blocked-off squares for a 3 player game, and the other side for a 2 or 4 player game. outer spaces on the board (red) are slums, the middle ring (blue) are midtown, and the inner spaces (green) are heights. separate the 4 sets of 10 starter cards. each player chooses (or is randomly assigned) a gang leader and his matching deck, player mat, and figures. return unused starter cards to the box. shuffle your starter cards to form your draw pile, and draw 4 cards as your starting hand. place a turn tracker token on the 0 space of your turn track and an influence tracker token on the 4 space of your influence track. place 7 of your figures on the gang member pool. each player chooses a different side of the board. the space in the centre of your side with the crosshairs is your gang’s entry space. shuffle the remaining unit cards to create a facedown gang member deck and turn the first 4 cards faceup in a row next to the board. shuffle the black market cards to create a facedown black market deck and turn the first 4 cards faceup in a row next to the board. separate the 18 development draft cards into their 3 different types (red slums, blue midtowns, and green heights). randomly select 3 cards of each type and lay out all copies of the matching development tiles, along with the cards, next to the board. all other developments are returned to the box. create a pool of arc tokens. each player takes 2,000 arcs. create a pool of product tokens and a pool of renown tokens with a total value of 200. shuffle the ycu coordinate cards to create a facedown ycu coordinate deck. place the ycu alert reference card next to the deck. put all the ycu tokens in the cloth bag and shuffle them. all players roll the 6-sided die; the highest roller receives the first player token (on a tie, all players with the highest roll reroll). the game is divided into rounds, each of which is divided into 4 phases that must be played in order. reset phase skip the reset phase on the first turn of the game. all players may discard any number of cards from their hand into their discard pile. then shuffle your discard pile and place it facedown under your draw pile. finally, draw enough cards from your draw pile so you have a number of cards in your hand equal to your influence. the player with the first player token passes it to the player on his left. each player receives 2,000 arcs. discard all remaining faceup black market cards and draw 4 more faceup. discard all remaining faceup gang member cards and draw 4 more faceup. player turns phase starting with the first player and going clockwise, each player takes a turn, until each player has taken 4 turns. if it is your turn and your turn track is already on turn 4 (because you recruited gang members outside of your turn) skip your turn.during your turn, select one action to perform from among the actions on your player mat. you can also play one or more cards from your hand at any time during your turn. after playing a card, discard it. cards with the word battle in their special ability only trigger when played into a battle; those without the word battle do not trigger when revealed in battle. after you have finished taking your turn, advance your turn tracker token one space on your turn track. once all players’ turn trackers are on the 4 space of this track, the player turns phase is over. yugai patrol phase return any ycu (yugai control unit) tokens on the board to the bag and shuffle them. the first player draws and reveals 2 ycu coordinate cards, then randomly draws ycu tokens from the bag, one at a time, placing one on each of the coordinates listed on the cards. after all the tokens are placed, if one or more of the tokens was placed on a space occupied by a player’s figures, that player must immediately battle them. you may battle ycu in any order. if more than one player has to battle ycu, the player currently highest on the turn order (starting with the first player and going clockwise) conducts all of his ycu battles first before moving to the next player. all ycu battles are resolved in this phase. any ycu that aren’t defeated during this phase remain on the board until they are defeated, or until the beginning of the next yugai patrol phase. award renown phase players collect renown tokens for the board spaces and the developments they control that offer renown awards. you may conceal the values of your renown tokens. if you should gain renown and there are not enough renown tokens left to claim, count up the renown you would have received and add it to your current total to find your total renown score for the game. the game is over at the end of a round in which there are not enough tokens for players to claim in the renown phase. actions recruit select one of the 4 faceup gang member cards and declare your intent to recruit that gang member. starting with the player to your left and going clockwise, each other player who still has at least one turn left in this round may bid on that gang member. if no player bids, you recruit the gang member for free. the first player clockwise may bid on the gang member by announcing the number of arcs he is willing to pay for him. subsequent players may choose to raise the bid by any amount or pass. if you pass, you drop out of the bidding. continue going around the table until all but one of the players have passed. the remaining player pays his bid and recruits the gang member. if you recruit a gang member outside of your turn, advance your turn tracker one space on your turn track. if the player who declared his intent to recruit is outbid, it is still that player’s turn; he selects a different gang member to attempt to recruit, and continues to do this until he has successfully recruited a gang member. if there are no faceup gang member cards when you announce a recruit action, you must reveal the top card of the gang member deck and attempt to recruit that card. when you recruit a gang member, add its unit card to your hand and place one figure in your gang member pool.buy buy one black market card from among the 4 faceup cards next to the black market deck. pay that card’s arc cost and adds it to your hand. if there no faceup black market cards, you cannot buy a black market card. in addition, during a buy action, you may buy renown tokens for 3,000 arcs each. you may buy a number of renown up to your influence value during each of your buy actions. produce >>> develop you may carry out the effects of each development you control that has a produce >>> develop special ability. you may then build a new development from among those available next to the board by paying its arc cost and placing its tile on the board. you cannot place a development on one or more spaces that already contain a development, and it must be placed on spaces that match that development’s level restriction. you may place a development on a space that contains figures (move them on top of the tile). placing a development tile does not give you control over it; you must have at least one figure on each space of the board that the development tile occupies. sell you may sell (discard) product tokens on developments you control to gain arcs. you may only sell a number of products equal to your influence. the development tiles with products on them detail how many arcs are gained from selling those products. refresh you may refresh your cards in the same way as you do in the reset phase of every round. discard as many cards from your hand as desired into your discard pile, then shuffle your discard pile and place it facedown under your draw pile. finally, draw enough cards from your draw pile so you have a number of cards in your hand equal to your influence. move you may move a number of your figures equal to your influence, each up to 3 spaces. you must complete a figure’s movement before moving the next figure. a figure cannot end its move on a space that already contains 2 figures that you control. a figure cannot move diagonally. you may move a figure from a space on the board to another (legal) space, or from your gang member pool onto your entry space (this counts as having moved one of that figure’s 3 spaces) if you move a figure into a space that contains one or more enemies (ie, figures belonging to other players, or ycu tokens) that figure’s movement stops. you can never move your figures into more than one space containing enemies during a single turn. at the end of a move action, a battle takes place in any space that is contested (ie, has more than one player’s figures on it). battling another player when 2 players battle over a contested space, the attacker is the player whose turn it is. he starts the battle by laying all of the cards he wants to play into that battle facedown in front of him. you may choose to lay down a number of cards up to his current influence from either his hand, the top of his draw pile, or a combination of both (he cannot look at cards he is sending to battle that come off of his draw pile). the other player involved in the battle is the defender. after the attacker has laid down his cards, the defender lays down the cards he wants to send to battle in the same way as the attacker (and also limited by his influence).once both players have laid their cards down for battle, the attacker reveals his cards and triggers any battle special abilities. then the defender reveals his cards and does the same. next, both players roll a number of battle dice equal to the number of figures they have in the contested space and each orthogonally adjacent space. players add the result of their rolls to the total attack value of their cards (dependent on the player’s color) to come up with their total attack value for the battle. whoever has the higher attack value is the winner. if the attack value totals are equal, the defender wins. after a battle, if the space is still contested, another battle takes place there until only one player’s units remain. battling yugai control units add the attack values of all the ycu tokens in a space to find the total ycu attack value of each token in that space. if you must battle more than one ycu, battle them one at a time in an order of your choosing. lay down the cards you want to send into battle (using the same rules as battling another player) and then reveal them. then roll a number of battle dice equal to the number of figures you have in the contested space and each orthogonally adjacent space. add the results of your roll to the attack value on your cards. if the total is equal to or higher than the ycu attack value, you have defeated that ycu; return it to the bag, roll the 6-sided die, and refer to the ycu alert card. if this results in more ycu units being placed, resolve any battles begun by these new units. if your total is lower than that of the ycu token, you are defeated. after a battle, if there are still contested spaces, battles continue until there are no contested spaces left. instead of battling a ycu, you may bribe it by paying a number of arcs equal to its bribe value and placing the token back in the bag. you do not roll a die afterward. defeat if you are defeated in battle with another player or a ygu token, you must remove one of your figures on the contested space and place it back into your pile of unused figures. you must also remove one of the unit cards you played in the battle from the game (return it to the game box). if you played no cards in the battle, you must choose and remove one gang member card from his discard pile. if you have no discard pile, you must choose and remove one gang member card in your hand or you may search your draw pile for a gang member card to remove from the game (if you search your draw pile you must shuffle your draw pile afterwards). a card removed from the game must be revealed to all players. gaining influence as soon as you meet one of the conditions listed on your player mat that allows you to gain influence, announce this and advance your inluence marker one space on its track. you can never lose influence once it is gained, even if you cease to meet the conditions whereby you gained it, and you can never meet the same condition twice. victory during the award renown phase, if there were not enough renown tokens for all players to claim the renown they earned for the round, those players add the renown they would have claimed to their current total of tokens. each black market card you have at the end of the game is 1 worth reknown. the result is their final score. the player with the highest renown total wins the game. if 2 or more players are tied for highest renown total, the tied player with the most arcs wins."
58,69120,CITY OF THIEVES,2010,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,2.3243,111,"setup characters belong to 4 gangs with colored bases: executioners, the nocturnis gang, kaldern’s gang and the cursed ones. the 2 militiamen (black bases) and 2 heroes, isabeau and sienna, (grey bases) do not belong to any gang. choose an adventure board (or pick one randomly) and place it next to the main board. place the round counter on square 1. players each choose a gang; the 4 miniatures of the gang’s color and their corresponding character cards; and 7 action point (ap) tokens. place the 2 militiamen miniatures; one in the guardroom and one in the treasury. mix the chest tokens (treasure side down) and randomly place one in each room on the board. then flip the tokens faceup to reveal the treasures. shuffle the mission cards and place 3 cards faceup on the adventure board. when a mission card is used, it is discarded and a new mission card drawn to replace it; there are always 3 missions available. shuffle the arcana cards and deal 5 cards to each player. the remaining mission and arcana cards form facedown decks. players each roll 2 dice. the highest roller is the first player. starting with the first player, players take turns placing their characters, one at a time, on any deployment space, until all players have placed all 4 of their characters. there can only be one character in each deployment space. the first player now starts the first game round. characters characters have 3 ability values: combat is used when fighting. movement is the number of spaces the character can move each turn. mind is used when trying to pick the lock on a chest, or to succeed at certain special tasks. each character also has one unique skill; using a skill does not count as an action, though some skills require that the player spend an ap token to use them. a character can take an action, move, and use his skill all in the same turn. some skills can be used only when the character is activated; others are in effect all of the time. your ducats are kept hidden from the other players. the game round spent ap tokens are returned to all players. move the round counter 1 square on the adventure board. when it lands on an event square, read out and apply the event. each gang takes 1 turn during each round. the first player takes a turn first, then the other gangs take turns in clockwise order. a gang’s turn is divided into 4 phases, played in order: 1. draw 1 arcana card draw one arcana card and add it to your hand. 2. move a militiaman indicate which militiaman you wish to move and roll a die: if you roll a 6 he does not move. otherwise, the militiaman may move up to the number of spaces rolled.3. activate characters activate your characters one at a time. characters spend aps to move, open chests, attack other characters, and use skills. you may also choose to play arcana cards and/or use a mission card. using a mission card costs 3 aps. arcana cards cannot be played to help a militiaman. 4. announce the end of the turn when you have activated all of the characters you wish, your turn is over and the player to your left can begin. move a militiamen the militiamen move and attack without spending any aps, but otherwise follow the same rules for movement as characters. you do not have to use all of a militiaman’s movement, and they will never leave the district. when a militiaman enters a space occupied by another character there is a fight. the player who moved the militiaman controls him during the fight. if a militiaman wins he takes 2 ducats from the loser (returning them to the bank) and forces him to run away 3 spaces (chosen by the player who won the fight). if the fight ends in a tie the militiaman wins. if a militiaman loses he runs away 3 spaces (chosen by the player who won the fight). after the fight is over, the militiaman is finished moving for the turn; any remaining movement is lost. a player may not use a militiaman to attack a member of his own gang. militiamen never attack each other. activate characters characters must be activated in order to move and take actions. each time a character moves or acts, the player must spend action points (aps). a player normally has 7 ap tokens each turn to spend with his characters. you usually take all the tokens back at the beginning of the next round. activate your characters one at a time in any order you choose, spending any aps you wish to with that character before activating the next. you do not have to use all of your aps, but unused points are lost. a character may only be activated once per turn. when you are finished with one and activate another, you cannot go back to the first character. you do not have to activate all your characters. each character is limited to one movement and one action each turn. these may be taken in either order. characters do not have to move and take an action when they are activated; the character can do one, or the other, or both. each character can also use his skill during his activation. some skills cost aps to use, as described on the character cards. all of a character’s movement must be completed at the same time (though some skills are used during movement). movement to move, a character must spend 1 ap; he may then move a number of spaces up to his movement value. a space must be adjacent and cannot be occupied by any other character. 2 spaces are adjacent if separated by a white line or a green arrow. red lines are solid walls and block movement, as do portcullises. white lines allow movement. green arrows indicate doors or windows which allow characters in and out of a room space. characters cannot move onto the roof of any building. a character may only enter a space occupied by another character when attacking. a character running away after losing a fight may pass through a space occupied by another character, but he must end his move in an unoccupied space. a character may only leave the district if the alarm has been sounded. a character may leave the district from any deployment space that is not blocked by a portcullis, at a cost of 1 movement point. a player can only move his own characters off the board. opening a chest lock-picking a chest costs 1 ap. a character in the same space as a chest may attempt to lock-pick it open: roll 1 die. if he rolls less than or equal to his mind value, the chest is opened. if he fails, the chest remains locked. bashing open a chest costs 2 aps. a character in the same space as a chest may automatically bash it open. a treasure token showing the chest side faceup can only be robbed by bashing open the chest. treasures when a chest is opened, the token is collected and placed faceup on the character’s card (subject

are worth 5, and three are worth 8 ducats. bracelets the total value is determined by the number collected by the gang: one bracelet is worth 2 ducats, two are worth 5, and three are worth 8 ducats. purses when a purse is found, roll one die: the result is the number of ducats you immediately take from the bank. the purse is then removed from the game. chest full of ducats a chest only earns ducats if the character manages to carry it out of the district. once it is safe, roll 1 die and add +3: the result is the number of ducats you take from the bank. carrying limits when a character acquires a treasure, the token is placed on the character card. a character may only carry up to 3 treasures at a time. if he exceeds this limit, he must immediately choose a treasure and drop it in any room of his choice that does not currently house a treasure. this treasure chest can be opened again in the normal way. attacking attacking is an action costing 1 ap. the attacker must move into his victim’s space during his normal movement. this always ends his movement. a thief can never attack a militiaman. a character’s combat value is the number of dice the player rolls when the character is involved in a fight.1. attacker announces his combat value; may play 1 arcana card. 2. defender announces his combat value; may play 1 arcana card. 3. attacker and the defender roll dice. the highest single die a character rolls is his combat score. 4. the character with the highest score wins. if scores are tied, the attacker wins the fight. the winner steals one of his opponent’s treasures (or 2 ducats if the loser has no treasure). if the winner end up with a number of treasures over his carrying limit, he must drop one. the loser runs away 3 spaces. he is moved 3 spaces by the winner of the fight. if it is not possible to move 3 spaces, he must move as far as possible. as he runs away, he may cross a space occupied by another character, but he must end up in an unoccupied space. a fleeing character cannot move onto the same space more than once during this movement. arcana cards each round, each player draws 1 arcana card at the beginning of his turn and adds it to his hand. during his turn, each player may play as many arcana cards as desired. when a card is played, read the text and follow the instructions. when a card contradicts the rules, follow the card. each arcana card can be played only once, and is discarded after use. there is no limit to the number of arcana cards a player can hold in his hand. mission cards missions give players an opportunity to earn bonus ducats. to use a mission card, a gang needs to hold at least one token with the treasure indicated on the card and spend 3 aps during its turn. the characters must still be on the board. a gang may only use 1 mission card per turn. you cannot hold or save the mission card to use later. the ducats immediately received from the bank are equal to the full value of the treasure shown, plus the bonus indicated: +0 bonus: take 0 extra ducats per treasure. +1 bonus: take 1 extra ducat per treasure. +2 bonus: take 2 extra ducats per treasure. add the value of all the matching treasure tokens that your characters still on the board are currently carrying to the mission bonus, then receive the total in ducats from the bank. you keep your treasures after completing the mission. you may be able to earn ducats for these treasures again, either by using another mission card or by removing them from the board. once a mission card is used, it is immediately discarded and replaced by a new one from the deck. add the new mission card to the adventure board. if the deck of mission cards runs out, do not reshuffle them. end of the game each adventure board describes when the game ends, usually when the round counter reaches the end of the track. at this point, all players must convert the treasures they carried out of the district into ducats. any treasures carried by characters that are still in the district are worth nothing. each player loses 3 ducats for each of his characters that failed to leave the district before game end. the player with the most ducats wins the game.the game round spent ap tokens are returned to all players. move the round counter on the adventure board, applying any event on an event square immediately. in clockwise

bank are equal to the full value of the treasure shown, plus the bonus indicated (per treasure). keep your treasures. you may only use one mission card per turn and you cannot hold or save the card to use later. discard a used mission card and replace it with a new one. end of the game when the round counter reaches the end of the round counter track, all players convert the treasures they managed to carry out of the district into ducats. each player loses 3 ducats for each of his characters that failed to leave the district before game end. the player with the most ducats wins.the king of ashes setup set up the base game with the following changes: place the catacombs board next to the main board. choose one of the king of ashes adventure sheets (adventures 9-14), and follow any special setup instructions. place the cyclops in its lair. in addition to the chest tokens from the base game, randomly place 1 exploration token facedown in each of the 24 rooms on the main board. when the chest tokens are flipped faceup, leave the exploration tokens facedown. shuffle the arcana cards (from the base game and this expansion) together. each player draws 5 arcana cards. shuffle the intrigue cards. each player draws 1 intrigue card. keep the rest near the board. place the wound tokens and experience tokens within easy reach. place the equipment cards faceup near the board. each player rolls 2 dice and adds the results. the player with the highest total is the first player. in turn order (going clockwise from the first player), each player may replace one of his characters with the mercenary of his gang’s color, or with sienne or isabeau. the king of ashes campaign four of the new adventure sheets can be played independently, or combined into a single campaign. to play the campaign, play adventures 9–12 in order, starting with the awakening of sophet drahas and building to the conclusion in the price of pride. for a more thematic campaign, it is recommended (but not required) that players use the same gang throughout. a player may replace one of this characters with a mercenary before each adventure. at the end of each game, record which player won, how many ducats each player collected, and the number of unspent experience tokens each player holds. all other treasures and equipment are lost. any characters who were killed or imprisoned are available next game. the winner of each game receives a bonus at the start of the next adventure, as detailed on the adventure sheets. also, all players receive their unused experience tokens from the last adventure, and can use them normally to buy equipment or reroll dice. at the end of the price of pride, the player with the highest total ducats wins the campaign. mercenaries at the beginning of the game, each player may replace one of his characters with the mercenary that matches his gang’s color. instead of choosing the mercenary, a player may choose one of the grey mercenaries, sienne or isabeau. each gang can have 4 four characters at the start of the game (return any unused characters to the box).exploration tokens when a character who is not retreating enters a room with a facedown exploration token, he must immediately end his movement and flip over the token. magic gem to obtain the gem, characters must either pick the lock or bash the chest open, as if it were a normal chest token. trap the character who revealed this token must take 1 wound token and end his activation. then remove the trap token from the game. equipment the player who revealed this token must choose 1 equipment card from those available and give it to the character who revealed this token. if the character already has an equipment card, he must choose which one to keep and remove the other from the game. then remove the equipment token from the game. the emblem of cadwallon the player who revealed this token gains 1 experience token. then remove the emblem token from the game. security picking a lock or bashing open a chest costs 1 extra ap in this room. when the treasure in this room is taken, remove the security token from the game. staircase once revealed, any character can use the staircase to reach an underground room for 1 movement point. the gang that revealed the staircase gains 1 experience token. a character who is retreating cannot move down a staircase. mechanism a character in a room with this token can allow another character on a staircase token to enter the treasure room of sophet drahas. reinforced patrols at the beginning of the game, replace valrut and kornak militia cards with chief valrut and captain kornak militia cards. during the move a militiaman phase, instead of rolling 1 die to move the militia, the current player activates the militiamen according to the color of the arcana card that is on top of the arcana deck during this phase of his turn: if the arcana card has a purple back, the player can move 1 militiaman up to 4 spaces. if the arcana card has a blue back, the militiamen do not move this turn. if a militiaman wins a combat, he takes 2 ducats from the losing player and returns them to the bank as normal. the losing character is also thrown in prison. militiamen cannot be attacked, wounded, or thrown in prison. no mercy wounds characters can be wounded during combat, by a trap, or by the effect of an arcana card. each time a character is wounded, place a wound token on his character card. if a character is wounded during his activation, his activation immediately ends. a character with 1 or more wounds cannot be activated, but he can defend himself if attacked.at any time during his turn, a player may spend aps to heal his characters. remove 1 wound token per ap spent. when all wound tokens have been removed from a character, he can be activated as normal. fighting to a draw if the scores in a combat are tied, the attacker does not automatically win the combat. instead, each player adds together the value of all the dice he rolled. any bonuses from skills or arcana cards are added to this total. the character with the higher total wins the combat. if the scores are still tied, the attacker wins. battle fury players are no longer limited to using only a single arcana card during a combat. each player may play any number of cards. the attacker still plays his cards first. advanced training when a character moves, he can now pass through a space that is occupied by another character from the same gang. however, a character cannot end his movement in the same space as another character from the same gang. when a character passes through a space occupied by another member of the same gang, the 2 characters may exchange any or all of the treasures and/or equipment they are carrying. at the end of the exchange, neither character can have more than 3 treasures and 1 equipment card. learning from experience when a character attacks, his gang gains 1 experience token for each unmodified 6 he rolls with the combat dice. the defender in the combat cannot gain experience tokens in this way, only the attacker. you can spend 1 experience token to reroll 1 of his dice. it can be rerolled only once, and you must accept the result of the second roll. on your turn, you may spend 2 experience tokens to equip a character in your gang. you can choose 1 equipment card from those available and give it to a character of your choice. equipment cards each character can have only 1 equipment card at a time. if a character receives a second equipment card, you must choose which to keep; the other card is removed from the game. most equipment cards can be used an unlimited number of times during the game. however, an equipment card that says discard after one use can be used only once and must then be removed from the game. intrigue cards intrigue cards are secret secondary missions that a gang can complete. they are kept secret from the other players until they are completed. you may never have more than 3 intrigue cards at one time. each card shows a condition and a reward. when you accomplish all of the conditions on a card, reveal it, take the reward, and then discard the card.some intrigue cards have an end of game penalty. if you do not fulfill all the conditions on the card before the end of the game, you lose ducats. if a card says play this card at the end of the game, determine whether the conditions on the card have been fulfilled before you lose ducats. you can spend 1 ap to draw 1 intrigue card if you have a character in any of these locations: the guardroom the magician’s chamber the treasury the dormitory the library the laboratory old city, new tricks follow these rules to play the rules in this expansion with the 8 adventures from the base game. the catacombs are not used. use the base game character cards for the militiamen and move them following the base game rules. ignore the skills printed on mercenary character cards.remove these arcana cards from the game: subtle watchman, breakout, private security, spiked grog. remove these equipment cards from the game: axe, lantern. remove these intrigue cards from the game: map the catacombs, find a safe place to hide, claim a bounty, enlist a magician’s aid, take your share, acquire useful potions, escape a slaver’s clutches, slay the cyclops. remove the magic gem, mechanism, and stair exploration tokens and shuffle the rest facedown. each player, in turn order, takes 1 exploration token and, without looking at it, places it 1 room of his choice. there can be only 1 exploration token per room. special rules apply to adventures 2 and 3 from the base game: the ring of assassins isabeau must use the base game character card and cannot be chosen as a mercenary for this adventure. night of the long cutlasses sienne and isabeau cannot be chosen as mercenaries for this adventure. the guild of jewelers must use the base game character cards for sienne, isabeau, kornak and valrut. kornak and valrut do not use the arcana deck for movement. follow the instructions on the adventure sheet. optional rules the inn during setup, before characters are placed on the board, each player has the option of choosing 2 equipment cards. place all equipment cards faceup on the table. beginning with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player chooses 1 equipment card from those available. after each player has selected 1 card, beginning with the last player and proceeding counter-clockwise, each player chooses a second equipment card from those available. you are not required to take an equipment card and you may skip your turn instead. you may choose to play with only 1 equipment card, or none at all. at the end of the game, before the game winner is determined, all players must pay a debt of 2 ducats for each equipment card he chose at the beginning of the game. all equipment cards taken must be paid for, even if they were not used during play. the catacombs of cadwallon the lair the cyclops begins the game in the lair. when the cyclops loses a combat, return it to the lair. characters cannot enter the lair. the prison when a character is thrown in prison, move the character’s figure directly to this room. while a character is in prison, he cannot move or perform any actions other than attempt to escape. there is no limit to the number of characters who can be in this room, and they cannot attack each other. when a character in prison is activated, he can spend 1 ap to attempt an escape by rolling 1 die: 1-3: the attempt fails. the character cannot move this turn. he must stay in prison until the next round, and the ap spent to move is lost. 4-6: the attempt succeeds. the character may immediately move from the prison to the pentacle and back to the surface by spending movement points as normal. if the character is carrying 1 or more bunches of keys, he may reroll the die once. attempting to escape from prison is a move action. after a character has escaped and moved a number of spaces up to his movement value, he may take another action as normal, but he may not take an additional move action. the torture chamber if a character is in the torture chamber, he can spend 1 ap to steal 1 treasure of his choice from any character in the prison. the tunnel if the alarm has been raised, a character in the tunnel can spend 1 ap to leave the district, but he must roll 1 die: 1: the character is lost. remove his figure and all treasure and equipment he carries from the game. his gang also loses 3 ducats. 2-3: the character narrowly escapes, but not before losing any 2 treasures he carries (player’s choice). 4-6: the character makes a clean getaway and leaves the district with all of his treasures.the scriptorium if a character is in the scriptorium, he can spend 1 ap to read the forbidden tomes. roll 1 die: if the result is less than or equal to the character’s mind value, he can choose 3 arcana cards from the discard pile and add them to his hand. his gang also gains 1 experience token. if the result is higher than the character’s mind value, he draws 2 arcana cards from the deck. if the character is carrying 1 or more scrolls, he may reroll the die once. the character must leave the catacombs and return to the scriptorium before he can read them again. the holy altar if a character is in the holy altar, he can spend 1 ap to convert any magic gems he carries into ducats. take 6 ducats from the bank for each magic gem the character is carrying. the magic gems are then removed from the game. the treasure room of sophet drahas a character in a room with a staircase token can enter the treasure room only if another member of his gang is in a room with a mechanism token. if a character is in the treasure room, he can spend 1 ap to loot the treasure. the player must roll 3 dice: if the result of 2 or 3 dice are the same number, the thief is killed on the spot by magical traps. remove the figure from the game, along with all treasures and equipment he was carrying. if the result of all 3 dice are different, add the value of each die together. the player receives that many ducats from the bank. if the character is carrying 1 or more bracelets, he may reroll 1 of the dice once. if a character is killed, the gang does not lose 3 ducats for that character’s failure to leave the district. after looting the treasure room, the character must leave the catacombs and return before he can rob the treasure room again.the catacombs of cadwallon entering and leaving the catacombs a character may move from a room with a staircase exploration token to the catacombs for 1 movement point. the character can move directly to any of the following rooms: the holy altar the scriptorium the tunnel the treasure room the torture chamber of sophet drahas this ends the character’s movement for the turn. note that in order to move to the treasure room of sophet drahas, another character from the same gang must be in a room with a mechanism token. characters can only move in the catacombs by following the direction of the green arrows. if a character reaches the pentacle in the center of the catacombs, he must move directly to any pentacle on the main board for 1 movement point. a character can only move to an empty pentacle space. if all of the pentacle spaces are occupied by other characters, place the character in an empty space adjacent to any pentacle. after moving to the surface, the character may spend any movement points he has left to continue moving. special rules in the catacombs militiamen cannot enter the catacombs. if a character uses a staircase to move into a room that is occupied by the cyclops, he must spend 1 ap to attack. the cyclops does not move. if a character uses a staircase to move into a room that is occupied by an enemy character, he must spend 1 ap to attack. this combat occurs before the cyclops moves. when a combat takes place in the catacombs, the loser is thrown in prison, and the winner steals 1 treasure from him, or 2 ducats if the loser has no treasure.the cyclops of mid-nôr when a character enters any room in the catacombs, other than the room the cyclops is currently in, the player must roll 1 die to see where the cyclops figure is placed. experience tokens can be spent to reroll this die. 1: the holy altar. 2: the tunnel. 3: the torture chamber.4: the scriptorium. 5: the treasure room of sophet drahas. 6: the cyclops is distracted and does not move. the cyclops moves directly to its new location without moving through any passageways in the catacombs or through the central room. if the cyclops appears in a room that is occupied by a character, combat immediately takes place with the cyclops as the attacker. if a character moves into a room the cyclops occupies, he must spend 1 ap to attack and the cyclops is the defender. a player not involved in the combat rolls the dice for the cyclops. if the cyclops wins the combat, the losing character is thrown in prison. if the cyclops loses the combat, a second combat round begins immediately. if the cyclops wins the second combat round, the losing character is thrown in prison. if the cyclops loses the second combat round, it immediately returns to the lair. arcana cards can be played in both combat rounds, but they only apply for the combat round in which they are played. arcana cards cannot be used to aid the cyclops. the cyclops cannot be wounded or thrown in prison."
59,40765,CLASH OF CULTURES,2012,Z-MAN GAMES,3.5972,360,"setup set up the board as shown in the rules and according to the number of players. place all the unrevealed regions randomly and facedown and each player’s starting region faceup. in 4 player games, determine randomly who sits where. each player takes a player board, player aid, cubes, city pieces and units in a matching color. place the resource tokens, and the happiness and culture indicators, on space 0 of the scale of your player board; except for the food resource which starts on space 2. place a cube on the farming (agriculture) advance and a cube on the mining (construction) advance. every player starts with these advances. place a settlement piece and a settler on the fertile space of your starting region. shuffle all the card decks and place them near the board. each player receives 1 action card and 1 objective card (both hidden to other players). place the turn token on the first space of the turn track. give a randomly determined first player the first player token. basic concepts resources, levels and the scale food, ore and wood are natural resources and ideas and gold are special resources. ideas can be used instead of food when buying advances, and gold is a ‘joker’ resource which can be used instead of any other resource. move the appropriate markers along your player board scale to indicate how many resources you have of each type. the culture and happiness indicators mark the maximum number of culture and mood tokens you can have. when you buy an advance with a blue (culture) or yellow (happiness) outline, move the respective indicator up along the scale. resources and culture/happiness level can never exceed 8 or go lower than 0. regions all regions are separated into 4 spaces, each with 1 terrain type providing a specific natural resource: fertile (food), mountain (ore), forest (wood), sea (food – requires fishing), and barren (food – requires irrigation). cities the size of a city is equal to the number of city pieces it has. the settlement piece is the foundation of all cities and marks who owns the city. the academy (requires writing) generates 2 idea resources when built. the temple (requires myths) generates 1 mood token or 1 culture token when built. the port (requires fishing) allows the city to build ships (and with fishing, the city may collect 1 gold or 1 mood token from a single adjacent sea space instead of food). game round every round players have 3 turns. during a turn, each player, in clockwise order, may perform 3 actions. when each player has had 3 turns, each with 3 actions, the round ends with a status phase. then the next round begins. the turn marker is used to keep track of rounds and turns.actions actions can be performed in any order you wish and multiple times (cultural influence may only succeed once per turn). aaa (as an action) on cards and advances means you can perform the listed special action as an action. advance standard cost: 2 food (or ideas which can substitute food 1:1 when buying an advance). place a cube on the player board next to any advance you buy. if it has either a blue border (culture) or yellow border (happiness), move the corresponding indicator up 1 step on the scale and take 1 token of the matching type. if your culture or happiness level is 8, you still get a token despite the indicator not moving. whenever you get an advance in a new category, you must pick the top advance of the category. thereafter you can buy any one of that category’s advances except for those with a prerequisite. prerequisite advances are in red text. prerequisite city pieces are in yellow text. fishing, writing, tactics and myths each have the name of a city piece next to them. the advance is required in order to increase the size of a city using that city piece. you must have the storage advance to have more than 2 food. the 3 categories with a gray background are government categories. once you have bought the top advance of a government category (specific advances are prerequisites), you can buy new advances within the same category. you can only have advances from 1 government type. if you buy an advance in a second government category, transfer the cubes from the old category to advances of your choice in the new category. advances that grant abilities or effects lasting the whole turn cease to have effect when removed. found city spend an action to found a city on a space where you have a settler. replace the settler with a settlement piece. settlers can only found cities on non-barren land spaces with no cities and no foreign units. founding multiple cities must be done through multiple actions (and multiple settlers). activate city activate a city and do one of the following in that city: collect resources, build units, or increase city size. if you activate the same city another time during the same turn, you must reduce the city’s mood by 1 step at the end of the activation each time you do so. an angry city can only be activated once per turn. collect resources collect a number of resources equal to the size of the city (+1 if the city’s mood is happy and only 1 if angry). collect from the space the city is on and adjacent spaces. you can only collect resources from a given space once per activation. the resource you collect from a space depends on the terrain type. you can never collect resources from spaces with another city (regardless of the owner) or with foreign units. build units you can build a number of units equal to the size of the city (+1 if the city’s mood is happy and only 1 if angry). you can build any combination of units (settlers, armies and ships), but ships can only be built in a city that has a port. new land units are placed in the city; ships in the sea space of the port (a battle then occurs if there is an enemy ship there). you may never have more than 4 army units in the same space (army units on ships don’t count). ships and settlers have no stacking limits.increase city size pay 1 food, 1 ore and 1 wood. choose a city piece and add it to the city. each city piece has a special ability, and requires a specific advance in order to add it to your city. angry cities cannot increase in size. a city can’t grow to a size larger than the total number of cities you have (they do not reduce in size if you subsequently lose cities). cities can only have 1 of each type of city piece. ports can only be built in cities adjacent to a sea space. the port city piece is placed so that it extends into a sea space, which is the space where you place ships built by the city. move units move up to 3 units or groups of units. a group is a number of units moving from the same space to the same space (at the same time). move units/groups in any order you wish. units in the same space do not have to move to the same destination (or at the same time), but are considered 2 or more different groups if they don’t. a battle occurs if your units move into a space with enemy units or cities. resolve battles as they occur; they must be completed before moving further units/groups. you may not move your army units until you have the tactics advance (but you can still build armies and fight if attacked). land movement each land unit or group may move 1 space per move action (though you can move multiple spaces per turn by selecting the move action several times). battles: units that have participated in a battle (including capturing a city) cannot be moved again the same turn. mountains: units that move into a mountain space cannot be moved again the same turn. forests: units that move into a forest space can be moved again, unless this move results in a battle. settlers cannot move into the same space as foreign units or cities unless they are part of an army. ship movement ships can move between any connected sea spaces with a single move action. trace the route, as you must stop and battle if you move into a sea space with a foreign ship. ships that battle other ships cannot be moved again during the same turn. with the navigation advance, your ships can move around the board from one group of sea spaces to the first available sea space or group of sea spaces in the sailed direction. you cannot move past unrevealed regions, but you can move into them as a method of exploring. a ship may transport 2 land units. instead of moving on land, you may move land units onto a ship in an adjacent sea space, or, if they are already on a ship, have them disembark to an adjacent land space. during the same move action you may also move both land units and ships, as long as you move no more than 3 units/groups, and that each unit/group only moves once per action. land units may still leave or enter ships that have participated in a battle (though those who have participated in a battle may not move onto ships). civic improvement increase the mood of a city 1 step by paying a number of mood tokens equal to the city’s size. if you have enough mood tokens you may, during one action, increase the mood of as many cities as you want, by as many steps as you want.a city’s mood is either neutral (how all cities start – no mood token), angry (red mood token) or happy (yellow mood token). cultural influence use one of your cities to exert cultural influence over another city. the target city must be at least size 2 and within range of your city. the range is equal to your city’s actual unmodified size. roll a die: a roll of 5 or 6 is a success. exchange 1 of the city’s non-settlement city pieces into your color; gaining a vp at the expense of the city’s owner (or another player who had the piece under his influence). it does not matter which city piece you exchange; to the owner of the city, the piece itself still functions normally, unless specifically stated otherwise. influence attempts can be boosted by spending culture tokens: increase range: +1 space per culture token spent. add to die result: +1 per culture token spent (may be spent after rolling). you can only make 1 successful cultural influence action per turn (but you may use several actions to get that one success). a city with a foreign piece may not be used to make a cultural influence attempt. you may target your own cities to remove foreign cultural influence. cultural influence may cross sea spaces, but not unrevealed regions. status phase all players (in turn order, beginning with the current starting player) complete the first stage, before moving on to the second stage, and so on. 1. completed objectives? players declare if they have completed any objectives. completed objectives are placed in front of the player. there is no limit to how many objective cards can be fulfilled, but only one of a card’s two objectives can be completed. after the 6th round or if a player has no cities, the game ends after this step of the status phase. 2. receive a free advance each player receives 1 free advance. if the new advance results in an event, resolve it immediately. action cards meant to be played upon getting an advance may also be used at this point (but after an event, if any). 3. draw cards all players draw 1 action card and 1 objective card. there is no hand size limit. 4. raze size 1 city players may raze one of their size 1 cities, removing it from the board, and getting 1 gold compensation. this is useful if a city is blocking a larger city’s access to resources or if the player does not expect or want to defend it. 5. determine first player the player with the highest combined culture and happiness levels decides who will be the starting player in the following round (on a tie, the first tied player to the left of the current first player gets to decide). if no one has a combined total larger than the current first player, the turn order remains the same. combat land combat each combat round, players make a combat roll by rolling an amount of dice equal to the number of army units they have in the battle. the sum of that roll is the combat value (cv). divide the cv by 5 to get the number of hits (round down). both players remove 1 army unit per hit they receive. if a side loses all his units, he has lost the battle. if both sides lose all their units, combat ends with no winner or loser. if both sides still have units, a new combat round takes place unless the attacker chooses to cease the attack. the attacker may cease the attack after each combat round. if so, combat ends and the attacking units return to where they came from. all units in the battle must retreat from the battle together. players with the tactics (warfare) advance may play 1 action card each round for its combat effect. the attacker declares first if he wishes to play a card, followed by the defender. a combat card only affects the combat round it is played. a combat card indicates which type of unit (or fortress) that can benefit from the card: army, fortress, or ship. capturing cities a city is captured if your army units are alone in a foreign city. exchange the owner’s city pieces with matching pieces in your color. city pieces under cultural influence by other players are not replaced. if the city was happy or neutral when attacked: 1. spoils of war: you receive x gold (x equals the city’s size). 2. refugees: the previous owner gets a settler in a city of his choice (if he has no cities left, he gets no settler). 3. the city becomes angry. if you do not have the prerequisite advance for a city piece in a captured city, you cannot use that city piece’s special power, nor does it count toward the completion of objectives that require these city pieces. they do, however, still count toward city-size and vp at the end of the game. if you capture a city containing city pieces that you have run out of, then these are removed from the captured city. if you are missing the settlement city piece, the entire city is removed. every city piece removed in this manner gives you a 1 gold compensation. settlers in combat settlers cannot fight. if settlers end up in a space alone with a foreign army unit, a battle occurs in which any settlers are defeated automatically (no cards are played or dice rolled). settlers together with friendly armies are eliminated if the army is eliminated. a settler moving with an army also moves back to where it came from if the army ceases to attack. naval combat a naval battle occurs if you move or build ships into a sea space with an enemy ship. combat is handled as above and ships may also cease to attack and move back to the space from which they started their movement. land units transported by ships play no role during naval combat. however, when a ship takes a hit and is eliminated, any land units on the ship are also eliminated. while a ship cannot be moved again after it has been in a battle, units on board may still enter or leave the ships during a move action. if the units disembark onto a space containing enemy units, a land battle occurs as normal.barbarians barbarians can enter the game in 2 ways: event cards and exploration. when exploring, if you reveal a region with a barbarian icon in the middle, place a barbarian settlement and a barbarian unit on one of the fertile spaces of that region (exploring player’s choice, though never the space that the settler entered). barbarians attack! barbarians mostly attack due to event cards, but can also attack through the mercenaries action card. a barbarian attack follows normal combat rules except: the battle lasts only 1 combat round.hits are applied to units in the city if any (settlers or armies— target’s choice). once there are no more units to absorb hits, each hit reduces the size of the city by 1 step (by removing a city piece). if reduced below size 1, the city is destroyed. a fortress still cancels a hit/attacks the first round. if the city is reduced by 1 or more sizes, it becomes angry. any surviving barbarians end up in their settlement after the first round of combat. attacking a barbarian settlement if you move your units into a barbarian settlement, combat begins as normal. one of the other players rolls the dice for the barbarians, but cannot play action cards for them. if you move army units into an undefended barbarian settlement or defeat all the opposition, you capture it. you earn 1 gold for every barbarian defeated in the battle. then either: 1. keep the city (change to your color) and make it angry, or 2. raze the city (remove it from the board) and earn an additional 1 gold. event cards when your culture or happiness level reaches 3, 5 or 7, draw an event card and resolve it immediately. both indicators activate an event. if an event card forces all players to do something, this is done in turn order, starting with the first player. icons in the top right corner denote special effects which are resolved just after drawing the card. they are always and only resolved when the card is drawn, even if the main effect of the card does not occur until later in the game. event icons only affect the player who drew the card. gold mine! receive 2 gold immediately. exhausted! place an exhausted resource token on an empty (no units/cities), non-barren land space adjacent to one of your cities. no resources may be collected from that space, and no cities may be founded there (including barbarians). the irrigation advance has no effect on a space with this token. barbarians spawn do the following in this order: 1. place a barbarian settlement and a barbarian together on an empty (no units/cities), non-barren land space within 2 spaces of one of your cities. 2. place a barbarian unit in a barbarian settlement of your choice (including the new settlement). barbarian attack do the following in this order: 1. find the barbarian settlements within 2 spaces of your cities, even across sea spaces (no crossing unrevealed regions). 2. of these, the settlement with the most barbarians attacks the closest of your cities. if tied for size or range, then you decide which of the tied settlements attacks which of your tied cities. objective cards each player starts the game with 1 objective card and receives further objectives during the status phase. objective cards are kept hidden from the other players. when you complete an objective, place it in front of you. objective cards have 2 objectives on them. only 1 of the 2 objectives on a single card can be completed. some are completed during the first step of the status phase, while others are completed immediately after specific criteria are fulfilled. multiples of the same objective (objectives with the same name) can never be completed at the same time with the same trigger. when you complete an objective, place it in front of you. action cards players start the game with 1 action card and get new ones mainly during the status phase. the action card lists the effect and when you can play it. discard an action card after playing it. there is no limit to how many action cards you can play for their non-combat effect (aside from the limits presented on the cards). however, you may not play 2 of the same cards during the same trigger. if you have the tactics (warfare) advance, you may play action cards for their combat effect (on the lower half). player trades during your turn, you may trade with other players. you may also trade with a player during that player’s turn. you may trade (at whatever cost you can agree on): resources; action cards; objective cards; mood tokens; and culture tokens. trade deals with an immediate transaction of the above items must be fulfilled. verbal agreements of a diplomatic/ political kind, as well as loans and transactions to happen at a later time, are not enforced by the game. only the players’ conscience and goals determine their validity. wonders there are 7 wonders in the game, each represented by a card and a vertical token. wonders are revealed by the engineering and monuments advances. this means taking the top wonder card and placing it faceup on the table. any player may build a revealed wonder on their turn by fulfilling the requirements and paying the cost. any specific wonder can only be built by 1 player. once built, that wonder card is placed next to their player board, and the corresponding vertical token is placed in one of their cities. the wonder itself does not add to the size of the city, or affect it in any way unless stated on the specific wonder card. a city can only have 1 wonder. if the city is destroyed, you lose the wonder (and its vp). if you lose the city to another player, the conqueror gets the wonder and its vp. exploration reveal regions by moving units into them. armies, ships and settlers can be used to explore a region, but only a settler can found a city. a revealed region is placed as follows: 1. the space which was moved into may not be a sea space.2. a sea space must be placed adjacent to another sea space (unless this conflicts with rule 1). 3. if sea spaces cannot be placed adjacent to other sea spaces, and the region is on the edge of the board, place the region so that a sea space, if any, touches the edge of the board. if after following these rules there remains 2 ways to rotate the region, you may rotate it as you see fit. remember to add a barbarian settlement and a barbarian unit whenever a revealed region has a barbarian icon in the middle. exploring with a ship when exploring with a ship, reveal a region that the ship can reach. place the region so that its sea spaces can be reached by the ship without entering any other regions. if that is not possible, then place it in accordance with the normal rules, and move the ship back to the sea space it started from. the same rules apply when you use the navigation advance to move around the edge of the board. winning the game the game ends after 6 rounds, or before that if one of the players has no cities left when entering the status phase. the winner is the player with the most victory points (vp). each player counts his vp (including half points): 1 vp per city piece of yours on the board ½ vp for each advance you have 5 vp per wonder 2 vp per objective event cards that offer vp on a tie, whoever built the great pyramids wonder wins. otherwise, go through the above list one by one starting from the top: the winner is the player with the most points from city pieces, then if tied, the most points from advances, and so on. if still tied, it is a joint victory. variants events 1. no events: draw events, but only for the effect of the event icons (such as barbarians). 2. optional events: rather than being forced to draw an event card, players can decide to draw if they want to push their luck. if they decline, a card is still drawn, but only for the effect of the event icons. 4 round game for a shorter 4 round game, start with 2 settlers and 1 happy city. during the free advance step of the status phase, players get 2 advances instead of 1. each player gets his first advance in turn order, then continue to the second advance, also in turn order. variable end game to introduce some uncertainty about when the game ends, use the back side of the turn track that goes up to 7 rounds. the first player about to start one of the last 5 turns rolls a die, and if the die result is within the depicted range, the game ends immediately and points are counted. alternatively, rather than rolling, the game ends if a player builds a wonder during one of the last 5 turns. once the wonder is built, players finish this turn and points are counted immediately after the turn where the wonder was built (before the status phase). game round actions advance standard cost: 2 food (or ideas which can substitute food 1:1 when buying an advance). place a cube next to any advance you buy. if it has a blue (culture) or yellow (happiness) border, move the corresponding indicator up 1 step and take 1 token of the matching type. whenever you get an advance in a new category, you must pick the top advance of the category. then you can buy any one of that category’s advances except for those with a prerequisite. prerequisite advances are in red text. prerequisite city pieces are in yellow text. you need the storage advance to have more than 2 food. you can only have advances from 1 government type. found city found a city on a space where you have a settler. replace the settler with a settlement piece. settlers can only found cities on non-barren land spaces with no cities and no foreign units. activate city activate a city collect resources; build units; or increase city size in that city. if you activate the same city again during the same turn, reduce its mood by 1 step at the end of the activation. an angry city can only be activated once per turn. collect resources collect resources equal to the size of the city (+1 if the city’s mood is happy and only 1 if angry) from the space the city is on and adjacent spaces. you can only collect resources from a given space once per activation. the resource you collect depends on the terrain type. you can never collect resources from spaces with another city or with foreign units. build units build units equal to the size of the city (+1 if the city’s mood is happy and only 1 if angry). ships can only be built in a city that has a port. you may never have more than 4 army units in the same space (army units on ships don’t count). ships and settlers have no stacking limits. increase city size pay 1 food, 1 ore and 1 wood and add a city piece. each has a special ability, and requires a specific advance. angry cities cannot increase in size. a city can’t grow to a size larger than the total number of cities you have. cities can only have 1 of each type of city piece. ports can only be built in cities adjacent to a sea space. move units move up to 3 units or groups of units. a battle occurs if your units move into a space with enemy units or cities. you may not move your army units until you have the tactics advance (but you can still build armies and defend).land movement each land unit/group may move 1 space per move action. battles: units that have participated in a battle (including capturing a city) cannot be moved again the same turn. mountains: units that move into a mountain space cannot be moved again the same turn. forests: units that move into a forest space can be moved again, unless this move results in a battle. settlers cannot move into the same space as foreign units or cities unless they are part of an army. ship movement ships can move between any connected sea spaces with a single move action. you must stop and battle if you move into a sea space with a foreign ship. ships that battle other ships cannot be moved again during the same turn. with the navigation advance, ships can move around the board from one group of sea spaces to the first available sea space(s) in the sailed direction. a ship may transport 2 land units. civic improvement increase the mood of a city 1 step by paying mood tokens equal to the city’s size. cultural influence use one of your cities to exert cultural influence over another city of at least size 2 and within range of your city. the range is equal to your city’s actual unmodified size. roll a die: a roll of 5 or 6 is a success. exchange 1 of the city’s non-settlement city pieces into your color; gaining a vp from the player who had the piece under his influence. boost influence attempts by spending culture tokens: increase range: +1 space per token. add to die result: +1 per token (may spend after rolling). you can only make 1 successful cultural influence action per turn, and may target your own cities to remove foreign cultural influence. status phase 1. completed objectives? players declare if they have completed any objectives. only one of a card’s two objectives can be completed. after the 6th round or if a player has no cities, the game ends after this step of the status phase. 2. receive a free advance each player receives 1 free advance. if the new advance results in an event, resolve it immediately. 3. draw cards all players draw 1 action card and 1 objective card. 4. raze size 1 city players may raze one of their size 1 cities, removing it from the board, and getting 1 gold compensation. 5. determine first player the player with the highest combined culture and happiness levels decides who will be the starting player in the following round. game round actions advance standard cost: 2 food (or ideas which can substitute food 1:1 when buying an advance). place a cube next to any advance you buy. if it has a blue (culture) or yellow (happiness) border, move the corresponding indicator up 1 step and take 1 token of the matching type. whenever you get an advance in a new category, you must pick the top advance of the category. then you can buy any one of that category’s advances except for those with a prerequisite. prerequisite advances are in red text. prerequisite city pieces are in yellow text. you need the storage advance to have more than 2 food. you can only have advances from 1 government type. found city found a city on a space where you have a settler. replace the settler with a settlement piece. settlers can only found cities on non-barren land spaces with no cities and no foreign units. activate city activate a city collect resources; build units; or increase city size in that city. if you activate the same city again during the same turn, reduce its mood by 1 step at the end of the activation. an angry city can only be activated once per turn. collect resources collect resources equal to the size of the city (+1 if the city’s mood is happy and only 1 if angry) from the space the city is on and adjacent spaces. you can only collect resources from a given space once per activation. the resource you collect depends on the terrain type. you can never collect resources from spaces with another city or with foreign units. build units build units equal to the size of the city (+1 if the city’s mood is happy and only 1 if angry). ships can only be built in a city that has a port. you may never have more than 4 army units in the same space (army units on ships don’t count). ships and settlers have no stacking limits. increase city size pay 1 food, 1 ore and 1 wood and add a city piece. each has a special ability, and requires a specific advance. angry cities cannot increase in size. a city can’t grow to a size larger than the total number of cities you have. cities can only have 1 of each type of city piece. ports can only be built in cities adjacent to a sea space. move units move up to 3 units or groups of units. a battle occurs if your units move into a space with enemy units or cities. you may not move your army units until you have the tactics advance (but you can still build armies and defend).land movement each land unit/group may move 1 space per move action. battles: units that have participated in a battle (including capturing a city) cannot be moved again the same turn. mountains: units that move into a mountain space cannot be moved again the same turn. forests: units that move into a forest space can be moved again, unless this move results in a battle. settlers cannot move into the same space as foreign units or cities unless they are part of an army. ship movement ships can move between any connected sea spaces with a single move action. you must stop and battle if you move into a sea space with a foreign ship. ships that battle other ships cannot be moved again during the same turn. with the navigation advance, ships can move around the board from one group of sea spaces to the first available sea space(s) in the sailed direction. a ship may transport 2 land units. civic improvement increase the mood of a city 1 step by paying mood tokens equal to the city’s size. cultural influence use one of your cities to exert cultural influence over another city of at least size 2 and within range of your city. the range is equal to your city’s actual unmodified size. roll a die: a roll of 5 or 6 is a success. exchange 1 of the city’s non-settlement city pieces into your color; gaining a vp from the player who had the piece under his influence. boost influence attempts by spending culture tokens: increase range: +1 space per token. add to die result: +1 per token (may spend after rolling). you can only make 1 successful cultural influence action per turn, and may target your own cities to remove foreign cultural influence. status phase 1. completed objectives? players declare if they have completed any objectives. only one of a card’s two objectives can be completed. after the 6th round or if a player has no cities, the game ends after this step of the status phase. 2. receive a free advance each player receives 1 free advance. if the new advance results in an event, resolve it immediately. 3. draw cards all players draw 1 action card and 1 objective card. 4. raze size 1 city players may raze one of their size 1 cities, removing it from the board, and getting 1 gold compensation. 5. determine first player the player with the highest combined culture and happiness levels decides who will be the starting player in the following round. combat land combat each combat round, players roll dice equal to the number of army units they have in the battle. the sum of that roll is the combat value (cv). divide the cv by 5 for the number of hits (round down). remove 1 army unit per hit. if both sides still have units, a new combat round starts. the attacker may cease the attack after each combat round. combat ends and all the attacking units return to where they came from. players with the tactics (warfare) advance may play 1 action card each round for its combat effect. the attacker declares first. a combat card only affects the combat round it is played and indicates which type of unit benefits from the card. settlers cannot fight. capturing cities a foreign city is captured if your army units are alone in it. exchange the owner’s city pieces with matching pieces in your color. city pieces under cultural influence by other players are not replaced. if the city was happy or neutral when attacked you receive x gold (x equals the city’s size) and the city becomes angry. the previous owner gets a settler in a city of his choice (if he has no cities left, he gets no settler). naval combat a naval battle occurs if you move or build ships into a sea space with an enemy ship. ships may also cease to attack and return to the space from which they started moving. land units transported by ships play no role during naval combat, but when a ship takes a hit and is eliminated, any land units on the ship are also eliminated. barbarians when exploring, if you reveal a region with a barbarian icon in the middle, place a barbarian settlement and a barbarian unit on one of the fertile spaces of that region. a barbarian attack follows normal combat rules except the battle lasts only 1 combat round, and hits are applied to units in the city if any (settlers or armies—target’s choice). once there are no more units to absorb hits, each hit reduces the size of the city by 1 step. a fortress still cancels a hit/attacks the first round. if the city is reduced by 1 or more sizes, it becomes angry. if you move your units into a barbarian settlement, begin normal combat. if you move army units into an undefended barbarian settlement or defeat all the opposition, you capture it. earn 1 gold for every barbarian defeated in the battle. then either keep the city (change to your color) and make it angry, or raze the city (remove it from the board) and earn an additional 1 gold.event cards when your culture or happiness level reaches 3, 5 or 7, draw an event card and resolve it immediately. gold mine! receive 2 gold immediately. exhausted! place an exhausted resource token on an empty (no units/cities), non-barren land space adjacent to one of your cities. no resources may be collected from that space, and no cities may be founded there (including barbarians). the irrigation advance has no effect on a space with this token. barbarians spawn 1. place a barbarian settlement and a barbarian together on an empty (no units/cities), non- barren land space within 2 spaces of one of your cities. 2. place a barbarian unit in a barbarian settlement of your choice (including the new settlement). barbarian attack: 1. find the barbarian settlements within 2 spaces of your cities, even across sea spaces (no crossing unrevealed regions). 2. of these, the settlement with the most barbarians attacks the closest of your cities. objective cards only 1 of the 2 objectives on a single card can be completed. multiples of the same objective can never be completed at the same time with the same trigger. wonders wonders are revealed by the engineering and monuments advances. any player may build a revealed wonder on their turn by fulfilling the requirements and paying the cost. any specific wonder can only be built by 1 player and a city can only have 1 wonder. if the city is destroyed, you lose the wonder (and its vp). if you lose the city to another player, the conqueror gets the wonder and its vp.combat land combat each combat round, players roll dice equal to the number of army units they have in the battle. the sum of that roll is the combat value (cv). divide the cv by 5 for the number of hits (round down). remove 1 army unit per hit. if both sides still have units, a new combat round starts. the attacker may cease the attack after each combat round. combat ends and all the attacking units return to where they came from. players with the tactics (warfare) advance may play 1 action card each round for its combat effect. the attacker declares first. a combat card only affects the combat round it is played and indicates which type of unit benefits from the card. settlers cannot fight. capturing cities a foreign city is captured if your army units are alone in it. exchange the owner’s city pieces with matching pieces in your color. city pieces under cultural influence by other players are not replaced. if the city was happy or neutral when attacked you receive x gold (x equals the city’s size) and the city becomes angry. the previous owner gets a settler in a city of his choice (if he has no cities left, he gets no settler). naval combat a naval battle occurs if you move or build ships into a sea space with an enemy ship. ships may also cease to attack and return to the space from which they started moving. land units transported by ships play no role during naval combat, but when a ship takes a hit and is eliminated, any land units on the ship are also eliminated. barbarians when exploring, if you reveal a region with a barbarian icon in the middle, place a barbarian settlement and a barbarian unit on one of the fertile spaces of that region. a barbarian attack follows normal combat rules except the battle lasts only 1 combat round, and hits are applied to units in the city if any (settlers or armies—target’s choice). once there are no more units to absorb hits, each hit reduces the size of the city by 1 step. a fortress still cancels a hit/attacks the first round. if the city is reduced by 1 or more sizes, it becomes angry. if you move your units into a barbarian settlement, begin normal combat. if you move army units into an undefended barbarian settlement or defeat all the opposition, you capture it. earn 1 gold for every barbarian defeated in the battle. then either keep the city (change to your color) and make it angry, or raze the city (remove it from the board) and earn an additional 1 gold.event cards when your culture or happiness level reaches 3, 5 or 7, draw an event card and resolve it immediately. gold mine! receive 2 gold immediately. exhausted! place an exhausted resource token on an empty (no units/cities), non-barren land space adjacent to one of your cities. no resources may be collected from that space, and no cities may be founded there (including barbarians). the irrigation advance has no effect on a space with this token. barbarians spawn 1. place a barbarian settlement and a barbarian together on an empty (no units/cities), non- barren land space within 2 spaces of one of your cities. 2. place a barbarian unit in a barbarian settlement of your choice (including the new settlement). barbarian attack: 1. find the barbarian settlements within 2 spaces of your cities, even across sea spaces (no crossing unrevealed regions). 2. of these, the settlement with the most barbarians attacks the closest of your cities. objective cards only 1 of the 2 objectives on a single card can be completed. multiples of the same objective can never be completed at the same time with the same trigger. wonders wonders are revealed by the engineering and monuments advances. any player may build a revealed wonder on their turn by fulfilling the requirements and paying the cost. any specific wonder can only be built by 1 player and a city can only have 1 wonder. if the city is destroyed, you lose the wonder (and its vp). if you lose the city to another player, the conqueror gets the wonder and its vp. civilizations setup shuffle the new event cards into the event deck. some of the new cards have 2 event icons; resolve the top one first. shuffle the new objective cards into the objective deck. set up the basic game. then: each player gets 2 random civilization boards and selects one. simultaneously reveal the choices and place your board next to your player board. return the unchosen boards to the box. each player takes the 3 leader cards matching their civilization and draws one at random. place it above the civilization board and keep the remaining leader cards facedown within reach. places your leader miniature in your starting city (leaders are represented by a settler miniature in a different shade of your player color). remove 2 of each type of settlement piece from the base game. some civilizations use an alternate starting region, as shown on their civilization board. for these, replace the normal starting region with the matching alternate starting region. special advances category each civilization has a special advances category with 4 unique special advances. these are obtained by buying basic advances, listed in green with each special advance. as soon as you gain the appropriate basic advance, also place a cube in the special advance to show that you now have the special advance as well. there is no other prerequisite or special order needed to buy them. like basic advances, each special advance counts as ½ a vp each. if you lose the basic advance that gave you the special advance, you also lose that special advance. the lost special advance is immediately regained if that basic advance is reacquired. the special advances category counts as an advance category for the objectives focused and balanced. if a special advance lists a government category rather than a specific advance, this means that the top advance within that government category gives you access to the special advance. leaders leaders aren’t units (advances, cards, powers etc that refer to a unit do not refer to leaders unless specified) but they move like one, lending their abilities to nearby units and cities. each leader has 2 abilities listed on its leader card. if an ability refers to the leader’s army, ships, or city, this means the army or ships in the leader’s space, or the city the leader is in. abilities that add to the cv add to it every combat round unless otherwise noted. movement leaders behave exactly like settlers in regards to movement, except they don’t take up any space on ships.death leaders can’t fight on their own, and are eliminated in battle just like settler units (including during barbarian attacks). they can also die from event cards that specifically target leaders. when your leader dies, remove the miniature from the board and discard the leader card from above your civilization board. if you kill an enemy leader in a land or sea battle, take its leader card and place it in front of you with your completed objectives, where it counts as 2 vp. getting a new leader as a last step in the status phase, you can get a new leader if you wish. if your leader is still alive, discard your current leader card and remove your leader miniature from the board. draw a new random leader from your unused leader cards and place it above your civilization board. place the leader miniature in any of your cities. a discarded or killed leader cannot enter the game again at a later point. city pieces the 3 new city pieces are used in the same way as the pieces from the base game. each city can still only have 4 city pieces in addition to the central settlement piece. market (requires bartering advance) cities with a market may build cavalry and elephant units. get 1 gold each time an opponent uses trade routes with one or more of your cities with a market (only 1 gold, even if an opponent trades with more than one of your market cities). a player may choose not to use a trade route that connects with an opponents’ city with a market. obelisk (requires art & sculptures advance) this city piece is immune to cultural influence, and remains in the builder’s color even if the city is captured. a captured city with an obelisk in another color is considered to be under cultural influence by the obelisk’s builder. apothecary (requires mathematics advance) after a battle or an event card where you lost land units, you may pay 1 food (you may pay with gold instead, as normal) for each lost unit you wish to place in a city with an apothecary (1 unit per apothecary). units that moved on your turn are still regarded as having moved after appearing in an apothecary. units revived by an apothecary still count as being eliminated or defeated in battle. you always revive the exact same units that were lost. so for the black death event, you would remove the units from the event card when reviving them. players who capture a city with an apothecary may use it immediately to revive units they lost in the battle. civilizations setup shuffle the new event cards into the event deck. some of the new cards have 2 event icons; resolve the top one first. shuffle the new objective cards into the objective deck. set up the basic game. then: each player gets 2 random civilization boards and selects one. simultaneously reveal the choices and place your board next to your player board. return the unchosen boards to the box. each player takes the 3 leader cards matching their civilization and draws one at random. place it above the civilization board and keep the remaining leader cards facedown within reach. places your leader miniature in your starting city (leaders are represented by a settler miniature in a different shade of your player color). remove 2 of each type of settlement piece from the base game. some civilizations use an alternate starting region, as shown on their civilization board. for these, replace the normal starting region with the matching alternate starting region. special advances category each civilization has a special advances category with 4 unique special advances. these are obtained by buying basic advances, listed in green with each special advance. as soon as you gain the appropriate basic advance, also place a cube in the special advance to show that you now have the special advance as well. there is no other prerequisite or special order needed to buy them. like basic advances, each special advance counts as ½ a vp each. if you lose the basic advance that gave you the special advance, you also lose that special advance. the lost special advance is immediately regained if that basic advance is reacquired. the special advances category counts as an advance category for the objectives focused and balanced. if a special advance lists a government category rather than a specific advance, this means that the top advance within that government category gives you access to the special advance. leaders leaders aren’t units (advances, cards, powers etc that refer to a unit do not refer to leaders unless specified) but they move like one, lending their abilities to nearby units and cities. each leader has 2 abilities listed on its leader card. if an ability refers to the leader’s army, ships, or city, this means the army or ships in the leader’s space, or the city the leader is in. abilities that add to the cv add to it every combat round unless otherwise noted. movement leaders behave exactly like settlers in regards to movement, except they don’t take up any space on ships.death leaders can’t fight on their own, and are eliminated in battle just like settler units (including during barbarian attacks). they can also die from event cards that specifically target leaders. when your leader dies, remove the miniature from the board and discard the leader card from above your civilization board. if you kill an enemy leader in a land or sea battle, take its leader card and place it in front of you with your completed objectives, where it counts as 2 vp. getting a new leader as a last step in the status phase, you can get a new leader if you wish. if your leader is still alive, discard your current leader card and remove your leader miniature from the board. draw a new random leader from your unused leader cards and place it above your civilization board. place the leader miniature in any of your cities. a discarded or killed leader cannot enter the game again at a later point. city pieces the 3 new city pieces are used in the same way as the pieces from the base game. each city can still only have 4 city pieces in addition to the central settlement piece. market (requires bartering advance) cities with a market may build cavalry and elephant units. get 1 gold each time an opponent uses trade routes with one or more of your cities with a market (only 1 gold, even if an opponent trades with more than one of your market cities). a player may choose not to use a trade route that connects with an opponents’ city with a market. obelisk (requires art & sculptures advance) this city piece is immune to cultural influence, and remains in the builder’s color even if the city is captured. a captured city with an obelisk in another color is considered to be under cultural influence by the obelisk’s builder. apothecary (requires mathematics advance) after a battle or an event card where you lost land units, you may pay 1 food (you may pay with gold instead, as normal) for each lost unit you wish to place in a city with an apothecary (1 unit per apothecary). units that moved on your turn are still regarded as having moved after appearing in an apothecary. units revived by an apothecary still count as being eliminated or defeated in battle. you always revive the exact same units that were lost. so for the black death event, you would remove the units from the event card when reviving them. players who capture a city with an apothecary may use it immediately to revive units they lost in the battle.cavalry & elephants cavalry and elephants are new army units that add a die to combat, just like regular army units. any reference to army units also refers to cavalry and elephants. infantry refers specifically to the regular army units from the base game. each cavalry unit adds +1 cv to combat rolls per infantry unit in the army. each elephant unit makes your combat rolls of 1 and 2 cancel hits rather than add to your cv (even if there are no hits to cancel). rolls of 1 and 2 in excess of the number of elephants you have are added to the cv as normal. you either build cavalry and elephants from specific cities with markets or all your cities can build them due to your civilization’s special advances. the cavalry combat effect from action cards in the base game can be played as normal with any army unit. cavalry and elephants must always be taken as casualties before infantry, and in the case of barbarian attacks, also before settlers and leaders. this applies to combat rolls, effects of combat cards and event cards. if an event card allows you to select a space to remove units from, you don’t have to choose a space with cavalry or elephants over spaces with just infantry or settlers. which of the 2 types—cavalry or elephants—are removed first in a mixed army is decided by the player who receives the hits; and for barbarians by the opponent player who is rolling the barbarian’s dice. barbarian cavalry & elephants the 4 barbarian cavalry and 4 elephants have the same powers as the player versions. during the second step of the barbarians spawn icon on event cards, when you place an extra barbarian unit, you may place an available barbarian cavalry or elephant unit instead—but only if the settlement already has at least 1 barbarian infantry. pirates entering the game when you reveal a region with 2 sea spaces, place it normally, then place a pirate ship (black ship) on one of the spaces. you may permanently mark these regions with a pirate icon using the stickers. an event card with a pirate icon also spawns a pirate ship. effect pirate ships block the collection of resources from the sea spaces they are in and all adjacent sea spaces. they also block trade routes starting from, or going through, the sea spaces they are in, and all adjacent sea spaces. player ships may not pass through spaces with pirate ships, and must stop and fight them when entering their spaces. when using navigation, pirate ships only block if they occupy the only entrance to, or exit from, a group of sea spaces. if several connected sea spaces are all touching the edge, the ship using navigation can use any of them to enter or exit when moving around the edge of the board.when you explore a new region with a ship, place the region normally, then place a pirate ship if needed. you may move directly to the pirate ship’s space to battle it. if you don’t wish to fight and the pirate ship blocks you from entering the region, then you may move your ship back to the space it moved from. an event card with a pirate icon triggers a pirate raid. pirate icons when you draw an event card with a pirate icon, perform a pirate raid and then a pirate spawn/move. 1. pirate raid: for each pirate ship you can pair with a unique coastal city of yours within 2 spaces (land or sea), you must lose a resource or a mood token. each pirate ship can only be paired with 1 city and each city must be paired with a different pirate ship (similar to trade routes). for each that you are unable to pay, you must reduce the mood of a paired city if possible. myths may not be used to avoid this mood reduction. 2. pirate spawn/movement: place an unused pirate ship on any sea space that doesn’t contain a player ship. if all 4 pirate ships are in play, you may take 1 of them and place it in any sea space that doesn’t contain a player ship (or you may leave all 4 where they are). pirate ships controlled by carthage are not considered pirate ships, so they do not raid or move. attacking pirates moving your ships into a space with pirate ships starts regular naval combat. an opponent player rolls the dice for the pirate ships, but cannot play combat cards for them. for every pirate ship you defeat, you get 1 gold and 1 mood token. variants lead us instead of randomly drawing leaders at the beginning of the game, players may choose which leader they start the game with. during status phases, players may pick a new leader rather than randomly drawing one. what if? shuffle leaders together into one deck. assign 2 civilizations to each player and pick one (normal rules). then each player draws a leader from the shared leader deck as the leader they will begin with. players still only have access to 3 leaders, and they are all drawn randomly from the shared leader deck. cavalry & elephants cavalry and elephants are new army units that add a die to combat, just like regular army units. any reference to army units also refers to cavalry and elephants. infantry refers specifically to the regular army units from the base game. each cavalry unit adds +1 cv to combat rolls per infantry unit in the army. each elephant unit makes your combat rolls of 1 and 2 cancel hits rather than add to your cv (even if there are no hits to cancel). rolls of 1 and 2 in excess of the number of elephants you have are added to the cv as normal. you either build cavalry and elephants from specific cities with markets or all your cities can build them due to your civilization’s special advances. the cavalry combat effect from action cards in the base game can be played as normal with any army unit. cavalry and elephants must always be taken as casualties before infantry, and in the case of barbarian attacks, also before settlers and leaders. this applies to combat rolls, effects of combat cards and event cards. if an event card allows you to select a space to remove units from, you don’t have to choose a space with cavalry or elephants over spaces with just infantry or settlers. which of the 2 types—cavalry or elephants—are removed first in a mixed army is decided by the player who receives the hits; and for barbarians by the opponent player who is rolling the barbarian’s dice. barbarian cavalry & elephants the 4 barbarian cavalry and 4 elephants have the same powers as the player versions. during the second step of the barbarians spawn icon on event cards, when you place an extra barbarian unit, you may place an available barbarian cavalry or elephant unit instead—but only if the settlement already has at least 1 barbarian infantry. pirates entering the game when you reveal a region with 2 sea spaces, place it normally, then place a pirate ship (black ship) on one of the spaces. you may permanently mark these regions with a pirate icon using the stickers. an event card with a pirate icon also spawns a pirate ship. effect pirate ships block the collection of resources from the sea spaces they are in and all adjacent sea spaces. they also block trade routes starting from, or going through, the sea spaces they are in, and all adjacent sea spaces. player ships may not pass through spaces with pirate ships, and must stop and fight them when entering their spaces. when using navigation, pirate ships only block if they occupy the only entrance to, or exit from, a group of sea spaces. if several connected sea spaces are all touching the edge, the ship using navigation can use any of them to enter or exit when moving around the edge of the board.when you explore a new region with a ship, place the region normally, then place a pirate ship if needed. you may move directly to the pirate ship’s space to battle it. if you don’t wish to fight and the pirate ship blocks you from entering the region, then you may move your ship back to the space it moved from. an event card with a pirate icon triggers a pirate raid. pirate icons when you draw an event card with a pirate icon, perform a pirate raid and then a pirate spawn/move. 1. pirate raid: for each pirate ship you can pair with a unique coastal city of yours within 2 spaces (land or sea), you must lose a resource or a mood token. each pirate ship can only be paired with 1 city and each city must be paired with a different pirate ship (similar to trade routes). for each that you are unable to pay, you must reduce the mood of a paired city if possible. myths may not be used to avoid this mood reduction. 2. pirate spawn/movement: place an unused pirate ship on any sea space that doesn’t contain a player ship. if all 4 pirate ships are in play, you may take 1 of them and place it in any sea space that doesn’t contain a player ship (or you may leave all 4 where they are). pirate ships controlled by carthage are not considered pirate ships, so they do not raid or move. attacking pirates moving your ships into a space with pirate ships starts regular naval combat. an opponent player rolls the dice for the pirate ships, but cannot play combat cards for them. for every pirate ship you defeat, you get 1 gold and 1 mood token. variants lead us instead of randomly drawing leaders at the beginning of the game,

64,160010,CONAN,2016,MONOLITH GAMES,2.7542,118,"setup one player is the overlord and the other players are heroes. choose a scenario and follow its setup instructions. the overlord sets up the dashboard (the book of skelos), places the indicated tiles in its river, and places their equipment, spell, and item cards faceup in front of them. they place the number of red gems indicated by the scenario on the reserve zone and the fatigue zones on their dashboard. the overlord then places their models on the board, with any tokens and colored bases if necessary. each hero takes the character sheet and model of their chosen hero and places the model on the board as indicated by the scenario. each hero also takes the equipment, spell, and item cards indicated by the scenario and places them faceup near their character sheet. each hero takes the number of blue gems indicated at the bottom left corner of their character card’s reserve zone (green/left) and splits them between their reserve zone and their fatigue zone (red/middle) as specified by the scenario. finally, each hero places a red gem on the recovery chart, on the aggressive icon. the overlord places the turn track near the book of skelos and places the turn marker on 0, as well as any life point markers as indicated by the scenario. all players take note of the scenario’s special rules, create an asset deck if required, and prepare any other components. unless specified otherwise, all information in the scenario is known to the heroes and the overlord. game turn heroes perform actions in any order, coordinating and alternating among themselves until they all agree to stop and end their turn. then the overlord may activate tiles to move and attack with their units. sides alternate until one side completes their objectives. hero turn 1. start phase each hero player moves all the gems they spent during the overlord’s turn to the fatigue zone on their hero sheet. 2. stance phase each hero player chooses their stance for the next action phase. aggressive stance: place your stance marker on the . then move gems from your fatigue zone to your reserve zone: if no heroes have died, move 2 gems; if 1 hero has died, move 3 gems; and if 2 or more heroes have died, move 4 gems. an aggressive hero can perform any action during the action phase as long as they can assign gems. cautious stance: place your stance marker on the . then move gems from your fatigue zone to your reserve zone: if no heroes have died, move 5 gems; if 1 hero has died, move 6 gems; and if 2 or more heroes have died, move 7 gems. a cautious hero can perform only guard and reroll actions and cannot perform melee attack, ranged attack, manipulation, and move actions, nor drop an object or cast a spell (unless it is a reaction spell). 3. action phase heroes may perform the actions they are permitted to perform. they do not act according to a defined turn order, but instead freely coordinate each of their actions. the phase ends when heroes cannot or choose not to perform any further actions. the available actions are: melee attack choose one enemy in your area (or, if appropriate, in an adjacent area) to attack, then assign 1 or more gems from your reserve zone to your melee attack space. you may choose to attack with one of your weapon cards with a melee attack bonus. for each gem assigned, roll 1 die of the type shown on your melee attack space, plus the dice shown on the chosen card. after resolving any rerolls, add up the number of symbols on the dice to determine your attack power. if you perform a melee attack action without a weapon card, the attack is unarmed: reduce your attack power by 2. attacks made by the overlord’s units are never unarmed. you can perform the melee attack action more than once during the action phase to attack the same or different characters. however, you cannot assign gems to a space if this would raise the total number of gems on the space above its exertion limit (the red number in the space’s lower left corner). ranged attack attack with one of your weapon cards that has a ranged attack bonus. then assign 1 or more gems from your reserve zone to your ranged attack space, and choose 1 enemy in your line of sight (los) to attack. to determine los, trace an imaginary line from the in your area to the in the chosen enemy’s area. if this line crosses an obstacle on the board, the line is blocked and the target area is not in your los. otherwise, you have los to the area. the distance between areas does not affect los. you always have los to your own area. friendly or enemy models do not block los but can hinder ranged attacks. in general, only higher areas have los to lower areas; use your best judgment. when a character attacks an enemy at a lower elevation using a ranged attack, the attacker rolls an extra . for each gem assigned, roll 1 die of the type shown on your ranged attack space, plus the dice shown on the chosen card. after resolving any rerolls, add up the number of symbols on the dice to determine your attack power. if the chosen weapon has next to its ranged attack bonus, drop the weapon card in the defender’s area after the attack.you can perform the ranged attack action more than once during the action phase to attack the same or different characters. however, you cannot assign gems to a space if this would raise the total number of gems on the space above its exertion limit. guard when you are attacked, after the attack power is determined, you may defend against the attack by performing a guard action. assign 1 or more gems from your reserve zone to your guard space. you may also choose to defend with one of your equipment cards that has a guard bonus. if you defend with an equipment card, you are parrying; otherwise, you are dodging. when defending against a ranged or area attack, you can only choose a shield.for each gem assigned, roll 1 die of the type shown on your guard space, plus the dice shown on the chosen card. then determine the defense power by adding the number of symbols on the dice and your armor, if you have it. armor cards grant a minimum amount of defence that does not require the spending of energy. whether you use a guard action or not, you still benefit from the armor bonus from one of your equipment cards when calculating your defense power. you must declare whether or not you are guarding before using your armor. a guard action is only effective against a single attack unless specified otherwise. move you must spend 1 movement point (mp) to move across a border from one area to an adjacent area (hindering and some terrain effects can increase the mps required). at the start of the action phase, if you are in aggressive stance you receive mps equal to your base movement value. these are free; they do not require you to assign gems to the move action. each turn, when you stop moving to perform an action other than a move, you lose all of your remaining mps. however, you can still perform a move action to gain mps that turn: assign 1 or more gems from your reserve zone to your move space. for each gem assigned, you receive 1 mp that must be spent immediately. you cannot assign gems to a space if doing so would raise the total number of gems on the space above its exertion limit. at the end of the action phase, all unspent mps are lost. manipulation to perform a simple manipulation (pick up, give, take, or catch an object such as an item or equipment card), assign 1 gem from your reserve zone to your manipulation space (do not roll any dice). when a hero wants to give an object to another hero, one of them performs a simple manipulation, and that object is immediately equipped by the hero who takes it. to perform a complex manipulation, assign 1 or more gems from your reserve zone to your manipulation space and choose one of your equipment cards with a manipulation bonus. for each gem assigned, roll 1 die of the type shown on your manipulation space, plus the dice shown on the chosen card. determine the manipulation power by adding up the number of symbols on the dice. if the manipulation power is equal to or higher than the manipulation’s difficulty, you succeed at the manipulation. complex manipulations have a difficulty defined by the scenario. you can perform the manipulation action more than once during the action phase. however, you cannot assign gems to a space if this would raise the total number of gems on the space above its exertion limit. throwing and catching an object to throw an object, choose one of your objects that has an encumbrance value of 3 or less, and an area in your los. then perform a complex manipulation with a difficulty equal to the distance from you to the chosen area. if you succeed, you drop the object in the chosen area. if you fail, you drop the object a number of areas away equal to the manipulation power, following the los to the chosen area. when the object is dropped in an area, 1 hero in that area may immediately perform a simple manipulation to catch the object or pick it up. dropping an object you can drop one of your objects in your area as a free action (without assigning gems). if an object with an area effect is dropped, resolve the effect as if it had been thrown.opening a chest to open a chest, pick the lock by performing a complex manipulation with a difficulty of 2 (unless the scenario specifies otherwise) in same area as the chest. if you succeed, remove the chest from the board and place the top card of the asset deck next to your hero sheet. when you open a chest, you can choose not to claim its content. place the top card of the asset deck in the same area as the chest; it can be picked up later by performing a simple manipulation. reroll you can perform reroll actions after rolling dice but before finalizing the roll results. assign 1 or more gems from your reserve zone to your reroll space. then reroll that many dice. you can perform the reroll action multiple times and may reroll the same dice or different dice each time. casting a spell place your spell cards faceup near your hero sheet. to cast a spell, assign gems equal to the spell’s cost from your reserve zone to that card. the number of gems placed cannot exceed the spell’s exertion limit. in the end phase, each player moves all gems from their spell cards to their fatigue zone. some spells function as attacks: determine the attack power by adding up the number of symbols on the dice. characters defend against, and suffer damage from, spell attacks as they would against other attacks. 4. end phase once all heroes have finished performing actions, each hero moves all gems from their action spaces, ally tiles, spell cards to their fatigue zone. then proceed to the overlord’s turn. overlord turn 1. recovery phase the overlord moves all the gems they spent during the heroes’ turn to their fatigue (red/middle) zone. then they move a number of gems from their fatigue zone to their reserve (green/left) zone equal to their recovery value (on the recovery value tile specified by the scenario). 2. advance turn marker the overlord advances the turn marker 1 space on the turn track. 3. activation phase the overlord can activate 0, 1 or 2 tiles in the river. to activate a tile, move a number of gems from your reserve zone to your fatigue zone equal to the tile’s activation cost (on the token above the tile). then remove the activated tile from the river, sliding the remaining tiles to the left, and place the tile at the end of the river. you can also activate a dead unit tile. if the activated tile is a unit, activate all units in the group, spending any number of their mps to move them. each unit can perform 1 attack during its activation. when a unit attacks, all units in that group lose their remaining mps. you can activate the same tile twice, but the second time you must move gems equal to the tile’s new activation cost. a unit tile may correspond to a single character or a group of minions. unless specified otherwise in the scenario, the number of characters corresponding to a tile cannot exceed the number indicated at the start of the scenario. a single character may also be represented by more than 1 unit tile. if the activated tile is an event tile, resolve events as described by the scenario.4. end phase the overlord moves all gems spent during their turn (including those placed on spell cards) to their fatigue zone. hindering a character may be affected by hindering when moving, making a ranged attack, or performing a complex manipulation in an area where the total number of enemy characters is equal to or higher than the total number of friendly characters. these actions are affected by hindering: movement, ranged attacks, and complex manipulations. these actions are not affected by hindering: melee attacks, guard, rerolls, spell casting, and simple manipulations. movement: to move out of an area, you must spend 1 extra mp for every enemy character that isn’t ‘cancelled out’ by the presence of another friendly character in the area. movement of overlord characters is also affected by hindering. dice rolling: when rolling dice for an action affected by hindering, ignore 1 symbol on the dice for every enemy character that isn’t ‘cancelled out’ by the presence of another friendly character in the area. rerolls once, after you roll a die indicated by a reroll icon, you may reroll 1 die of the matching type for free (without performing a reroll action). certain skills allow players to reroll a die for free even if that die has already been rerolled. skills and encumbrance the icon to the left of a hero’s skills is that hero’s maximum encumbrance value. if your encumbrance level ever exceeds your maximum encumbrance value, you must immediately drop 1 or more objects to reduce your encumbrance level to equal to or less than your maximum encumbrance value. the red number in the lower-right corner of each skill icon is the skill’s encumbrance limit. the total of the encumbrance values of all of your objects is your encumbrance level. if your encumbrance level is equal to or higher than a skill’s encumbrance limit, the skill cannot be used. encumbrance also affects movement. the icon to the right of your skills is your movement and has 2 encumbrance limits. during the action phase, if your encumbrance value is equal to or higher than either encumbrance limit, you receive fewer mps from your movement value based on the highest exceeded limit (as indicated under the limit). one-handed and two-handed weapons a weapon with an encumbrance value of 2 or less is a one- handed weapon. a weapon with an encumbrance value of 3 or more is a two- handed weapon (a character with such a weapon cannot use another weapon for a single attack). hero damage each time a hero suffers damage, move that many gems from their fatigue zone to their wound zone. if there is still more damage to suffer, move gems from their action spaces, spell cards, and ally tiles. if there is still more, remove gems from their reserve zone. when all of a hero’s gems are in their wound zone, that hero dies. drop their weapon and item cards in their area on the board and remove their model from the board.falling damage when a hero falls, roll dice as instructed by the scenario. you cannot defend against falling (the guard action, and armor, do not prevent the damage), but can perform reroll actions to reroll the dice. falling does not cause you to lose any remaining base mps. if a falling character is carrying another character, both suffer the same damage but the player controlling the carrying character is the only one who can perform reroll actions. area attacks indicates that an effect is an area attack. a character attacking an area attacks each character in that area. the dice for an area attack are rolled once and apply to each attack. the attacker resolves the attacks in the order of their choice. guard bonuses from weapon cards cannot be used to defend against area attacks, but dodging, armor, and guard bonuses from shields work as usual. assets with the area attack icon are discarded after use. occupied areas a character cannot end its movement or move across an area if the model’s base could not fit entirely in that area; that area is an occupied area. occupied areas are considered to be within melee range of all adjacent areas. however, it is not possible to perform a melee attack from an occupied area to an adjacent area. activating allies a hero with the leadership skill can give orders to any ally on the battlefield unless specified otherwise in the scenario. when instructed, place the corresponding ally tile next to the sheet of the hero with the leadership skill. during the action phase, if they are in an aggressive stance, the hero may activate the ally’s models by assigning gems from their reserve zone to the ally tile: – assigning 1 gem activates an ally model. each ally model can only be activated once per action phase. an ally loses its remaining points from its base movement value when it attacks. – the hero can assign additional gems to gain additional mps (1 gem = 1 mp for 1 ally model) after they spent their base movement or after they attacked. a hero cannot gain more mps than the ally’s base movement value. an aggressive or cautious hero can also perform a guard action with an ally by assigning gems. for each gem assigned, the hero rolls . an aggressive or cautious hero may reroll an ally’s dice by assigning 1 gem per rerolled die. unless specified otherwise, an ally has only 1 life point (lp). at the end of the action phase, gems on ally tiles are moved to the hero’s fatigue zone. if all the heroes with the leadership skill die, allies are immediately removed from the game. overlord tile attributes armor the amount of damage automatically absorbed by the unit’s armor each time a unit represented by that unit tile is attacked. subtract the unit’s armor value from the attack power to determine the amount of damage suffered by that unit for each attack against that unit. base movement the number of free mps available to each unit represented by the unit tile. these points can be spent only before any unit from the same unit tile attacks. when a unit attacks, all units in that group lose their remaining mps. extra mps can be gained by using the movement benefit. melee attack the number and type of dice that each unit represented by the unit tile rolls when performing a melee attack. the results of these dice may be rerolled, but their number and type cannot be changed. ranged attack the number and type of dice that each unit represented by the unit tile rolls when performing a ranged attack. the results of these dice may be rerolled, but their number and type cannot be changed. skills skills are represented by icons. event tiles when an event tile is activated, the overlord must perform one of the events described by the scenario. sometimes the event tile is used to resolve more than one event each time it is activated. overlord benefits the overlord can use benefits to temporarily improve a single unit. movement after spending the points from a unit’s base movement, you may use the movement benefit to gain extra mps. assign 1 or more gems from your reserve zone to the movement benefit space. each gem assigned grants 1 extra mp to a single unit from the activated unit tile. a unit can gain at most a number of extra mps equal to its base movement value during each activation. you can use this benefit before or after an attack. this is the only way for a unit to move after attacking. the movement benefit can be used only during the overlord’s turn. guard use to defend against an attack. assign 1 or more gems from your reserve zone to the guard benefit space. roll for each gem assigned, then determine the defense power by adding the number of symbols on the dice to the unit’s armor value. only 1 guard action can be performed per attack. you must choose the number of gems to assign before rolling the dice, after which you can no longer add dice. reroll use to reroll dice before the results of the roll are determined. assign 1 or more gems from your reserve zone to the reroll benefit space. for each gem assigned, you may reroll 1 die of your choice. you can use this benefit at any time, including during the heroes’ turn. life points and dead unit tiles minions have only 1 lp. lieutenants and monsters have several lps, represented by a life point marker placed on the turn track. when a unit reaches 0 lps, it is dead and its model is removed from the board. when all units from the same unit tile are dead, that unit tile is considered dead. the overlord removes that unit tile from the river, slides the remaining tiles to the left, places the dead unit tile at the end of the river, and flips it to its bloodied side. the dead unit tile continues moving normally in the river. if one or more characters from that dead unit tile return as reinforcements, that tile is immediately flipped faceup and remains in its current position in the river. the overlord may activate a dead unit tile; this still counts as one of the 2 tiles the overlord can activate during their activation phase. in this case, the overlord does not activate any models and simply moves the unit tile to the end of the river. dredging the river at any time during their turn, the overlord may dredge the river by removing 1 or more dead unit tiles from the game. to do so, the overlord must permanently return 2 gems from their fatigue zone to the game box. if there are not enough gems in their fatigue zone, the overlord can return gems from their benefit zones or spell cards. if those are also empty, the overlord can return gems from their reserve zone. the dead unit tile is then permanently removed from the river and returned to the game box, and the remaining tiles are slid to the left. dredging the river does not count as an activation and there is no limit to the number of tiles that can be removed from the book of skelos, as long as the overlord can and wants to pay for them. units from a removed dead unit tile can no longer return to play (including as reinforcements). reinforcement cost this is the number of reinforcement points the overlord must spend to return 1 model represented by that unit tile to the board. if a unit tile does not have a reinforcement cost, it cannot be reinforced. during the game, the overlord gains reinforcement points by activating the event tile. they may then immediately spend these points to return models to the board. reinforcements are placed in any of the reinforcement areas (indicated by reinforcement tokens). if a reinforcement area is occupied, the overlord can choose to place the reinforced models in an adjacent area. if the adjacent area is also occupied, reinforced models cannot be placed in this area. unless specified otherwise, the overlord can spend reinforcement points only to return to the board models that have been killed during the scenario. if one or more models from a dead unit tile are returned to the board as reinforcement(s), the unit tile is flipped faceup and remains in its current position in the river. overlord unit spell casting to cast a spell, the overlord must first activate the unit tile of the unit with the spellcaster skill who has that spell. the overlord can then cast the spell in addition to moving and attacking with that character. a spell’s cost can be fixed or variable depending on the spell. when the spell is cast, the overlord assigns a number of gems from their reserve zone to the spell card equal to the spell’s cost and resolves the spell’s effects as described on the card. the icon on a spell card indicates that the spell is a reaction spell that can be cast anytime. when casting a reaction spell during the heroes’ turn, it is not necessary to activate the spellcaster’s unit tile. the overlord cannot assign gems to a spell card if doing so would raise the total number of gems on the card above its exertion limit."

talents taken. move land units player may move his land units from a single province with a general or caesar in it. units must may move any number of contiguous provinces, but must stop when entering a province occupied by a non-allied military unit. units may move between provinces connected by arrows as long as there are no non-allied galleys in the sea zone where the arrows are located. units beginning in the same province may move to different destination provinces. amphibious movement units may be moved from a province adjacent to a sea zone to any other province adjacent to a sea zone with his galley(s) in it. no more than 4 military units (and any number of generals/caesar) per galley adjacent to the destination province may be moved. units may not be moved before embarking. land

training cards each die that matches a unit type in the battle army results in one hit on the opponent’s army. hits are limited by the number of units of that type in your army. for each hit, the opponent removes one unit of his choice. generals/caesars cannot be eliminated. rolls and losses are considered simultaneous, unless the defender is defending a city, in which case he rolls first and the attacker’s losses are determined before the attack. retreat following each round and beginning with the defender, players may retreat all of his units to a single adjacent province with no non-allied military units (not counting generals/caesar) in it. if all military units are lost, generals/caesar must retreat, and may retreat to any adjacent province. chaos the loser of the battle

player may use a senate vote card once each campaign season. this does not count as an action but must be done during the player’s normal turn. multiple senate votes from different cards may be called by a single player during his turn. the player says “i am calling a senate vote on ...” whatever the card states. he then begins the vote by displaying one or more senator cards (or he may pass). clockwise, following players raise the vote or pass. the vote ends when all players have passed. the highest bid wins the vote, pays in senator cards (cards must equal the bid—they are removed from play) and receives the benefit on the senate card immediately. players who did not win reclaim their senator cards. the player with the most influence in italia gains one random senator card out of the cards paid by the winner. ending the game at the end of 4 campaign seasons the player with the most victory points wins. in a tie, the tied player with the most influence tokens wins."
69,40531,COSMIC ENCOUNTER,2008,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,2.3034,89,"setup place the warp in the center of the play area. each player chooses a player color and takes the 5 planets of that color, then places their colony marker next to the warp by the space marked 0. each player takes the 20 ships of his color and places 4 of them on each of his planets in a stack. remove any cards from the destiny deck that refer to player colors not being used, then shuffle the deck. shuffle the flare cards and deal 2 to each player. each player takes the alien sheets corresponding to the flares and secretly chooses one of the aliens to play. the chosen alien sheet is placed facedown in front of the player, and other is returned to the box. aliens are rated by player skill level: beginners: green alerts; moderately experienced: yellow; experts: red. the dealt flares are then added to the cosmic deck which is then shuffled. if there are fewer than 5 players, extra flares are randomly added to bring the total to 10 flares (only use one version of the filch card). each player is dealt a hand of 8 cards from the cosmic deck, and the deck placed facedown. players may look at their cards, but may not show them to other players. draw from the destiny deck until a player color is drawn. that player becomes the first player. shuffle the drawn card back into the destiny deck. game turn the first player starts, then play continues clockwise. a player’s turn consists of 1 or 2 encounters: the first encounter is guaranteed, but the player has a second encounter only if he wins the first encounter (or successfully makes a deal). the active player is called the offense and the player he encounters is called the defense. the offense first checks his hand to make sure it contains at least one encounter card. if it does not, he reveals any remaining cards, discards them, then draws a new hand of 8 cards. should the offense run out of encounter cards later on, his turn ends. each encounter is comprised of 7 phases: 1. regroup one of the offense’s ships is retrieved from the warp and placed in one of his colonies. if he has no colonies, the retrieved ship is placed directly in the hyperspace gate.2. destiny the offense draws the top card of the destiny deck. if there is only one card left in the deck, do not draw it; instead shuffle the final card and the discard pile together to form a new deck, and then draw. if a color is drawn if the card shows a player color, it indicates the planet system where the offense must have an encounter (and therefore which player is the defense). if a player draws his own color, he may either draw again (until he draws a card of a different color) or attempt to drive a foreign colony off one of his home planets. the player whose owns the colony becomes the defense. when drawing his own color, if a player has a home planet with no ships on it at all, then he may aim the gate at that planet to automatically re-establish a colony there with up to 4 ships from other colonies. this counts as a successful encounter. if a wild is drawn if the card is a wild, the offense may have an encounter with any player. the chosen player is the defense and the encounter must take place in the chosen player’s home system. if a special is drawn if the card is a special, the defense for the encounter and where the encounter takes place is indicated. specials are treated as though the card showed the color of the player designated as the defense. 3. launch the offense takes the hyperspace gate and points it at a planet in the system indicated by the destiny card. he then takes 1 to 4 ships from any of his colonies (home or foreign), stacks them, and places them on the wide end of the gate. the defense may not add or subtract ships from the targeted planet. 4. alliance first, the offense announces which players he wishes to have as allies (he may not invite the defense). these players should not respond yet. next, the defense invites allies, even those already invited by the offense (he may not invite the offense). the other players then choose sides. starting with the player to the left of the offense and continuing clockwise, each player accepts or declines invitations. a player may only ally with either the offense or the defense side, or neither side. only after a player has allied or declined, and committed ships, does the next player accept or decline an invitation. if a player allies with the offense (offensive ally), he places 1 to 4 of his ships on the gate. if a player allies with the defense (defensive ally), he places 1 to 4 of his ships next to the targeted planet. allied ships can be taken from any colonies.5. planning the offense and the defense now each select an encounter card from their hand (attack, negotiate, or morph) and place it facedown in front of themselves. if the defense has no encounter cards, he may reveal any remaining cards, discard them, and then draw a new hand of 8 cards before selecting a card. if the offense has no encounter cards, his turn ends immediately. 6. reveal the offense and defense simultaneously turn their cards faceup. if both players reveal attack cards the offense adds his card value to the number of his ships, plus any allied ships, on the gate. the defense adds his card value to the number of his ships on the planet plus any allied ships next to it. the player with the higher total wins (ties go to the defense). if one player reveals an attack card and the other reveals a negotiate card the player who played the negotiate card automatically loses the encounter. he will get to claim compensation. if both players reveal negotiate cards all allies on both sides return their ships to any of their colonies and get nothing. the main players have one minute to make a deal. a player may trade cards and/or allow his opponent to establish one colony on any one planet where he already has a colony. any of a player’s ships that are not in the warp can be used to establish this colony. cards must come from the players’ hands, not from the deck. any ships remaining in the gate after the deal return to any of the offense’s colonies. allies are never included in a deal. the players cannot agree to do nothing; a card or a base must change hands for a deal to be successful. if no agreement is reached within one minute, the deal fails and each player sends 3 of their ships to the warp. if either player reveals the morph card the morph card becomes an exact duplicate of the opponent’s encounter card. resolve the encounter normally as though both sides played the duplicated card. once the encounter is resolved, the morph card returns to normal. 7. resolution if the offense won all the ships on the gate are placed on the planet. each player establishing a colony advances his player colony marker by 1 space around the warp. the defense’s ships on the planet plus any defensive allies’ ships go to the warp. other ships on the planet do not go to the warp. if the defense won ships in already established colonies on the defending planet stay there. all the ships on the gate go to the warp. defensive allies return their allying ships to any of their colonies. they also receive rewards: for each ship they contributed to the defense, that player must draw a card from the deck or take 1 of his ships from the warp and place it on any of the player’s colonies. if a deal was made the terms of the deal are carried out. if a deal failed the main players (offense and defense) each lose 3 of their ships of their choice to the warp. compensation when one player plays a negotiate and his opponent plays an attack card, the player who played the negotiate card gets to collect compensation. he must randomly take one card for each ship he lost to the warp (not counting any allies’ ships) from his opponent’s hand. if the opponent doesn’t have enough cards to provide full compensation, take his entire hand of cards. after resolving the encounter discard the revealed encounter cards to the discard pile. if the offense won the encounter (or successfully made a deal) and this was his first encounter, he may have a second encounter. if the defense won (or a deal failed), the offense may not have a second encounter; play passes clockwise. winning the game the winner is the first player to have 5 colonies on any planets outside his home system. if more than one player gains 5 colonies at the same time, the players share a win. powers losing alien powers when 3 or more of a player’s home colonies are eliminated, the player immediately loses his alien power and turns his alien sheet facedown. if he draws his own color from the destiny deck (or a special card designating him as the defense), he may attempt to re-establish a colony in his home system. if the player regains his power by having a colony on at least 3 home planets, turn his alien sheet faceup again. zapping powers if a power is zapped, the effect of that power’s use is canceled and that power may not be used again until the end of the current encounter. the word use in bold italics on an alien sheet indicates when a power may be canceled with a zap. some parts of some alien powers do not require the power to be used in order to occur, and therefore cannot be zapped.timing conflicts the timing strip along the bottom of each alien sheet and all non-encounter cards generally states when the game effect may be used. if there is still a timing conflict, resolution takes place in the following order: 1. the offense. 2. the defense. 3. players who are not the main players, starting with the player to the left of the offense and proceeding clockwise. colonies a colony is one or more ships of the same color on a planet. a player may only have one colony on any given planet, but a planet may have multiple colonies belonging to different players. a colony that a player owns in his home system is a home colony. a colony that a player owns in any other player’s home system is called a foreign colony. driving out foreign colonies if a player draws his own color from the destiny deck (or a special card that designates him as the defense), he may try to eliminate a foreign colony in his home system. the offense points the gate at another player’s colony in his own planet system and chooses which player’s colony is the target, who becomes the defense for that encounter. all ships of one color on any planet make up only one colony. all other colonies on the planet are bystanders. if there is a planet in a player’s home system with no ships on it, aiming the gate at that planet allows the player to automatically reestablish a colony on that planet with up to 4 ships from any of his colonies. this counts as a successful encounter. home planets without colonies if a player has no colony on a home planet that he is defending, the player defends the planet normally except that his ship count is 0. stripping a planet of ships as soon as a player removes the last of his ships from any planet, he no longer has a colony there. any ships involved in the encounter, or ships retrieved from the warp, cannot return to that planet. if a player has no ships left on one of his home planets, he or she must still defend it (with 0 ships). if a player must relocate ships but has no colonies anywhere on the board, those ships go to the warp. cards the different card types are: attack, negotiate, morph, reinforcement, flare, and artifact. drawing new cards if the offense has no encounter cards (attacks, negotiates, or morphs) at the start of his turn, he must play (if possible) or discard any non-encounter cards, draw 8 new cards, and continue.if the offense runs out of encounter cards later during his turn and needs to play one, his turn ends immediately. he and his allies then return their ships on the gate to their colonies. if the defense has no encounter cards when he is required to play a card in an encounter, he must play (if possible) or discard any non-encounter cards, draw 8 new cards, and play one of them in the encounter. if he doesn’t draw any encounter cards, this process is repeated as many times as necessary. artifact cards artifacts cards cannot be played as encounter cards but may be played at other times. they are discarded after use. reinforcement cards reinforcements cannot be played as encounter cards. instead, during the reveal phase, after encounter cards are revealed, the offense, defense, and any allies may play reinforcement cards on either side of the encounter. the reinforcement card adds to that side’s total. players may continue playing reinforcements in response to other reinforcements until all players pass. once all players have passed, the encounter is resolved with the new totals. flare cards flares cannot be played as encounter cards, but may be played at other times. flares are returned to the player’s hand after being played, but cannot be used more than once per encounter, and no more than one flare may be used per encounter. normally the wild flare effect on the card is used. however, if a player plays his alien’s own flare, the super flare effect on the card must be used. when a player loses his power or has it zapped, he no longer has access to the super flare effect of his alien, and may only use the wild flare effect on his flare until he or she regains access to the alien power. variant summary four planets: each player receives only 4 planets and 16 ships; only 4 colonies are required to win, and players only need 2 home colonies to use their alien power. hidden powers: players leave their alien sheets facedown (and cannot use their power); a player may turn his sheet faceup at any time in order to use their power from then on. rotating powers: the offense draws a new alien sheet at the start of his turn, and may then choose to keep it or the old sheet, discarding the other. if hidden powers are being used, new powers enter play facedown. freewheeling flares: players may use as many flares as they wish during each encounter, although each may still only be used once per encounter.

remove their figure from the board. if the elder one is on the board, it can only be attacked once the ritual is disrupted. rest (only on a safe space) if you are in a safe space, you may heal your stress and/ or health up to 3 spaces in total (in any combination). you may perform the rest action more than once per turn. sanity cannot be healed by resting. trade you and all investigators in your space may trade any number of items or companions with each other (giving or receiving). some discovery cards have items or companions on both left and right sides of the card, but a traded card must remain on the same side as it was originally. you may not trade conditions. episode actions each episode has 2 unique actions on the episode card. these work just like the standard actions. 2. draw mythos card draw the top mythos card from the deck and resolve it, then place it on a faceup discard pile. the recurring trauma insanity has an investigator keep a previously drawn mythos card in front of them. mythos cards may have several different steps to them, divided into 3 types. you must perform these steps in order, from top to bottom, before discarding the card. if you can’t perform a step on the card, skip it and move on to the next. elder one summoning this symbol has no effect when the card is drawn, but may cause the elder one to advance on its track at the end of the turn. if the card has this symbol, make sure it remains visible when it is discarded. special effects unless otherwise stated, these effects only affect the player whose turn it is, ignoring all other investigators. any choice that needs to be made is up to the active player. when an effect moves an enemy towards a space, count how many spaces the enemy would move in all possible paths, and choose the shortest one. on a tie, the active player chooses. the enemy must always be moved as much as allowed towards its target, but stops when it reaches its target. summon enemies some cards indicate a gate color and the specific enemy that must be summoned there. if you have the corresponding figure available in reserve, place it on the indicated space. otherwise, ignore this step. if there are multiple gates and enemies indicated, perform the summonings in order. skip any remaining gates if you are out of figures.3. investigate or fight if you are in a safe space, you must investigate your space: draw the top card of the discovery deck and read the text in the center box aloud. if the deck is depleted you cannot investigate anymore. if you must choose an option, you cannot one that requires you to take stress if you don’t have the required amount of stress to take. claiming a companion, item, or condition means you slide the card under your investigator board on the appropriate side. there is no limit to the number of cards you can have. using a discovery card does not require an action. if it’s not specified when you may use one, it may be used anytime during your turn; however they can never be used while resolving another card, effect, or during a roll. any wounds you take may be applied to companions you currently have instead. this still counts as you taking wounds for card effects. companions can never be healed. if their wounds equal the number on their card, they are discarded and any benefit they give you is immediately lost. companions may also give you a level in a skill. if you don’t have that skill, you gain level 1 in that skill while you have this companion with you (take the corresponding token). if you already have the skill, move the skill level marker 1 level forward. if you lose the companion, move the marker back 1 level. if you are not in a safe space, the enemies fight you: do not draw a discovery card. instead, each enemy in your space attacks you in the order you choose (they ignore other investigators), until all enemies in your space that could attack you have done so. if an effect makes you enter a space of an enemy, or an enemy enters your space during this phase, that enemy attacks you even if it was not in your space at the beginning of this phase. if an enemy that was in your space leaves your space, it doesn’t attack you anymore. defending against enemies when an enemy attacks you, roll the number and type of dice as shown on their reference card. each success gives you 1 wound. each tentacle costs you 1 sanity. elder sign symbols only have an effect if the enemy has the ability to use them. you may use stress to reroll these dice and you may use any of your skills to help avoid or minimize the attack. 4. resolve end of turn 1. end of turn effects any effects that happen at the end of turn, except for elder one effects, happen now, in any order the active player chooses. 2. fire! at the end of your turn, roll 1 standard die for every fire token on your investigator board. you may use stress to reroll dice. take 1 wound for each success and lose 1 sanity for each tentacle. then discard all fire tokens on your investigator board. enemies don’t catch fire when leaving a space with fire tokens. if you need to add a fire token to the board but there are none left, ignore the effect. if you need to add one to your investigator board but there are none left, use a wound token instead. 3. check the mythos discard pile if there are 3 cards in the discard pile that have the elder one summoning symbol: advance the elder one along the summoning track. if it is already on the board, move the progression token along the track instead. the revealed elder one stage cards and the episode card will tell you what to do when the elder one advances. resolve the elder one effects first. it doesn’t matter whether it’s the elder one figure or the progression token advancing on the summoning track, the effects are resolved in the same way. after the elder one advances, shuffle all of the discarded mythos cards back into the deck. 4. check the elder one summoning the elder one is summoned if: • the elder one entered the first red space on the track; or • the ritual was disrupted this turn. when the elder one is summoned, move the stage 1 card to the side, revealing the stage 2 card underneath. resolve its reveal effects, which specify where the elder one must be summoned. effects and dice from previous stages remain in play until the end of the game. place the progression token on the summoning track on the space previously occupied by the elder one figure. use this to mark the elder one’s progress until the end of the game. 5. elder one end of turn effects as the elder one progresses through its stages, there may be end of turn effects visible on its stage cards. resolve all effects on each stage card in the order of the stages: first 1, then 2, then 3, and then final. any effect that refers to you is referring solely to the investigator whose turn it is. the turn is now over, and the player to the left takes their turn. dice and checks when investigators make a roll, you always roll 3 standard black dice (and may also be allowed to add bonus green dice). enemies roll a specific number and type of dice for their attacks, as indicated on their reference card. each die has 4 different possible results: success: you (or the enemy) succeeded at your attempt (or partially succeeded). if you were attacking, it means you hit. if an enemy is attacking, it means they hit you. in some cases, you need to reach a target amount of successes in a single roll. elder sign: these mean nothing unless you have a skill or card that uses them. tentacle: for each tentacle, you lose 1 sanity, moving your tracker 1 space to the right. tentacles on every roll cost you sanity, whether you’re attacking, being attacked, or just ‘making a roll’. blank: no effect most of the time. bonus dice skills and cards may give you bonus green dice, as noted on their description. some checks may also give you bonus dice if you have a related ability. finally, reaching certain insanity thresholds will add permanent bonus dice to all your rolls. there is no limit to the number of bonus dice that may be added to a roll (if you run out of dice, note the results and roll the same dice again). rerolls after rolling dice, you may take 1 stress to reroll 1 die, ignoring its original result. you may do this as often as you like on any roll you make, until your stress is at the maximum. when enemies attack you, you roll for them and may also take stress to reroll their dice.applying results once you’re done using any rerolls, tally the number of each result obtained (note that some die faces contain 2 results). make sure to apply any symbol changes from abilities (such as counting as successes). then apply the results of the dice roll in this order: 1. use any successes: if an investigator is attacking, these successes are wounds applied to their target. if an enemy is attacking, successes are also wounds applied to their target (usually an investigator). if you were told to ‘make a roll’ by an action, you must match or exceed the number of successes indicated on the card to be successful. 2. resolve effects: resolve any effects that may be tied to the result of the roll. 3. apply any tentacles: lose 1 sanity for each tentacle rolled (move your marker 1 space to the right on your sanity track). if you reach a space on your sanity track, stop moving the marker (even if you didn’t lose the full amount of sanity), activate your insanity, and level up a skill. sanity whenever you lose sanity, the marker on your sanity track advances to the right. if it reaches the skull at the end, you are consumed by madness and eliminated. the track has insanity threshold spaces that activate your insanity and level up a skill, and sometimes give you permanent bonus dice. when you lose more sanity (from dice rolls, discovery, or mythos cards) than required to hit the next , the marker stops at the ; ignore excess sanity loss. gaining bonus dice some spaces display a green bonus die under them. once each of these is reached, the investigator adds +1 bonus die to all rolls they make for the rest of the game. activating insanities every time an investigator's marker reaches a , their insanity card activates. perform the symptoms on the card. if multiple investigators reach a at the same time, they activate clockwise from the current player. leveling up skills when the marker reaches a , after activating their insanity, the investigator levels up 1 of their skills. choose 1 skill and move its marker 1 space to the right. some skills replace a lower level skill as you level up, while others add to them (as described on the skill). death of an investigator if the marker ever reaches the skull at the end of your wound track, you are dead. when an investigator is killed or consumed by madness, the game is immediately lost if the elder one is still on the summoning track. if the elder one has already been summoned to the board, the other investigators may continue playing and try to win the game. first, discard all discovery cards and tokens that investigator had. the episode may specify something to do with any special tokens the investigator had been holding.if the investigator died during their turn, skip all the following turn phases except for the check the mythos discard pile phase. if there are 3 elder one summoning symbols, the elder one advances and its effects are applied (if it is needed to determine the position of the dead investigator, use the space where they died). from now on, that player’s turn is skipped entirely. disrupting the ritual each episode describes the tasks the investigators must accomplish in order to disrupt the cultists’ ritual and make the elder one mortal, even if only for a short time. the elder one cannot be attacked or damaged until the ritual is disrupted (though it can attack you if it’s on the board). if the investigators disrupt the ritual, the elder one is summoned at the end of the turn. fighting the elder one once the elder one is summoned to the board, it acts like any enemy, attacking investigators that end their turn in its space. the number and type of dice the elder one rolls is the total of all dice displayed on all its revealed stage cards. until the ritual is disrupted, the elder one cannot be attacked or damaged, even if it’s already been summoned to the board by reaching the red space on the summoning track. after the ritual is disrupted, the elder one can be attacked and damaged like any other enemy. the elder one has multiple stages, with individual healths, which must be defeated one at a time until it’s ultimately destroyed. starting with stage 2, each card displays: • a one-time effect that takes place when that card is revealed. • an ongoing effect that remains in play until the end of the game. • health showing how many wounds that stage can take. • the number and type of dice that stage adds to the elder one’s attacks. when a stage has wounds equal to or greater than its health, that stage is defeated. move that stage card to the side to reveal the next and resolve its when revealed effect. any excess wounds do not carry over to the next stage. all of the previous stages’ effects and dice remain in play until the end of the game. ending the game you all win the game when you kill the elder one by defeating its final stage. if multiple end-game triggers happen at the same time, winning conditions have precedence. you all lose the game when one of the following happens: • an investigator is killed or consumed by madness before the elder one is summoned to the board (stage 1 card). • all investigators are killed or consumed by madness after the elder one is summoned (stages 2 onward). • the progression token reaches the last (8th) space of the summoning track."
72,139976,CTHULHU WARS,2014,PETERSEN GAMES,3.1364,264,"setup 2 and 3 players: use the 3 player sides of the boards. 4 players: use one 3 player side, and one 5 player side (initially, make the eastern hemisphere the 5 player side). 5 players (expansion required): use both 5 player sides. place the dice and gates within reach of the players. place the doom track, and the ritual of annihilation track matching the number of players, at one end of the board. place the ritual of annihilation marker on the lowest number (5) on the track. turn all the elder sign trophy tokens facedown (elder sign faceup) and mix them up (or put them in a bag). each player chooses or randomly selects a faction and takes their faction card, 6 spellbooks, and figures (the yellow sign faction also takes the desecration markers). place each player’s doom marker on the 0 space of the doom track and their power marker on the 8 space of the power track on their faction card. set up a pool near your faction card for spellbooks, figures, and markers. you can never have more figures in play than those in your pool. check your faction sheet to find your start area (marked on the board with your faction’s glyph) and place a gate and 6 acolyte cultists there. put one of the cultists on the gate: a gate is controlled when it has a cultist on it. for the first turn, cthulhu is the first player and takes the first player token. if cthulhu is not in the game, choose a first player. the windwalker faction may never be the first player at the start of the game. phases of play 1. action phase starting with the first player and proceeding in order of play, each player takes 1 action. continue to take actions in order until all players are out of power and cannot take any more. there are 4 types of actions: common, unique, spellbook requirement, and unlimited. all actions have a power cost (sometimes 0): lower your power marker on your power track the appropriate amount and then perform the action. you cannot decline to take an action if you still have power. if you have power but do not wish to complete an action, you may voluntarily drop all your power to 0. if you have 0 power when it is your turn, you are skipped (you cannot perform actions which cost 0 power). however, if you are at 0 power and an ability or spellbook provides you with power, you can take an action as normal. common actions common actions are available to all factions. recruit cultist: 1 power (requires a unit) place a cultist from your pool onto the map. you must have a unit (of any type) in the area where you recruit a cultist. however, if you have no units on the map, you do not need a unit in an area where the cultist is recruited. you may only recruit 1 cultist per use of this action.summon monster: varies (requires a controlled gate) place a monster from your pool onto the map. you must control a gate in the area where you summon the monster and pay the monster’s cost as shown on your faction card. you may only summon 1 monster per use of this action. awaken great old one: varies (requirements apply) bring your great old one into play. every goo is unique, with its own series of steps to follow to awaken it. you may only awaken 1 goo per use of this action. create gate: 3 power (requires cultist) pay 3 power and place a gate in an area. you must have a cultist there and no gate (only one gate can exist per area). immediately place the cultist atop the gate to indicate you now control it (a use of the unlimited control gate action). you can only create 1 gate per use of this action. move: 1 power per unit moved for each power you spend, you may move 1 unit from its current area into an adjacent area. you may move as many units as you want per move action, but you cannot move a unit more than once per action. you can move units from different areas into the same area, or into different areas, or from the same area into different areas, or any combination. battle: 1 power (requires unit with at least 1 combat) choose any area in which both you and an enemy faction have at least 1 unit. you must have at least 1 combat in order to declare a battle, but you may declare a battle on an enemy who has 0 combat. if more than 1 enemy faction has forces present, you must fight only one (only 2 factions fight at a time). moving into an area containing enemy units does not trigger a battle; units can co-exist in an area without battling. you may only battle once, in 1 area, per use of this action. capture cultist: 1 power if you have a monster or goo in an area, and an enemy has cultists, but no monsters or goos, you may capture an enemy cultist and place it on your faction card. your opponent chooses which cultist is captured if he has more than one in the area. to protect against capture, you need a protector of your own in the area. goos outrank monsters, and monsters outrank cultists. your goo protects against all potential captors; your monster or goo protects against a monster captor; and cultists cannot capture cultists. your monster or goo never protects another faction’s cultist from capture by a third party. capture is not battle, and battle abilities do not apply. you may only capture 1 cultist per use of this action. unique actions actions unique to a particular faction, usually tied to a spellbook or a great old one’s special ability. you cannot perform a unique action unless you are able to complete all parts of it. spellbook requirement actions found on the spellbook requirement slots on your faction card. most are not actions, but begin with the words as an/your action when they are. if a power cost is not indicated, they cost 0 power. unlimited actions you can perform as many unlimited actions as you wish in your turn, before and/or after a single common, unique, or spellbook requirement action. you may not take an unlimited action if you have 0 power. control or abandon gate: 0 power if you have a cultist in an area with an abandoned gate, move your cultist onto the gate to control it. you can also use this action to move a cultist off a gate, abandoning it. unlimited battle: 1 power (requires 6 spellbooks) the battle action becomes unlimited if you have 6 spellbooks on your faction card, allowing you to initiate as many battles as you wish before and/or after your single common, unique, or spellbook requirement action. however you can still only initiate 1 battle per area per action phase. ongoing special abilities ongoing special abilities are not actions and do not have a power cost, but they can take affect during the action phase. if 2 players want to use such an ability at the same time, resolve by turn order. 2. gather power phase all players can perform this phase simultaneously. players earn power, recording it on their power track. 1. earn 1 power for each cultist you have on the map. 2. earn 2 power for each gate you control. 3. each player earns 1 power for each abandoned gate on the map. 4. you must return all captured cultists to their owner’s pools, and earn 1 power for each cultist you return. 5. check for special abilities and spellbooks that provide power during this phase. you may have a power higher than 20 (‘wrap’ the marker around to the start of the track). at the end of this phase, if your power is less than half that of the player with the most power, set your power to be half of that player’s power (rounded up). 3. determine first player phase the player with the most power takes the first player marker. on a tie, the player who had the first player marker last round decides which of the tied players receives it (he may choose himself, if he is one of the tied players). the first player then chooses whether to have the marker’s clockwise or counterclockwise side faceup (point it in the appropriate direction if you are using another marker). this determines the order of play until the next determine first player phase and is done even if the first player is the first player in consecutive rounds. 4. doom phase 1. doom track advancement each player advances their doom marker on the doom track a number of spaces equal to their total number of controlled gates. 2. ritual of annihilation starting with the first player and proceeding in order of play, each player chooses to perform 1 ritual of annihilation or not. to perform a ritual of annihilation follow these steps:1. spend power equal to the current position of the ritual marker on the track. 2. advance the ritual marker 1 space up the track. 3. advance your doom marker on the doom track 1 space per gate you control. 4. for each goo you control in play, gain 1 elder sign trophy token. if the ritual marker is on 10 and a ritual is performed, the marker moves to the instant death space and at the end of the doom phase the game ends and victory is determined. all players who have not yet had a chance to perform a ritual may still do so when it is their turn (at a cost of 10 power). spellbooks, special abilities, and spellbook requirements may take effect in the doom phase, usually when it is your turn to perform a ritual of annihilation. if you can use multiple abilities or events, you may choose in which order to perform them. elder signs when you earn an elder sign trophy, take an elder sign token from the bag and (without revealing it to other players), place it facedown on your faction sheet. you may always examine your own elder sign chits. the number indicates how many doom points that elder sign is worth. there are 18 elder sign chits worth 1 point, 12 worth 2 points, and 6 worth 3 points. you decide when you gain the doom for an elder sign by revealing it and advancing your doom marker. elder signs may be revealed at any time (but are usually revealed at the end of the game). after revealing an elder sign, do not place it back into the bag; return it to the game box. if all elder signs are handed out to players and a new one is earned, that player receives a doom point instead. battles after a battle action has been declared and paid for, the battle follows these steps: 1. pre-battle abilities the attacker’s pre-battle optional abilities are applied first in any order, followed by the defender’s. if abilities eliminate a unit from the battle, that unit does not participate for the remainder of the battle, including the remainder of this segment. however, if that eliminated unit had already used an ability that generated an effect throughout the rest of the battle, that effect remains. 2. combat dice calculation & rolls each participant in the battle determines the total combat of all their units in the area, then rolls that many d6s. for each 6 rolled, score one kill result. for each 4 or 5, score a pain result. rolls of 1-3 have no effect. 3. post-battle abilities & assign battle results players simultaneously apply the results the enemy rolled to their own units. first, assign the kill results to your units. players may choose to use their optional post-battle abilities they have available. if such an ability adds an elimination result, it must be assigned at this point. excess kills and eliminations are ignored.a unit removed from the battle by a post-battle ability can still use its own post-battle abilities. some post-battle abilities can even be used by a faction not directly involved in the battle. after assigning all kills and eliminations, assign the pain results to your units. excess pains are ignored. post-battle abilities that modify pains may be appropriate to use when assigning pains. post-battle abilities (affecting both kills and pains) do not retroactively prevent other post-battle abilities from having taken place, even though they may modify the assigning of battle results due to already used post-battle abilities. 4. apply battle results after all battle results have been assigned, apply them to their respective units. kills and eliminations remove the unit from the map and back to their faction’s pool. then, pained units retreat and move to areas adjacent to the battle area. you choose where they retreat to. they do not need to all go to the same area, but can be split up among multiple areas if desired. the attacker applies pains first, followed by the defender. pained units cannot retreat into an area containing units belonging to the faction they just battled. they can retreat into an area containing units of a third faction. if one or more units cannot retreat, eliminate one of the pained units (even a goo). the rest may remain in the area with no further penalty. during the application of battle results some post-battle abilities may take effect. spellbooks spellbooks are new abilities your faction gains by meeting certain requirements. once earned, they remain in effect throughout the game. to earn spellbooks, fulfill one of the requirements listed on your faction card and take the spellbook of your choice and place it over that requirement. you never lose that spellbook, even if the requirement is no longer true. some spellbooks enable new actions unique to your faction. some are tied to particular units. many spellbook effects are ongoing. an ongoing effect is always available for free, once you have gained the spellbook. some ongoing spellbooks can take effect during an enemy’s turn. awakening your great old one each great old one has a high cost and specific requirements which must be fulfilled to bring it onto the map. in combat, a goo is treated as any other unit. they usually have special rules for how many dice they roll in combat. a single kill does eliminate your goo. ending and winning the game when a player advances his doom marker to 30 or more on the doom track, the game ends at the end of the doom phase (if the points were earned during the doom phase), or at the conclusion of the current player’s turn (if the points were revealed at another time). if the ritual of annihilation marker reaches the instant death space, and the game ends at the conclusion of this doom phase, all players who have not had a chance to perform a ritual of annihilation may still do so (at a cost of 10 power). at the end of that doom phase the game ends, even if no one has reached 30 or more doom points. no matter how the game end is triggered, all players may reveal all their elder signs before finally declaring victory. the player with the most doom and with 6 spellbooks on their faction card is the winner. if the player with the most doom does not have 6 spellbooks, whoever has the most doom among those with all 6 spellbooks is the winner. if there is a tie for the most doom, and both have all 6 spellbooks, the game ends in a draw. if the game ends and no player has all 6 spellbooks, humanity wins and all players lose together. two player game setup use the 3 player map and the 4 player ritual of annihilation track. place an unused faction’s doom marker at 0 on the doom track: this is now the decay marker. general rules when a unit is eliminated or killed, the opposing player gains doom equal to that unit’s power cost (when a unit is replaced by another, no doom is gained). where units have variable power costs, the doom gained is equal to the average of the unit’s different power costs added together (rounded up), whether or not the power benefit is currently in effect. units which are able to avoid death by means of abilities or spellbooks still provide doom to the enemy which ‘killed’ them, but only half as much (rounded up). action phase before taking your turn, you must pay power equal to the position of the decay marker on the doom track. this marker starts at 0, and then starts to increase when the other player runs out of power, penalizing you for taking multiple actions in a row. when unlimited battle is unlocked for a player, the other player also immediately gains unlimited battle . you cannot voluntarily drop to 0 power, if you have more than 1 power. you must perform an action on your turn. if you are out of power (or, for windwalker, if you are hibernating), when it would be your turn to take an action, increase the decay marker by 1. then the other player takes their turn. gather power phase return the decay marker to the 0 spot on the track at the start of this phase, then gain power as normal. doom phase you do not gain doom for simply controlling gates. the ritual of annihilation still produces doom equal to your controlled gates (plus an elder sign per faction goo in play). balance adjustments when rolling the die for ghroth, thousand forms, and dread curse of azathoth, the effects are halved (round up). opener of the way’s gate spellbook requirement for 12 gates is reduced to 10. yog-sothoth’s combat is always 4.1. action phase in order of play, each player takes 1 action until all are out of power. common actions recruit cultist: 1 power (requires a unit) you must have a unit (of any type) in the area where you recruit a cultist. if you have no units on the map, you do not need a unit in an area where the cultist is recruited. summon monster: varies (needs controlled gate) pay the monster’s cost. you must control a gate in the area where you summon the monster. awaken great old one: varies (requirements) consult the steps required to bring your goo into play. create gate: 3 power (requires cultist) you must have a cultist in an area and no gate. pay 3 power and place a gate there. immediately place the cultist atop the gate to indicate you now control it. move: 1 power per unit moved for each power you spend, you may move 1 unit from its current area into an adjacent area. you cannot move a unit more than once per action.battle: 1 power (requires unit with at least 1 combat) choose any area in which both you and an enemy faction have at least 1 unit. you must have at least 1 combat in order to declare a battle. capture cultist: 1 power if you have a monster or goo in an area, and an enemy has cultists, but no monsters or goos, you may capture an enemy cultist and place it on your faction card. to protect against capture, you need a protector of your own there: goos outrank monsters, monsters outrank cultists, and cultists cannot capture cultists. unique actions actions unique to a particular faction. you cannot perform a unique action unless you are able to complete all parts of it. spellbook requirement actions if a power cost is not indicated, they cost 0 power. unlimited actions you can perform as many unlimited actions as you wish in your turn. you may not take one if you have 0 power. control or abandon gate: 0 power move your cultist onto an abandoned gate to control it, or move a cultist off a gate,

encounter deck. each player takes a character sheet and places a green bead on the 100 life points number. place the monster life tracker on the table. one yellow bead tracks the life points of creatures, while another tracks the number of encounters faced. sequence of play 1. begin a new encounter a. reveal the top card of the encounter deck one player reads the card aloud. place a yellow bead on the monster life tracker equal to its starting life points (depending on the number of players that started the game). players take any potions they wish to use before or during this encounter. draw initiative. each player draws an initiative card and places it faceup beside their character sheet. 2. combat round a. set attack cards each player places 1 attack card facedown in front of them (it may be changed before the first attack card is revealed, but never after). if you have no attack cards, set an action card as a bluff; it is discarded without effect when revealed. a set attack card not played for any reason is discarded at the end of the round. b. player turns each player takes a turn in order of initiative, starting with player 1. on a player’s turn he flips his set attack card and inflicts damage or follows the rules on the card. place successfully played attack cards in a damage stack beside the encounter card so the top-most damage number of all cards is visible. when facing a token-based encounter, spread out the tokens and have players place their attack cards on the specific token they wish to hit. unless otherwise noted, only the last token qualifies for bonus prestige in a bonus round. check to see if the player has killed the creature or completed the encounter after each attack card is played. if not, the next player in initiative order takes his turn. when all players have had a turn, the party’s combat round is over. c. total attack damage total the damage of the attack cards in the damage stack and adjust the creature’s life

refer to damage done this round. e. discard attack cards discard the attack cards on the damage stack. f. draw initiative for next roundg. random creature attacks when a creature attacks a random

character sheet, plus any additional prestige tokens due to special rules or bonuses. players may discard any number of cards from their hand. players draw new cards to their maximum hand size (normally 7 cards). if at any time you have more than your maximum hand size, immediately discard cards of your choice that exceed that number. advance the yellow bead on the monster life tracker to the next encounter and begin the new encounter. cards if more than one player wants to play a card at the same time, the player with the initiative card closest to 1 takes priority. attack cards (red combat icon) standard attack cards show the damage inflicted this turn. half/halving damage means rotating the card to the next lowest damage value; double/doubling means rotating it to the next highest value. if there is no higher value, it cannot be doubled further. some standard attack cards have special attacks with higher attack values for the character pictured only. special attacks are protected: once revealed, it cannot be affected by unwanted action cards. using the special attack is never mandatory. enhanced attack cards have additional abilities that affect yours or other players’ attacks. tactical maneuvers are other strategic moves and do not hit or inflict damage. feint cannot be made to hit or inflict damage by other cards and effects. stand in (double strike, opportunity fire) cards are immediately replaced with new cards when revealed. only the actual attack card that results can be affected by other cards or effects. edge out can target any set, facedown attack card, but not a card that replaces a stand in card. the exception is the second attack card resulting from opportunity fire, as it sends up set facedown. riders (focus strength, slip behind) cause subsequent attack cards to be modified. when played they ‘stand-by’ in front of that character’s character sheet until they modify an attack card, when they are placed on the damage stack along with it. this is always considered a single attack. if an attack card with a rider is further modified, rotate both cards. a single attack card may have multiple additive riders, but only one multiplicative rider. apply effects in the order played. action cards (blue oval icon) action cards are not set for combat, but always played directly from your hand, and sometimes out of turn or at a specific time. not so tough/tougher than he looks may be played for either of its effects.item cards (jewel-shaped icon) when you draw an item card, immediately place it faceup beside your character sheet. it does not count as a card in your hand and may stay there until you are ready to use it. to use an item, state you are doing so. potions are ‘tipped to drink’: rotated 90º clockwise (once tipped, they may not be stolen or affected by other game effects). healing potions can be used to aid other willing players, granting prestige points if used in this way (place the card on your prestige pile). potions and alchemist fire are one-use items and are removed from play after use. they can also be used in negotiations between players. winning the game when then last encounter is defeated, the game is over. the player with the most prestige points wins. if there is a tie, draw a random encounter card from the cards set aside at the beginning of the game and begin a new encounter. continue until the tie is broken at the end of an encounter. dead players if a player dies they are out of the game. remove the highest initiative card from the game. if the player died with an item, their body may be looted: at the end of the encounter, draw initiative. in initiative order, players may choose an item from the dead player. expansion 1: deeper & darker character abilities each character has a unique character ability. to use an ability, state you are doing so; it immediately takes affect. in non-bonus rounds, any associated attacks linked to that ability are immediately immune to ‘unwanted’ action cards. from round 7, the attack may be targeted by action cards as normal. if talon and orn try to use their ability at the same time, the first one to speak gets priority, or the player with the initiative card closest to 1 takes priority. expansion 2: relics & ruin the event deck shuffle the event cards (those with a star are particularly deadly) and place them facedown on the table near the encounter deck. whenever an encounter card is revealed, check the type of encounter. if the encounter is creature-based, draw an event card and place it faceup next to the encounter card. note what number encounter you face (on the monster tracker) and if that number appears on the activation track of the event card, the event is activated: read it aloud. otherwise, discard the card without effect. as a general rule, events! activate immediately and treasures! are resolved at the end of the encounter. relic cards relic cards are items that can only be earned through the event deck. they can be affected by cards that interact with items. relic cards are placed faceup next to a player’s character sheet and can be used any time, subject to the limitations on the card. poison when poisoned, a player places a poison token on their character sheet. at the end of every round, players with a poison token are damaged for 5 points for each poison token they have. they also have all their attacks modified by -10 damage for each token. the effect of these tokens is cumulative. a player may only remove one poison token at the end of every encounter. a poison attack can be redirected, but once poisoned, the damage cannot be. encounters vampyre players who have become vampyres are not creatures; they are still players and act on their regular turn in initiative order. they do not play attack cards, but select a player without a vampyre token to damage for 5 points. they can play action cards normally. when the vampyre dies, all ‘turned’ players revert to their natural state (keeping the lp and negative prestige points they gained).wereboar a player turned into a wereboar at the end of the game does become a creature; he is no longer a player and can no longer win the game by having the most prestige. he cannot have his items taken, nor can he use them. a player who is now a wereboar can win the game by killing the rest of the party. gluttony amulet of mentalism: adjusts your maximum hand size to 8 cards; you may still draw up to 14 cards. “we fight in too close a quarters” event: you may still draw up to 14 cards, though gluttony will be powered up even more.“a blessing of daylight” event: increases your maximum hand size by one; therefore to 15 cards. the first card drawn to increase your hand size is free and does not trigger gluttony’s effect. “bring the chest. we’ll solve the riddle later” event only attack cards with attack values in the red burst are used; discard any other cards. if an item is discarded in this way, it is not removed from the game. to count as a match, only the attack value of played attack cards is considered, not the name of the card. expansion 3: tombs & tomes the adventure modules each adventure module is a one-shot, self-guided, rpg-style story; basic game play has not changed. if you wish to replay an adventure module, allow other players who have not played it to make all the decisions. if you must make a decision, do so at random. quest cards without an adventure module, quest cards can add to the winning conditions of the standard game. encounters emperor lich emperor lich should be treated as a boss encounter. this encounter is resolved in 3 phases: 1. the players who have survived to this final encounter must battle a skeleton token for every player. 2. the players who died prior to this encounter engage the party in battle; they are considered creatures (they do not get dealt initiative cards and attack at the end of the round). they must discard and redraw any action cards or items they draw other than critical miss or trip. you may counter strike them. 3. finally, the party must fight the lich. killing the lich is the only part of the encounter that grants bonus prestige. hivemind if the hivemind attacks in a round where a player has played i think he called you ugly too, the specific token that was attacked with that card splits off from the group and attacks the named player (it does not redirect the entire swarm). thantigist when you physically switch seats, you effectively become the other character and now hold their hand, life points, prestige and items. ragnarok you can’t pick and choose whom to bring back, and you don’t have to bring anyone back to life, but you may need their help ... barrier magus knocking down the barrier is not a creature attack, so you can’t play counter strike. if his barrier is up, the magus attacks; if the barrier is down, he raises his barrier instead of attacking. “t’is the fog of war” event all cards are played hidden; tell other players what it is without actually showing it. move the bead on the monster track as the damage is announced in this particular case. skip this event if it comes up with a creature that plays havoc with the damage stack! if you lie and are challenged, the card is countered and you lose 3 prestige (if you didn’t lie, they lose 1 prestige).expansion 4: fresh meat new main deck cards shuffle the 13 new main deck cards into the main deck. ‘strike and evade’ protected attack cards if your character portrait appears on the bottom of the card, you may play the card for double damage and protected. when a creature is hit by a ‘strike and evade’ it will not attack you that round. if it would attack multiple players, it will continue to do so (only you are ignored). players may redirect damage through my hero and human shield as normal. strike of destiny a protected attack that any character may use. however, the attack cannot be rotated to a value higher than 35. all modifications that do not rotate the card modify the attack normally. playing edge out on this card is legal and prevents the attack from hitting, but at a cost to the player that played edge out. if i can’t have it makes sure you get another shot next turn. impressive move ‘single attack’ means a ‘separate attack’. snicker-snackt provides for an attack of 60 damage or more. only attack cards with an attack value printed are considered; those without an attack value are not used and discarded. takin’ one for the team another way to gain prestige, by taking a creature attack due another player. the damage and effects of that attack may not be redirected by any means. unwitting assist you can change their attack card (it remains their attack, not yours). new relics cards the 11 new relics can be used in isolation or shuffled into your deck. new event cards when you are ready to use a full event deck, shuffle these into your event deck. should a trap activate, it is resolved before the encounter begins, rather than modify the encounter itself. summoning gate is intended for the larger set of encounters and events from all expansions. new characters players should decide whether to use the pre-generated characters or draft reputation cards to customize their own characters. character reputations are not secret, and it is never mandatory to take them. when using character reputations, do not use the one-use abilities from deeper & darker. if you are playing a new character, place a character token of a base game character not being used on your character card as a reminder of which attack card character portraits you will use for protected attacks. pre-generated characters the pre-generated character side of a character card has a set of themed reputations. take the matching reputation cards and place them faceup beside your character card. each of your reputations has a cost that lowers your lp total (the lp tracks have already been adjusted). a player cannot gain life greater than his starting lps. to select a character, draw initiative and have players choose one, starting with player 1; or choose randomly. custom characters quick draft shuffle the reputation cards and deal 5 facedown to each player. you may choose any number of these for your character, but there is a cost in lps for each you take (build points). you may never heal yourself higher than your starting lp total. standard draft shuffle the reputation cards and deal 5 facedown to each player. look at your 5 cards and choose one. choosing a card in the draft does not necessarily mean you must use the card or pay its cost; you must participate in the draft, even if you have no intention of using any of the reputation cards. pass the remaining 4 cards to the player on your left. players then choose one of these 4, passing 3 to the left, and so on until all have been chosen. each player will end up with 5 reputation cards. players each then decide which of the drafted cards they will use, if any. negative effects a negative card is any card that acts on a player in an unwanted or damaging way. cards like twist the knife, not so tough and rally do not count, unless they have been played to draw an attack from a creature who targets players who swing hardest in a round. tougher than he looks and crowd only qualify if you would have scored a kill otherwise or if it was played to draw the attack of a creature targeting the lightest swing and you are hit as a result. alchemist fire does not target you directly and is not counted. nor is simply playing a standard attack card that scores another player the kill before you. new encounters endless horde of dead when an undead is put into play, place the undead token with the approaching side faceup showing that it will not attack in the first round it appears. at the beginning of the following round flip the token to the attacking side. during the actual encounter, a player may attack any undead token in play, even those in front of other players. on subsequent encounters, a player may attack the current encounter or an undead token, if one is in front of them. a player may not ignore the current encounter to attack an undead in front of another player, unless that player asks them for help. once the current encounter is defeated, all remaining undead must be killed and a player may attack any undead in play. if you run out of tokens, use +1 prestige tokens instead. arena of souls attacks from other players directed at you, even in spirit form, are not creature attacks. when the battle goes down to 2 players facing off, human shield, my hero and i think he called you ugly cannot be played to redirect an attack back upon the attacker. rebeast when damage is reflected back on you from an ‘overkill’, you may not redirect that damage to another player. if rebeast drops to exactly 0 lps and still has counters on it, it respawns with 1o lp + 2 x the value of the killing attack. when the last prestige is removed, the encounter is over. no overkill damage applies to the final blow. crumbling caverns/portals & portents if you are playing only the encounters from fresh meat, use only one of these so they don’t both come up in a single game. in crumbling caverns, players may not specifically state what their card was, but may influence the vote of the party with a strong warning or encouragement to move forward, based on the card they drew. in portals & portents, the encounters are read to everyone before your 1 minute debate on how to build your 3 piles begins. east flow dragon if you get another match immediately in your redraw of cards, you may use them right away. matching refers only to whatever appears in the card’s title (inside the red burst, blue oval gem). it must match exactly. things outside of the title don’t matter. goblin bomber multiple bombs may be in front of a single player. death drinker boss encounters, when revealed before the final encounter of the game, do something bad to the party and then drop to the bottom of the encounter stack to be faced as the final boss encounter. there is only ever one boss in a game. if you encounter others, fight any subsequent boss encounters as they are revealed, using only the text of how they function as a ‘final’ encounter. if the boss, after being placed at the bottom of the deck, ends up being reshuffled, repeat its nasty effect if re-encountered before the final encounter. arrogance is not a boss encounter. humility & shame when the creatures look for which player did the most or least damage to a creature, they look overall at all attacks done, regardless of which creature you had swung at. blink dogs blink dogs attack players immediately when they are first put into play. they do not attack at the end of a round, but only when they move to a new player. i think he called you ugly too allows the player to send the dog to a player he or she chooses. cursed naiad/spitting drake 6 hold/strike cards are used for these encounters. as you set your attack, hide the hold/strike card underneath your set attack, with your choice faceup. when you reveal your attack, your choice to hold or strike is revealed. treasure spore the treasure spore encounter is distinct from the protospore creature tokens and they attack differently. the treasure spore attacks the last player to damage it. then, if there are any protospores in play at the end of the round, the tokens remove any damage on themselves. in addition, each token heals the treasure spore for 30 lp each. protospores all attack player #1 in the next initiative draw. if the treasure spore is ‘killed’ while protospores are still in play, the treasure spore does not die. instead, discard all protospore tokens and heal treasure spore 30 lp for each discarded. killing treasure spore not only gains prestige, but a relic as well, in addition to any treasure event card that may be active at the time. rock elemental if all players lose their turn, players draw a card before the elemental attacks again immediately. shadowmancer the first round of attacks go through without problem. when initiative is drawn for subsequent rounds, the new player #1 must beat the previous player #1’s attack."
76,54998,CYCLADES,2010,ASMODEE,2.8157,1004,"setup each player chooses a color and takes his screen, 1 offering marker (2 in a 2 player game), 3 territory tokens, 8 fleets and 8 troops. each player also takes 5 gold pieces (gp) and hides them behind his screen. place the isles, troops and fleets according to the number of players, as indicated in the rules. shuffle the mythological creature cards and place them facedown on their board space. place the 5 creature figurines next to the discard pile (you cannot normally look in the discard pile during the game). place the philosopher cards and the priest cards on their board spaces. shuffle together the players’ offering markers and randomly place them on the first spaces of the game turn track. the 4 god tiles go next to the board, along with the building tiles, the metropolis tiles, the 2 dice, the prosperity markers and the unused gold pieces. overview the game takes place over a series of cycles during which the players will: 1. gather their revenue in gp (production of their isles + seafaring commerce) 2. make offerings to the gods (auction). 3. depending on the god whose favor they obtained, perform actions specific to that god. the goal of each player is to own 2 metropolises at the end of a cycle (either by building them and/or conquering them). cycle 1. mythological creatures update the mythological creature track to have 3 visible creatures, one on each space. the gp under each space is the cost to use that creature during the action phase. 1. discard the creature on the 2 gp space if it wasn’t used during the previous round. 2. move all other cards to the right. 3. fill the remaining spaces by drawing new cards. when the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile to create a new draw pile. during the very first cycle, draw the first mythological creature and place it faceup on the 4 gp space. during the second cycle, if this creature has not been used, move it one square to the right and put the first creature from the draw pile faceup on the vacated space. if it was used, place the 2 first creatures from the draw pile on the 4 gp and 3 gp spaces.2. the gods the 4 god tiles are shuffled and placed randomly on the 4 empty spaces above apollo’s space. 5 players: all 4 tiles are placed faceup. 4 players: the last of the 4 gods is placed facedown; it will not be available for this cycle. during the following cycle, place this god faceup in the first space, and shuffle the other 3. once again, the god placed in 4th place will be facedown and will become first god during the following cycle. 3 players: the first 2 gods are placed faceup and the last 2 facedown. during the next cycle, the 2 gods which were facedown are used. on the cycle following that, the 4 gods are shuffled again to make 2 new random pairs. 3. revenues each player receives 1 gp for each prosperity marker he controls. gp earned by the players is kept hidden. 4. offerings in playing order, each player chooses a god and places his offering marker on the space corresponding to the offering that the player wishes to make. if an offering goes over 10, the player places one of his territory markers on the 10+ space. the offering marker then indicates any number beyond 10. a god grants his favor only to the player who made the highest offering. if a player has made an offering to an already chosen god, the offering must be higher than the one already taking place, and the player who made the previous offering must take his marker back and immediately bid on a different god. the player thus outbid may outbid another player. any such case must be resolved before the next player in the playing order places his offering marker. any player may place his offering marker on apollo’s space without cost; he does not require any offerings. multiple players may choose apollo in the same cycle. the first player to choose apollo places his token on the 1 space, the second on the 2 space, etc. the offering phase is over when each player has placed his marker on a god. each player pays the number of gp he offered, taking into account any possible reductions due to priest cards. players cannot make an offering they can’t afford. 5. performing actions the player who won the offering bid on the first god can perform the actions specific to that god, and use a mythological creature, by paying the cost corresponding to each of those actions. the free action of each god must be taken, and it must be completed first.call upon one or more mythological creatures (all gods except apollo) recruit (all gods except apollo) build (all gods except apollo)special action (all gods except athena and apollo) increase revenue (apollo) players may alternate actions (eg, recruit, build and recruit again). when a player is done with his actions, he places his offering marker on the last free space of the turn track. the player who won the offering bid on the next god then performs his actions. a. call one or more mythological creatures by paying the cost indicated under the card (minus any cost reductions due to temples) the player can take the corresponding creature card and apply its effect. once used, the card is placed faceup in the discard pile. the powers of the creatures must be used immediately. new creature cards are only placed on the board at the beginning of each cycle. the player who made the best offering to the first god gets to help himself first. there is nothing to stop him from playing multiple creatures, so it is possible that the last few players of the cycle will no longer have any creatures available to them by the time their turn comes around. b. recruit the main gods allow players to recruit—depending on their specialty—a troop, a fleet, a priest or a philosopher for free, but also to recruit more in exchange for gp. c. build a specific type of building is associated with each god, each building with a different effect. a player may build the same type of building multiple times, even on the same isle, as long as he can afford the cost of 2 gp each. buildings are placed on the white squares of each isle. d. special action some gods grant special actions. during his turn, a player may perform these actions multiple times, as long as he has enough gp to afford them. e. apollo finally, the player(s) who have chosen apollo play last and have a limited choice of actions. playing apollo is technically a way to skip one’s turn to save money. 6. end of the round once every player has played and placed their offering marker on the turn track, the round is finished. if one or more players own 2 metropolises, the game ends. otherwise, a new cycle begins.the gods poseidon recruit fleets free fleet. you may purchase extra fleets: the second costs 1 gp, the third 2 gp, and the fourth 3 gp. you cannot purchase more than 3 extra fleets in a turn. no player may have more than 8 fleets. fleets must be built on sea spaces around isles you control. this space must either be empty or contain your fleets. build port a port gives a defensive bonus during sea-faring battles that take place on squares adjacent to the isle it is on. move fleets for 1 gp, you may choose fleets currently on the same sea space and move them a maximum of 3 spaces. you can add or abandon fleets during that movement. if fleets enter a space occupied by enemy fleets, their movement ends and a battle begins immediately. ares recruit troops free troop. you may purchase extra troops: the second costs 2 gp, the third 3 gp, and the fourth 4 gp. you cannot purchase more than 3 extra troops in a turn. no player may have more than 8 troops. troops must be placed on isles you control. build fortress a fortress gives a defensive bonus during land-based battles to troops on the same isle. move troops for 1 gp, you may move some or all of your troops on an isle to another isle connected by a chain of fleets of your color. if you land on an isle where enemy troops are present, a battle starts immediately. if you land on an isle free of troops, you claim it without a battle, even if the isle has a fortress. if you move your last troop off an isle, you must leave a territory marker there. the isle belongs to you as long as no opponent lands there. a player may not attack the last isle of another player, unless he can prove that he would win the game were he to sucessfully conquer the isle. zeus recruit priests free priest. you may purchase a single extra priest for 4 gp. priests are kept in plain sight. each priest reduces the offering to be paid by 1 gp at the beginning of each cycle. no matter how many priests you have, you must pay at least 1 gp for your offering (only apollo is free). build temple each temple reduces the cost of buying a mythological creature by 1 gp. the price reduction of each temple can only be used once per cycle. no matter how many temples you own, you must still spend at least 1 gp to get a creature. change the creatures for 1 gp, you can discard an available creature card and replace it with the first card of the draw pile. athena recruit philosophers free philosopher. you may purchase a single extra philosopher for 4 gp. philosophers are kept in plain sight. as soon as you get a fourth philosopher, you must immediately discard them to build a metropolis. build university the university has no special effect. apollo you get 1 gp if you control more than one isle, or 4 gp if you control a single isle. you also place 1 prosperity marker on the isle of your choice. an isle can have several markers on it. if more than one player has chosen apollo during a single round, all earn the extra gp, but only the first player who chose apollo gets a prosperity marker. battle each player participating in battle rolls 1 die and adds the number of troops / fleets he has in the combat zone. if the battle takes place on an isle where one or more fortresses have been built, the defender adds 1 to his for each fortress. if the battle takes place on a sea space adjacent to an isle (or isles) where the defender has built one or more ports, the defender adds 1 for each port. an isle is always considered to be a single space. the player with the lowest result loses the first assault. he removes a troop / fleet from the battle and places it in his reserve (in front of his screen). if the result is a tie, both players lose a troop / fleet. if both combatants still have troops / fleets, the defender can decide to retreat. if he does not (or cannot), the attacker can also retreat. if neither of the players retreat, a new assault takes place. these steps are repeated until only one player is left in the combat zone. that player takes control of the isle or the sea space in which battle occurred. if it was an isle, the winner also gets all buildings found on the isle. two armies may annihilate themselves at the same time. in the case of a land-based battle, the defender keeps his isle and a territory marker of his color on it. he still benefits from the revenues of that isle and the effects of buildings on it, but it will no longer be defended against a subsequent attack until he recruits new troops.retreating during a land-based battle the player wishing to retreat must bring his troops back to an isle belonging to him and linked by fleets of his color to the one where battle occurred. if these conditions are not met, the troops cannot retreat. retreating during a sea-faring battle the player wishing to retreat must move his fleets to an empty adjacent space or one he controls. if no space is available, the fleets cannot retreat. the metropolises each isle has a space (dotted red square) reserved for a metropolis. there are two ways of creating a metropolis: 1. economic development a player who owns all 4 types of buildings (port, fortress, temple and university), even if they are spread over many isles, must immediately discard them and replace them with a metropolis, which he places on an empty space on one of his isles. if there are no free spaces, the player must destroy one or more of his buildings to free the space. 2. intellectual development a player who has 4 philosophers must immediately discard them to earn a metropolis, which he places on an empty space on one of his isles. if the only available space is occupied by buildings, the player must destroy them to free the space. if a player only has one isle on which he already owns a metropolis, his 4 philosophers are discarded (the new metropolis ‘replaces’ the old one). a player can also earn a metropolis by conquering an isle where one already exists. a metropolis has the powers of all other buildings. victory the game ends at the end of a cycle where at least one player owns 2 metropolises. that player wins. if more than a single player ends the cycle with 2 metropolises, the player who has the most gp remaining behind his screen wins. 2 player game each player takes the 2 offering markers of his color. shuffle the 4 offering markers and place them randomly on the first spaces of the turn track. play exactly as detailed for 4 players, but each player must make offerings to 2 gods instead of a single one (it is possible to outbid yourself). each player must be able to pay the entire cost of his offerings on both chosen gods. a priest allows a player to save 1 gp on the sum of your offerings. the game ends when one of the players owns 3 (instead of 2) metropolises at the end of a cycle."
77,111124,DARK MOON,2015,STRONGHOLD GAMES,2.3701,127,"setup place 2 shield tokens on the first 2 spots of the shield track and the remaining 4 in a pile. place the sabotage, die, and quarantine tokens next to the board. randomly draw and place 2 outpost tokens on the appropriate spots on the outpost status panel (their effects apply immediately). place the rest in a facedown pile. place the red suspicion cube at the beginning of the vote track, a single blue and black cube above the difficulty track, and the remaining blue event cubes next to the board. shuffle the character cards and deal 1 faceup to each player. each player takes the matching uninfected player screen and 2 black strong dice, 2 red weak dice, and a participation token. randomly draw fatigue tokens until you draw one that matches a character in play. that character is the starting commander and takes the commander card and the blue commander die. randomly draw (or players can choose) a final event card and place it faceup on the camera 4 space on the board. place the other final event cards back in the box. determine how many uninfected and infected status cards and which deck of task cards to use: 3 players: 1 infected status card, 2 uninfected status cards, silver task deck (remove the voluntary blood testing card). 4 players: 1 infected status card, 3 uninfected status cards, black task deck (remove the voluntary blood testing card). 5 players: 2 infected status cards, 3 uninfected status cards, silver task deck. 6 players: 2 infected status cards, 4 uninfected status cards, black task deck. 7 players: 3 infected status cards, 4 uninfected status cards, silver task deck. shuffle the infected status cards, randomly select the number required, and place them facedown. place any unused infected status cards back in the box without looking at them. form the status deck by shuffling the selected infected status cards with the required number of ininfected status cards. deal 1 status card to each player, facedown. one player gives a steady count to 10, while all players silently read their status card at the same time. players must not put their cards down until the count is completed. shuffle the appropriate task deck and shuffle the event deck and place both decks next to the board. the commander draws 2 event cards, choosing 1 to place faceup on the board on the camera 1 spot, and the other to go to the bottom of the event deck (no other player should see this discarded card). the player to the left of the commander is the starting player and play proceeds clockwise. submitted dice go to the spent resources space. after an action or task has been resolved, submitted dice are moved from the spent resources space to the available resources space.game turn 1. retrieve dice skip this step at the start of the game as everyone will have their maximum number of dice. the active player retrieves as many dice from the available resources space as needed to meet their die limit. you may choose any combination of red weak or black strong dice. only the commander may retrieve the commander die (this die does not count towards the commander’s die limit). 2. perform an action the active player may perform 1 of the following actions. players cannot perform actions that have been blocked with an outpost token. repair choose 1 of the following repair actions. roll up to 3 (or fewer) of your dice and submit 1. if the die you submit is positive, the action is successful. if the die you submit is negative, the action fails. repair shield if there are shield tokens on the board. if successful, remove the shield token farthest on the shield dial. repair life support if players have become fatigued. if successful, any 1 fatigue token may be removed from the board and shuffled back into the pile of fatigue tokens. you do not have to declare which fatigue token you intend to remove before making the attempt. repair outpost if an action has been blocked with an outpost token. if successful, any 1 outpost token may be removed from the board and shuffled back into the pile of outpost tokens. that action is now available for players to use. you do not have to declare which outpost token you intend to remove before making the attempt. this is the only action that is always available to players, no matter which stations have been damaged. call a vote call a vote to either quarantine a player or release a player from quarantine (you may call a vote on yourself). all players then hold out a closed fist and simultaneously reveal. a black strong die is a vote that the player is uninfected and should not be in quarantine. a red weak die is a vote that the player is infected and should be in quarantine. an empty hand means the player has abstained from the vote. the commander die may not be used to cast a vote. you may have to abstain if you have no active dice or do not have the color of die you want to vote with. you may also willingly abstain, even if you have dice you could vote with. if the majority vote uninfected, the player is either released from quarantine or remains free from quarantine. if the majority vote infected, the player is either placed in quarantine or remains in quarantine. on a tie, the commander breaks the tie however they wish. after the vote, players place any dice they used in the vote behind their player screen with their other active dice. lone wolf the active player may attempt to add an event cube to the current event by themselves. roll up to 3 of your dice and submit 2. if both submitted dice are positive, the action succeeds and an event cube is added to the current event or final event card. if the event is then completed, the commander immediately draws 2 new event cards and chooses 1 before the active player’s turn continues. if the final event is completed, the uninfected team immediately wins the game. issue order the active player may choose another player and issue an order to them. this costs no dice, but the ordered player is under no obligation to follow the instructions. the ordered player may either retrieve 2 spent dice (observing their die limit) or perform any 2 actions they would normally be able to perform (neither of those actions may be issue order). if upon receiving an order, a player’s first action is reveal as infected, they may immediately perform an infected action. a player given an order may not use their character ability while performing actions (as they are not currently the active player). reveal as infected a player with an infected status card may reveal it and publicly switch to the infected team. 3. choose a task card the active player draws 2 task cards and chooses 1 to play faceup on the current task space. the other card is discarded facedown to the discard space. if there are no cards to draw, take all discarded cards, shuffle them, and create a new task deck (do not reveal the task cards in the facedown discard pile). 4. resolve task malfunction tasks malfunction tasks require players to collectively roll their dice in an attempt to fix the malfunction (or, in the case of the infected players, possibly cause everyone to fail). place the blue difficulty cube on the appropriate number on the difficulty track, and the black success cube on 0 on the difficulty track. starting with the active player and going clockwise, each player and infected player flips their participation token to the in or out side. if a player or infected player is out, they immediately take up to 2 dice from the available resources space (without exceeding their die limit). each player or infected player who is in, starting with the active player and going clockwise, rolls and submits dice. no one may roll dice and see their results until it is their turn to submit dice. all players and infected players who are participating in the task must roll and submit at least 1 die. players and infected players may reroll their dice as many times as they choose. however, every time you roll your dice you must submit at least 1 of those dice (and may submit more than 1); even if the outcome of the malfunction appears inevitable. every time a die is submitted, move the black success cube up or down on the difficulty track the appropriate number. each positive die submitted counts toward success; each negative die toward failure. the numbers shown on the track are not limits.place submitted dice on the spent resources space on the board. after the task has been resolved (but before consequences occur or event cubes are added) move all dice from the spent resources space to the available resources space. once all players and infected players who participated have rolled and submitted at least 1 die each, check the total. if the final result is equal to or higher than the difficulty number, the task is successful. if the result is lower than the difficulty number, the task fails and the consequence listed on the malfunction card occurs. outpost malfunction randomly draw and place a number of outpost tokens on the outpost status section equal to the red consequence number. if the sixth outpost token is placed, the infected team immediately wins. each outpost token prevents the players from taking certain actions until the station is repaired: shield control: repair shield actions may not be used.life support: repair life support actions may not be used. research lab: call vote actions may not be used (this does not apply to forced votes that occur when the suspicion cube reaches the end of the suspicion track). communications: issue order actions may not be used.hangar bay: lone wolf actions may not be used. command: players retrieve 1 fewer die when passing on a malfunction task (this does not affect the number of dice players retrieve at the beginning of their turn, nor does it affect a player who is issued an order and chooses to retrieve dice). life support malfunction randomly draw and place a number of fatigue tokens on the life support section equal to the red consequence number. if the sixth fatigue token is placed, the infected team immediately wins. if the character on the token is in play, that character becomes fatigued. if the character on the token is not in play, the fatigue token still counts toward the infected team’s win condition but does not penalize a player. shield malfunction place a number of shield tokens equal to the red consequence number on the next available spots on the shield track. if the sixth shield token is placed, the infected team immediately wins. after placing the tokens test the shields. check the current failure condition (-1, any +, -2, or any -). roll any die available (if there are no dice on the board, a player may roll one of their own, but it is not submitted; the color of the die does not matter). if the result matches the failure condition, the shield test has failed and the active player must choose to either draw a fatigue token or draw an outpost token. ?????????? malfunction the active player may choose which malfunction occurs: an outpost, life support, or shield malfunction. the choice must be made before players and infected players choose to participate and roll dice. complication tasks complication tasks feature an illustration and require the player(s) to make a choice. the player(s) must make a choice. if they succeed, the task is successful. if they fail, the consequence on the card occurs.5. add an event cube (conditional) if the task was successful, add a blue event cube on the next available empty spot, either on the current event or final event card. players cannot place event cubes on the final event card until the 3 previous events have been completed (with the exception of when the tactical prep event card is completed). 6. complete the event (conditional) if the last event cube was added to an event card, that event is completed. execute the event text on the card if applicable. if the completed event was the final event, the uninfected team wins the game. if the event card, when completed, calls for damage tokens to be added, add them until just before doing so would cause the game to end in an infected victory. however if a final event card calls for adding damage tokens and doing so would cause the game to end in an infected victory, the infected team wins. 7. select a new event (conditional) if an event was successfully completed, the commander draws 2 more event cards, placing 1 faceup on the board in the next spot and discarding the second facedown. if it was the 3rd completed event, players immediately proceed to the final event and the commander does not draw any cards. 8. advance suspicion cube (conditional) if the task card said !!!suspicious activity!!! move the red suspicion cube 1 space forward on the suspicion track, regardless of whether the task succeeded or failed. 9. hold a vote (conditional) if the suspicion cube has reached the final space on the suspicion track, a vote must now be called. the active player must choose a player to vote on (you may choose yourself or a quarantined player). after the vote, reset the suspicion cube on the track. even if the research lab outpost token is on the board, it does not prevent this mandatory vote from occurring. play then proceeds clockwise to the next player. events and final events event text on events takes place at the following times: at start: a one time effect that takes place as soon as the event is played. during: a persistent effect that takes place as long as the event is the current event. upon completion: a one time effect that takes place as soon as the event is completed. when the final event begins, take all remaining and discarded task cards and remove all complication tasks and place them back in the box (they will no longer be used). shuffle and form a new malfunction-only task deck with the remaining cards. do not reveal the task cards in the facedown discard pile, as this could unfairly reveal how players have acted when choosing tasks.quarantine when a player is placed in quarantine, place a quarantine token in front of their player screen, covering up 2 of their die icons: their die limit is now reduced by 2 dice. if that player has more active dice behind their screen than their current die limit allows, they must discard the extra dice to the available resources space. on a quarantined player’s turn:• retrieve dice up to your die limit as usual. • you may only use the actions call vote, issue order, and reveal as infected. if call vote and issue order have been blocked by outpost tokens and you are not infected, then you have no available actions. • you do not draw task cards at the end of your turn. after performing an action, play passes to the next player. quarantined players may still participate in votes and tasks normally. a quarantined player who is released discards their quarantine token and their die limit is increased by 2 dice (do not automatically retrieve those dice, however). players always have access to at least 1 die, even if being quarantined would reduce their die limit to 0 or fewer dice. a commander who is successfully quarantined loses the commander card to the player who called the vote. if the player who called the vote is in quarantine themselves (or if the commander called the vote on themselves), the commander card passes to the first player to the left who is not in quarantine. if all players who are not revealed as infected end up in quarantine, the last player to be quarantined retains the commander card. the first player to be released from quarantine immediately becomes the commander. fatigue when a fatigue token is drawn, if it matches a character in play, that player must flip their character card over. they can no longer use their character’s special ability, and may only submit 1 die during a malfunction task. if the fatigue token is removed due to a successful repair life support action, the player flips their character card back over, has access to their character ability again, and can roll and submit dice normally. testing the shield any time shield tokens are drawn, the active player always rolls a die to test the shields. place all shield tokens on the board in the next available spots on the shield track before rolling the die. if the roll matches the current failure condition on the shield track (the first symbol visible after the last token on the track: -1, any +, -2, or any -), the active player chooses to either draw a fatigue token or draw an outpost token. revealing as infected if you reveal as infected: • if not quarantined, execute the infection power on your status card immediately. • roll any available die; if the result is positive, you may execute your infection power a second time.• discard your character card, quarantine token (if quarantined), any die tokens, and your uninfected player screen. if you were the commander, the commander card now passes to the first uninfected player to the left and the commander die is placed in the available resources space. • take an infected player screen. observing your new die limit, discard down to 2 dice, returning any extra dice to the available resources space. • your turn is immediately over (unless you revealed as a result of the issue order action and revealing was your first action; in which case you may immediately perform an infected action). players who have openly declared for the infected team: • choose whether they are in or out during malfunction tasks and submit dice as normal. passing during a malfunction task still lets the infected player take up to 2 dice from the available dice space. • no longer draw task cards at the end of their turn. • are not affected by the command outpost token (when passing, they always retrieve 2 dice). • cannot participate in votes. • cannot be voted on or be quarantined. • cannot use their character ability or become fatigued. • cannot become the commander. • no longer have access to the normal actions, but instead gain access to the following 5 new actions: interference draw 3 task cards. discard as many as you want and return the rest to the top of the task deck in any order you choose. energy spike if there are 0-1 shield tokens on the board, add 1 shield token and, if applicable, test the shields. if there are 2 or more shield tokens on the board, test the shields. test the shields. roll a die: if the roll matches the current failure condition on the shield track, the active player chooses to draw a fatigue token or draw an outpost token. sabotage place the sabotage token on top of the shield control, outpost status, or life support label on the board. any player attempting to repair that area rolls and submits a die normally. afterward, whether they succeeded or not, they must also discard 2 dice to the board to remove the sabotage token. if they do not have 2 dice, they discard as many as they can. a player attempting to repair a sabotaged area will spend up to 3 dice: 1 for the repair attempt and 2 for the sabotage token. an infected player may execute this action to move the sabotage token from one area of the board to another, but there may only ever be 1 sabotaged area at any given time. test commander the commander must roll all of his active dice and submit 1. if positive, the commander is successful and nothing happens. if negative, the commander fails and the infected player may draw a damage token of their choice. if the commander has no active dice, it is an automatic failure.demoralize all uninfected players, beginning with the first to the infected player’s left, must replace all of their active black strong dice with red weak dice until there are no more red weak dice in the available resources space. additional rules dice unless otherwise stated, dice rolls are always private, and a player never reveals what they roll. the only dice seen publicly are the ones that a player (infected or uninfected) submits. the number of active dice, and what kinds of dice they are, that a player has behind their screen is also private. players may share this information, but they may also lie. if a player (infected or uninfected) chooses to roll their dice, they must roll all the active dice available to them (unless the action calls for a specific number of dice). die limits if a player’s die limit is reduced and they have more active dice behind their screen than their new die limit allows, they must immediately discard any excess dice to the available resources space (their choice). if the commander role goes to another player, the previous commander immediately places the commander die on the available resources space. when a player’s die limit is increased, they do not immediately retrieve their new dice (including the commander die if a player has just received the commander card). a player always has a die limit of at least 1. if a player’s die limit is reduced to 0 or less, that player may still retrieve and hold at least 1 die behind their screen. changing commanders if the commander is ever quarantined, the commander card passes to the player who initiated the vote. however, if the player who initiated the vote is in quarantine themselves (or if the commander initiated the vote), the role passes to the first uninfected player to the commander’s left. if the commander reveals as infected, the role passes to the first uninfected player to the commander’s left. if all infected players reveal if at any point in the game all infected players have revealed themselves, remove the suspicion cube from the game and ignore !!!suspicious activity!!! on task cards. how to win uninfected victory the uninfected team wins if they successfully complete 3 events and the final event. infected victory the infected team wins immediately if any one of these conditions is met before the uninfected team completes the final event: 1. all 6 shield tokens are on the board. 2. all 6 outpost tokens are on the board. 3. all 6 fatigue tokens are on the board. active player’s turn 1. retrieve dice retrieve dice from the available resource space to meet your die limit. the commander may also retrieve the commander die. 2. perform an action perform 1 action not blocked with an outpost token. repair choose 1 repair action. roll up to 3 of your dice and submit 1. + die = the action succeeds, remove 1 appropriate token. - die = the action fails. call a vote call a vote to either quarantine a player or release a player from quarantine (even yourself). all players hold out a closed fist and simultaneously reveal. = vote that the player is uninfected. = vote that the player is infected. empty hand = abstain. majority vote uninfected = the player is released from quarantine or remains free from quarantine. majority vote infected = the player is placed in quarantine or remains in quarantine. commander breaks ties. the die goes back behind your screen. lone wolf try to add an event cube to the current event by yourself. roll up to 3 of your dice and submit 2. both dice positive = the action succeeds. add an event cube. if the event is then completed, the commander immediately draws 2 new event cards and chooses 1. issue order choose another player and issue an order to them. this costs no dice. the ordered player is under no obligation to comply. the ordered player may retrieve 2 dice (do not exceed die limit) or perform any 2 normal actions (neither may be issue order). they may not use their character ability. if the ordered player’s first action is reveal as infected, they may immediately perform an infected action. reveal as infected a player with an infected status card may reveal it and publicly switch to the infected team. 3. choose a task card draws 2 task cards and place 1 on the current task space.discard the other facedown. 4. resolve task malfunction tasks place the blue difficulty cube on the difficulty number on the difficulty track, and the black success cube on 0. starting with the active player and going clockwise, each player flips their participation token to in or out.out = take up to 2 dice from the available resources space (do not exceed die limit). in = starting with the active player and going clockwise, roll at least 1 die and submit at least 1 die. reroll as many times as you choose, but every time you roll you must submit at least 1. every time a die is submitted, move the success cube up or down on the track the appropriate number. if the final result is equal to or higher than the difficulty number, the task is successful. if the result is lower, the task fails and the consequence on the card occurs. outpost malfunction randomly draw and place outpost tokens on the outpost status section equal to the red consequence number. shield control: no repair shield actions. life support: no repair life support actions.research lab: no call vote actions (except forced votes).communications: no issue order actions.hangar bay: no lone wolf actions.command: 1 fewer die when passing on a malfunction task. life support malfunction place fatigue tokens on the life support section equal to the red consequence number. a character in play on the token becomes fatigued. shield malfunction place shield tokens equal to the red consequence number on the shield track. the shield must then be tested. roll any die: if the result matches the current failure condition, choose to draw a fatigue token or draw an outpost token. ?????????? malfunction the active player must choose an outpost, life support, or shield malfunction before players choose to participate. complication tasks player(s) must make a choice. if they succeed, the task is successful. if they fail, the consequence on the card occurs. 5. add an event cube if the task was successful, add a blue event cube on the next empty spot on the current event card. 6. complete the event if the last event cube was added to an event card, that event is completed. execute any event text. 7. select a new event if an event was successfully completed, the commander draws 2 new event cards and chooses 1. if it was the 3rd completed event, immediately proceed to the final event instead. 8. advance suspicion cube if the task card said !!!suspicious activity!!! move the red suspicion cube 1 space forward on the suspicion track. 9. hold a vote if the suspicion cube is on the final space on the track, choose a player to vote on (even yourself or a quarantined player). afterwards reset the suspicion cube. active player’s turn 1. retrieve dice retrieve dice from the available resource space to meet your die limit. the commander may also retrieve the commander die. 2. perform an action perform 1 action not blocked with an outpost token. repair choose 1 repair action. roll up to 3 of your dice and submit 1. + die = the action succeeds, remove 1 appropriate token. - die = the action fails. call a vote call a vote to either quarantine a player or release a player from quarantine (even yourself). all players hold out a closed fist and simultaneously reveal. = vote that the player is uninfected. = vote that the player is infected. empty hand = abstain. majority vote uninfected = the player is released from quarantine or remains free from quarantine. majority vote infected = the player is placed in quarantine or remains in quarantine. commander breaks ties. the die goes back behind your screen. lone wolf try to add an event cube to the current event by yourself. roll up to 3 of your dice and submit 2. both dice positive = the action succeeds. add an event cube. if the event is then completed, the commander immediately draws 2 new event cards and chooses 1. issue order choose another player and issue an order to them. this costs no dice. the ordered player is under no obligation to comply. the ordered player may retrieve 2 dice (do not exceed die limit) or perform any 2 normal actions (neither may be issue order). they may not use their character ability. if the ordered player’s first action is reveal as infected, they may immediately perform an infected action. reveal as infected a player with an infected status card may reveal it and publicly switch to the infected team. 3. choose a task card draws 2 task cards and place 1 on the current task space.discard the other facedown. 4. resolve task malfunction tasks place the blue difficulty cube on the difficulty number on the difficulty track, and the black success cube on 0. starting with the active player and going clockwise, each player flips their participation token to in or out.out = take up to 2 dice from the available resources space (do not exceed die limit). in = starting with the active player and going clockwise, roll at least 1 die and submit at least 1 die. reroll as many times as you choose, but every time you roll you must submit at least 1. every time a die is submitted, move the success cube up or down on the track the appropriate number. if the final result is equal to or higher than the difficulty number, the task is successful. if the result is lower, the task fails and the consequence on the card occurs. outpost malfunction randomly draw and place outpost tokens on the outpost status section equal to the red consequence number. shield control: no repair shield actions. life support: no repair life support actions.research lab: no call vote actions (except forced votes).communications: no issue order actions.hangar bay: no lone wolf actions.command: 1 fewer die when passing on a malfunction task. life support malfunction place fatigue tokens on the life support section equal to the red consequence number. a character in play on the token becomes fatigued. shield malfunction place shield tokens equal to the red consequence number on the shield track. the shield must then be tested. roll any die: if the result matches the current failure condition, choose to draw a fatigue token or draw an outpost token. ?????????? malfunction the active player must choose an outpost, life support, or shield malfunction before players choose to participate. complication tasks player(s) must make a choice. if they succeed, the task is successful. if they fail, the consequence on the card occurs. 5. add an event cube if the task was successful, add a blue event cube on the next empty spot on the current event card. 6. complete the event if the last event cube was added to an event card, that event is completed. execute any event text. 7. select a new event if an event was successfully completed, the commander draws 2 new event cards and chooses 1. if it was the 3rd completed event, immediately proceed to the final event instead. 8. advance suspicion cube if the task card said !!!suspicious activity!!! move the red suspicion cube 1 space forward on the suspicion track. 9. hold a vote if the suspicion cube is on the final space on the track, choose a player to vote on (even yourself or a quarantined player). afterwards reset the suspicion cube. final event when the final event begins, take all remaining and discarded task cards, remove all complication tasks, and shuffle and form a new malfunction-only task deck. quarantine place a quarantine token on your screen to indicate your die limit is now reduced by 2 dice. on your turn: you may not use the actions repair or lone wolf. you do not draw task cards at the end of your turn. a quarantined commander loses the commander card to the player who called the vote. fatigue a fatigued character flips their character

shield tokens on the board, test the shields. check the result against the current failure condition. if it matches, draw a fatigue token or draw an outpost token. sabotage place the sabotage token on top of the shield control, outpost status, or life support label. after a player makes a repair attempt, successful or not, that player must also discard 2 dice to remove the sabotage token. if they do not have 2 dice, discard as many as they can. you may execute this action to move the token to another area. there may only ever be 1 sabotaged area at a time. test commander the commander must roll all of his active dice and submit 1. + die = the commander is successful and nothing happens. - die = the commander fails and the infected player may | draw a damage token of their choice. if the commander has no active dice, it is an automatic failure. demoralize all uninfected players, beginning with the first to the infected player’s left, must replace all of their active black dice with red dice until there are no more red dice in the available resources space. how to win uninfected victory the uninfected team wins if they successfully complete 3 events and the final event. infected

roll all of his active dice and submit 1. + die = the commander is successful and nothing happens. - die = the commander fails and the infected player may | draw a damage token of their choice. if the commander has no active dice, it is an automatic failure. demoralize all uninfected players, beginning with the first to the infected player’s left, must replace all of their active black dice with red dice until there are no more red dice in the available resources space. how to win uninfected victory the uninfected team wins if they successfully complete 3 events and the final event. infected victory the infected team wins the immediately if any one of these conditions is met before the uninfected team completes the final event: 1. all 6 shield tokens are on the board. 2. all 6 outpost tokens are on the board. 3. all 6 fatigue tokens are on the board. setup add the new character, final event cards, event, and infected status cards to their respective decks. add the new outpost token to the pool of outpost tokens. replace the original task decks with the new task decks. each player takes a player aid card. place 2 shield tokens on the first 2 spots of the shield track and the remaining 4 in a pile. place the sabotage, die, quarantine and amputation tokens, and the corporation dice, next to the board. randomly draw and place 2 outpost tokens on the appropriate spots on the outpost status panel (their effects apply immediately). place the rest in a facedown pile. place the red suspicion cube at the beginning of the vote track, a single blue and black cube above the difficulty track, and the remaining blue event cubes next to the board. shuffle the character cards and deal 1 faceup to each player. each player takes the matching uninfected player screen and 2 black strong dice, 2 red weak dice, and a participation token. build the fatigue pool by adding a fatigue token matching each character in play (except david) to the pool. if necessary, add any additional fatigue tokens so that the pool has a total of 6 tokens. randomly draw fatigue tokens until you draw one that matches a character in play. that character is the starting commander and takes the commander card, the blue commander die, and the commander die token. build the evacuation pool by adding an evacuation clearance token matching each character to the pool. randomly draw (or players can choose) a final event card and place it faceup on the camera 4 space on the board. place the other final event cards back in the box. place the evacuation vote board underneath the suspicious activity section of the board and place the blue evacuation cube on the first spot on the track. beneath it, place the evacuation clearance board, refueling – not ready for takeoff side faceup. determine how many uninfected and infected status cards and which deck of task cards to use: 3 players: 1 infected, 2 uninfected, silver tasks (remove the voluntary blood testing card). 4 players: 1 infected, 3 uninfected, black tasks (remove the voluntary blood testing card). 5 players: 2 infected, 3 uninfected, silver tasks. 6 players: 2 infected, 4 uninfected, black tasks. 7 players: 3 infected, 4 uninfected, silver tasks. shuffle the infected status cards, randomly select the number required, and place them facedown. place any unused infected status cards back in the box without looking at them. form the status deck by shuffling the selected infected status cards with the required number of ininfected status cards. deal 1 status card to each player, facedown. one player gives a steady count to 10, while all players silently read their status cards. they must not put them down until the count is completed. shuffle the appropriate task deck and shuffle the event deck and place both decks next to the board. the commander draws 2 event cards, choosing 1 to place faceup on the board on the camera 1 spot, and the other to go to the bottom of the event deck (no other player should see this discarded card). the player to the left of the commander is the starting player and play proceeds clockwise. give them the active player token. place the refueling card in front of the starting player. submitted dice go to the spent resources space. after an action or task has been resolved, submitted dice are moved from the spent resources space to the available resources space.game turn 1. retrieve dice skip this step at the start of the game. the active player retrieves as many dice from the available resources space as needed to meet their die limit. you may choose any combination of red weak or black strong dice. only the commander may retrieve the commander die (this die does not count towards the commander’s die limit). 2. perform an action the active player may perform 1 of the following actions. after each player’ turn, pass the active player token to the next player. players cannot perform actions that have been blocked with an outpost token. repair choose 1 of the following repair actions. roll up to 3 (or fewer) of your dice and submit 1. if the die you submit is positive, the action is successful. if the die is negative, the action fails. repair shield if there are shield tokens on the board. if successful, remove the shield token farthest on the shield dial. repair life support if players have become fatigued. if successful, any 1 fatigue token on the board may be shuffled back into the pile of fatigue tokens. you do not have to declare which token you intend to remove before making the attempt. repair outpost if an action has been blocked with an outpost token. if successful, any 1 outpost token on the board may be shuffled back into the pile of outpost tokens. that action is now available for players to use. you do not have to declare which token you intend to remove before making the attempt. this is the only action that is always available to players, no matter which stations have been damaged. call a vote call a vote to either quarantine a player or release a player from quarantine (you may call a vote on yourself). all players then hold out a closed fist and simultaneously reveal. a black strong die is a vote that the player is uninfected and should not be in quarantine. a red weak die is a vote that the player is infected and should be in quarantine. an empty hand means the player has abstained from the vote. the commander die may not be used to cast a vote. you may have to abstain if you have no active dice or do not have the color of die you want to vote with. you may also willingly abstain, even if you have dice you could vote with. if the majority vote uninfected, the player is either released from quarantine or remains free from quarantine. if the majority vote infected, the player is either placed in quarantine or remains in there. on a tie, the commander breaks the tie however they wish. after the vote, players place any dice they used in the vote behind their player screen with their other active dice. vote for amputation you may choose to call an amputation vote on another player. a red weak die is a vote to amputate. a black strong die is a vote to not amputate. the commander breaks ties as usual. if the vote is successful, the character’s arm is cut off and they receive an amputation token which permanently reduces their die limit by 1. this is permanent, even if they reveal themselves to be infected. a revealed infected player with an amputation token will only ever have a die limit of 1. you can call an amputation vote on a quarantined player, but you cannot call one on a revealed infected player. a player can only ever receive 1 amputation token. vote for clearance choose a player to vote on. every red weak die is a vote to deny them clearance or revoke their clearance if they’ve been previously cleared to evacuate. every black strong die is a vote to clear them for evacuation or maintain their clearance if they’ve been previously cleared to evacuate. the commander breaks ties. if the vote is successful and the player has not already been cleared, place their evacuation clearance token on the evacuation clearance board. if the vote fails and the player already had their token on the board, place it back in the evacuation pool. if the evacuation clearance board is full (3 players: 1 evacuation clearance token; 4 or 5 players: 2 tokens; 6 or 7 players: 3 tokens), you can only call a clearance vote on a player that already has their evacuation clearance token on the board. you cannot call a clearance vote on a player in quarantine. if a player already cleared to evacuate is later quarantined, return their evacuation clearance token to the evacuation pool. vote to take off if the evacuation clearance board has filled, you may call a vote for the evacuation ship to take off. a black strong die is a vote to take off. a red weak die is a vote to not take off. if the vote is successful, the ship takes off carrying only the characters with clearance and the game immediately ends. lone wolf the active player may attempt to add an event cube to the current event by themselves. roll up to 3 of your dice and submit 2. if both submitted dice are positive, the action succeeds and an event cube is added to the current event or final event card. if the event is then completed, the commander immediately draws 2 new event cards and chooses 1 before the active player’s turn continues. if the final event is completed, the uninfected team immediately wins the game. issue order the active player may choose another player and issue an order to them. this costs no dice, but the ordered player is under no obligation to follow the instructions. the ordered player may either retrieve 2 spent dice (observing their die limit) or perform any 2 actions they would normally be able to perform (neither of those actions may be issue order). if upon receiving an order, a player’s first action is reveal as infected, they may immediately perform an infected action. a player given an order may not use their character ability while performing actions (as they are not currently the active player). reveal as infected a player with an infected status card may reveal it and publicly switch to the infected team. 3. choose a task card the active player draws 2 task cards and chooses 1 to play faceup on the current task space. the other card is discarded facedown to the discard space. if there are no cards to draw, take all discarded cards, shuffle them, and create a new task deck (do not reveal the task cards in the facedown discard pile). after the active player has chosen a task card, they must secretly roll 2 of the yellow corporation dice and publicly submit one. if the number is negative, shift the black success cube backwards on the track (discard the second die without anyone seeing it). 4. resolve task malfunction tasks malfunction tasks require players to collectively roll their dice in an attempt to fix the malfunction (or, in the case of the infected players, possibly cause everyone to fail). place the blue difficulty cube on the appropriate number on the difficulty track, and the black success cube on 0. starting with the active player and going clockwise, each player and infected player flips their participation token to the in or out side. if a player or infected player is out, they immediately take up to 2 dice from the available resources space (without exceeding their die limit). each player or infected player who is in, starting with the active player and going clockwise, rolls and submits dice. no one may roll dice and see their results until it is their turn to submit dice. all players and infected players who are participating in the task must roll and submit at least 1 die. players and infected players may reroll their dice as many times as they choose. however, every time you roll your dice you must submit at least 1 of those dice (and may submit more than 1); even if the outcome of the malfunction appears inevitable. every time a die is submitted, move the black success cube up or down on the difficulty track the appropriate number. each positive die submitted counts toward success; each negative die toward failure. the numbers shown on the track are not limits. place submitted dice on the spent resources space on the board. after the task has been resolved (but before consequences occur or event cubes are added) move all dice from the spent resources space to the available resources space. once all participating players and infected players have rolled and submitted at least 1 die each, if the final result is equal to or higher than the difficulty number, the task is successful. if the result is lower than the difficulty number, the task fails and the consequence listed on the malfunction card occurs. outpost malfunction randomly draw and place a number of outpost tokens on the outpost status section equal to the red consequence number. if the sixth outpost token is placed, the infected team immediately wins. each outpost token prevents the players from taking certain actions until the station is repaired: shield control: repair shield actions may not be used. life support: repair life support actions may not be used. research lab: call vote actions may not be used (this does not apply to forced votes that occur when the suspicion cube reaches the end of the suspicion track). communications: issue order actions may not be used. hangar bay: lone wolf actions may not be used.command: players retrieve 1 fewer die when passing on a malfunction task (this does not affect the number of dice players retrieve at the beginning of their turn, nor does it affect a player who is issued an order and chooses to retrieve dice). life support malfunction randomly draw and place a number of fatigue tokens on the life support section equal to the red consequence number. if the sixth fatigue token is placed, the infected team immediately wins. if the character on the token is in play, that character becomes fatigued. if the character is not in play, the token still counts toward the infected team’s win condition. shield malfunction place a number of shield tokens equal to the red consequence number on the next available spots on the shield track. if the sixth shield token is placed, the infected team immediately wins. after placing the tokens test the shields. check the current failure condition (-1, any +, -2, or any -). roll any die available (the color of the die does not matter). if the result matches the failure condition, the shield test has failed and the active player must choose to either draw a fatigue token or draw an outpost token.?????????? malfunction the active player may choose which malfunction occurs: outpost, life support, or shield. the choice must be made before players and infected players choose to participate and roll dice. complication tasks complication tasks feature an illustration and require the player(s) to make a choice. if they succeed, the task is successful. if they fail, the consequence on the card occurs. 5. add an event cube (conditional) if the task was successful, add a blue event cube on the next available empty spot, either on the current event or final event card. players cannot place event cubes on the final event card until the 3 previous events have been completed (with the exception of when the tactical prep event card is completed). 6. complete the event (conditional) if the last event cube was added to an event card, that event is completed. execute the event text on the card if applicable. if the completed event was the final event, the uninfected team wins the game. if the event card, when completed, calls for damage tokens to be added, add them until just before doing so would cause the game to end in an infected victory. however if a final event card calls for adding damage tokens and doing so would cause the game to end in an infected victory, the infected team wins. 7. select a new event (conditional) if an event was successfully completed, the commander draws 2 more event cards, placing 1 faceup on the board in the next spot and discarding the second facedown. if it was the 3rd completed event, players immediately proceed to the final event and the commander does not draw any cards. 8. advance suspicion cube (conditional) if the task card said !!!suspicious activity!!! move the red suspicion cube 1 space forward on the suspicion track, regardless of whether the task succeeded or failed. 9. hold a vote (conditional) if the suspicion cube has reached the final space on the suspicion track, a vote must now be called. even the research lab outpost token on the board does not prevent this mandatory vote from occurring. the active player must choose a player to vote on (you may choose yourself or a quarantined player). after the vote, reset the suspicion cube on the track. play then proceeds clockwise to the next player, who takes the active player token. events and final events event text on events takes place at the following times: at start: one time effect; takes place as soon as the event is played. during: persistent effect; takes place as long as the event is the current event. upon completion: one time effect; takes place as soon as the event is completed. when the final event begins, take all remaining and discarded task cards and remove all complication tasks and place them back in the box (they will no longer be used). add the evacuation failure card that matches the task deck you’re using (silver or black). shuffle and form a new malfunction-only task deck with the remaining cards. do not reveal the task cards in the facedown discard pile, as this could unfairly reveal how players have acted when choosing tasks. the player who draws the evacuation failure card must immediately reveal it. discard the evacuation clearance and evacuation vote boards during the final event, as well as any clearance tokens. players may no longer call clearance or take off votes, and ignore !!!evacuate evacuate!!! on task cards. quarantine when a player is placed in quarantine, place a quarantine token in front of their player screen, covering up 2 of their die icons: their die limit is now reduced by 2 dice. if they have more active dice behind their screen than their current die limit allows, they must discard the extra dice to the available resources space. on a quarantined player’s turn: • retrieve dice up to your die limit as usual. • you may only use the actions call vote, issue order, and reveal as infected. if call vote and issue order have been blocked by outpost tokens and you are not infected, then you have no available actions. • you do not draw task cards at the end of your turn. quarantined players may still participate in votes and tasks. if released, they discard their quarantine token and their die limit is increased by 2 dice (do not automatically retrieve those dice). players always have access to at least 1 die, even if being quarantined would reduce their die limit to 0 or fewer dice. a commander who is successfully quarantined loses the commander card to the player who called the vote. if the player who called the vote is in quarantine themselves (or if the commander called the vote on themselves), the commander card passes to the first player to the left who is not in quarantine. if all players who are not revealed as infected end up in quarantine, the last player to be quarantined retains the commander card. the first player to be released from quarantine immediately becomes the commander. fatigue when a fatigue token is drawn, if it matches a character in play, that player must flip their character card, can no longer use their character’s special ability, and may only submit 1 die during a malfunction task. if the fatigue token is removed due to a successful repair life support action, the player flips their character card back over and plays as normal. testing the shield any time shield tokens are drawn, the active player always rolls a die to test the shields. place all shield tokens on the board in the next available spots on the shield track before rolling the die. if the roll matches the current failure condition on the shield track (the first symbol visible after the last token on the track: -1, any +, -2, or any -), the active player chooses to either draw a fatigue token or draw an outpost token. revealing as infected if you reveal as infected: • if not quarantined, execute the infection power on your status card immediately. • roll any available die; if the result is positive, you may execute your infection power a second time. • discard your character card, quarantine token (if quarantined), any die tokens, and your uninfected player screen. if you were the commander, pass the commander card to the first uninfected player to the left and place the commander die in the available resources space.• take an infected player screen. observing your new die limit, discard down to 2 dice, returning any extra dice to the available resources space. • your turn is immediately over (unless you revealed as a result of the issue order action and revealing was your first action; in which case you may immediately perform an infected action). players who have openly declared for the infected team: • choose whether they are in or out during malfunction tasks and submit dice as normal. passing during a malfunction task still lets the infected player take up to 2 dice from the available dice space. • no longer draw task cards at the end of their turn. • are not affected by the command outpost token (when passing, they always retrieve 2 dice). • cannot participate in votes. • cannot be voted on or be quarantined. • cannot use their character ability or become fatigued. • cannot become the commander. • no longer have access to the normal actions, but instead gain access to the following 5 new actions: interference draw 3 task cards. discard as many as you want and return the rest to the top of the task deck in any order you choose. energy spike if there are 0-1 shield tokens on the board, add 1 shield token and, if there are 2 or more tokens on the board, test the shields. test the shields. roll a die: if the roll matches the current failure condition on the shield track, the active player chooses to draw a fatigue token or draw an outpost token. sabotage place the sabotage token on top of the shield control, outpost status, or life support label on the board. any player attempting to repair that area rolls and submits a die normally. afterward, whether they succeeded or not, they must also discard 2 dice to the board to remove the sabotage token. if they do not have 2 dice, they discard as many as they can. a player attempting to repair a sabotaged area will spend up to 3 dice: 1 for the repair attempt and 2 for the sabotage token. an infected player may execute this action to move the sabotage token from one area of the board to another, but there may only ever be 1 sabotaged area at any given time. test commander the commander must roll all of his active dice and submit 1. if positive, the commander is successful and nothing happens. if negative, the commander fails and the infected player may draw a damage token of their choice. if the commander has no active dice, it is an automatic failure. demoralize all uninfected players, beginning with the first to the infected player’s left, must replace all of their active black strong dice with red weak dice until there are no more red weak dice in the available resources space. evacuation if the evacuation ship takes off, the game immediately ends. one at a time, check the status cards of all the players who were cleared for evacuation and left with the ship. if all players are uninfected, the uninfected team wins. if only a single infected player made it onto the ship, the infected team wins.refueling during the first full round of the game, the evacuation ship cannot take off, even if the full complement of players have been given clearance. indicate this by placing the refueling card in front of the start player and the evacuation clearance board on its refueling – not ready for takeoff side. when every player has had one turn and the active player token has returned to the initial start player, discard the refueling card and flip the evacuation clearance board to its fueling complete – ready for takeoff side. place any evacuation clearance tokens already on the board back on the board after flipping it. players may now call a take off vote as an action. forced clearance and take off votes whenever an !!!evacuate evacuate!!! task card is played, move the evacuation cube 1 space forward on the evacuation vote track, regardless of whether the task succeeded or failed. when the cube reaches the last space, the active player must call either a clearance vote or (if ship is ready for takeoff) a take off vote at the end of the turn. if a forced quarantine and clearance/take off vote both occur on the same turn, the active player chooses the order of voting. additional rules dice unless otherwise stated, dice rolls are always private, and a player never reveals what they roll. the only dice seen publicly are the ones that a player (infected or uninfected) submits. the number of active dice, and what kinds of dice they are, that a player has behind their screen is also private. players may share this information, but they may also lie. if a player (infected or uninfected) chooses to roll their dice, they must roll all the active dice available to them (unless the action calls for a specific number of dice). die limits if a player’s die limit is reduced and they have more active dice behind their screen than their new die limit allows, they must immediately discard any excess dice to the available resources space (their choice). if the commander role goes to another player, the previous commander immediately places the commander die on the available resources space. when a player’s die limit is increased, they do not immediately retrieve their new dice (including the commander die if a player has just received the commander card). a player always has a die limit of at least 1. if a player’s die limit is reduced to 0 or less, that player may still retrieve and hold at least 1 die behind their screen. changing commanders if the commander is ever quarantined, the commander card passes to the player who initiated the vote. however, if the player who initiated the vote is in quarantine themselves (or if the commander initiated the vote), the role passes to the first uninfected player to the commander’s left. if the commander reveals as infected, the role passes to the first uninfected player to the commander’s left. if all infected players reveal if at any point all infected players have revealed themselves, remove the suspicion cube from the game and ignore !!!suspicious activity!!! on task cards. how to win uninfected victory the uninfected team wins if they successfully complete 3 events and the final event. infected victory the infected team wins immediately if any one of these conditions is met before the uninfected team completes the final event: 1. all 6 shield tokens are on the board. 2. all 6 outpost tokens are on the board. 3. all 6 fatigue tokens are on the board (even if there are 7 players and david is not one of the characters in play, and therefore there are 7 tokens).

78,31,DARK WORLD,1992,WADDINGTONS GAMES,1.9107,56,"setup setup the board. one player is the korak the cobran and the others are the heroes (playing 1-4 heroes each, depending on the number of hero players). each hero player takes a hero, a basic weapon, a base camp, and 3 hit/miss cards dealt from the shuffled hit/miss deck (placed the deck facedown near the board). hero figures start on the castle entrance space in any order. set their bases to 8 hit points (hp). the korak figure is placed on the castle throne. korak hides one golden weapon in each chest and places the chests in 4 different rooms (not in front or behind a door or secret door). the monsters and magic items are placed behind the castle. the gold coins (numbers facedown) are placed in the castle pit behind the fortress. the haunter is placed near the board, near the castle rooms. playing the game the heroes go first. the mace of chaos is shaken by korak at the start of each round: the order of the colored balls, from bottom to top, is the hero turn order. hero turn a hero’s turn consists of 3 actions. an action is a move of 1 square to an adjacent square (diagonals are not allowed), or 1 bout of combat (in any order). korak’s turn after all the heroes have had a turn, korak may take 3 actions (any combination of moves and combat) with each of his visible monsters (one that has been placed in a room after the door has been opened by a hero). he may also summon the haunter once, if he wishes.movement movement in rooms when a hero reaches a closed door, he must open it (this does not count as an action). after korak has placed monsters in the room, the hero may continue if he has movement remaining. open doors (not secret doors) remain open for the rest of the game. a hero may walk through squares containing other heroes, but may not stop on the same square. a hero may never walk through a monster’s square. a monster may walk through squares containing other monsters, but may not stop on the same square. a monster may never walk through a hero’s square. placing monsters when a room door is opened by a hero, korak must immediately decide which monsters to put in the room. there is a maximum limit of monster hp for each of the rooms: rooms 1-2: up to 3 hp per room. rooms 3-5: up to 4 hp per room.rooms 6-8: up to 5 hp per room. at least 1 monster, but no more than 2, must be in each room. every monster placed must have a magic item on their base. monsters may not be placed on the square in front of the open door (but may move onto it on their turn). combat opponents must be on adjacent (non-diagonal) squares. a hero or monster may attack more than one opponent in a turn (one at a time) if he has actions to do so. a bout of combat is an attempted blow by the attacker, followed by a return blow from his opponent if it survives. at the end of the bout, the hero may continue with another bout, or move away if he has actions left. hero’s attack a hero rolls 2 dice (3 dice if he has a golden weapon). a die result may be 0, 1, or 2 hp damage. he may then decide whether or not to use a hit card. finally he checks the base of the monster to find its hit strength. if the dice roll (and cards used) are the same or greater than the hit strength, the monster is dead. the hero takes the monster, its magic item (or leave it on the dead monster’s square if you don’t need it), a gold coin (draw randomly without looking at the value) and a new hit/miss card, and places them all in his base camp. if the dice roll (and cards used) are less than the hit strength, the monster is unaffected. korak’s attack korak rolls 2 dice for the monster. the hero records hits on his base. if he has 0 or less hp left he is knocked unconscious and goes back to the castle entrance. hit/miss cards when a hero takes a hit from the warlord’s dice roll, he may reduce the damage by 1 for every miss card played; to a maximum of 2 per bout. miss cards are only used to reduce the monster’s blows. after rolling dice and before looking at the monster’s base, a player may use hit cards to increase the damage and kill it; to a maximum of 3 per bout. used cards are returned to the bottom of the deck. the haunter korak rolls the 10 sided die: the number rolled indicates the row that the haunter flies across, killing or knocking unconscious all in its path. if a 0 is rolled, the haunter does not appear.any monster hit is removed from play and placed back in the castle pit. the magic item it was guarding is left on the square where it died. once the first hero reaches the doomstep, the haunter can no longer be activated.castle entrance & knocked unconscious the haunter may not harm anyone in the castle entrance. no monster may enter the entrance. when a hero is knocked unconscious, on his next turn he is restored to 1 hp and may now take a normal turn. if he has a magic potion he may use it and then step onto, and stop, on the teleport platform. or he may go to the healing fountain. his turn now ends. using the healing fountain costs 1 turn and restores all of a hero’s hp. more than one hero may use the fountain at the same time. stepping onto the teleport platform costs 1 turn and does not count as an action. the hero may immediately teleport to any square up to the front of the last open door, following the order of the rooms and not skipping any which have been bypassed due to the use of secret doors. you cannot teleport to an occupied square; land on the nearest free square behind it. secret doors to use a secret door, a hero must stop on the secret door square and roll the 10 sided die. to find the door, you must roll one of the numbers printed on the secret door square: in room 1: you must roll a 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. in room 4: you must roll a 1, 2 or 3. if you fail, any more normal movement you had that turn is lost and you must move one adjacent square away. if the door is found, revolve it and move the hero into the new room. rolling the dice and moving into the room does not count as an action. when a secret door is turned, and a monster, hero, or magic item is on the square on the other side, the door opener and the monster, hero, or magic item swap places. monsters cannot activate secret doors, nor stand on the numbered secret door squares.treasure and magic items monsters and heroes may never stand on treasure chest squares. once all monsters in a room are dead, a hero may open a chest by standing in the square directly in front of it. he may take the golden weapon and replace it with his basic weapon. magic items a hero may have up to 2 magic items at a time. using a magic item does not count as an action. all magic items are used once, anytime in a hero’s turn (never the korak’s turn), and then discarded into the castle pit. any magic item left in a square may be picked up by any hero moving onto that square, if the square is unoccupied. healing potion: restores a hero’s hp to full strength. it may not be used if a hero is already at 8 hp. speed boots: the hero takes one extra turn of 3 actions (added to any part of the current turn he might still have left). fireball grenade: the grenade can be thrown at a monster 2 squares away in a straight line. it does 3 hp damage to the target square, and 2 hp damage to each adjacent square (not through walls). hit cards can be used to increase the effect. it cannot be thrown at a hero, but heroes suffer 2 damage if adjacent to the hit monster. any monster slain leaves its magic item on the square where it died. the arch and doomstep once a hero passes through the arch and into the battle arena, there is no going back. monsters from the castle rooms may not pass through the arch, not may arena monsters enter rooms. arena monsters may not step on the doomstep (the space beyond the arch), not fight any hero standing on it. a hero may not fight a monster while standing on the doomstep. the first hero to reach the doomstep takes 4 hit/miss cards; the second hero takes 3 cards, and the third and fourth each take 2 cards.the castle arena korak never leaves his throne. the remaining monsters (up to a maximum of 6) are brought into play in the first korak turn after the first hero arrives on the doomstep. they are placed on squares at the lower level in front of korak, or under the castle (one monster per door). each, other than korak, gets a magic item in its base. in combat, the next stair, up or down, is an adjacent square. any hero knocked unconscious by any monsters (other than korak) goes back to the doomstep and must lose from his base camp one of the following: a magic item, a hit/miss card, a gold coin, or a slain monster figure. if you have none of these you lose nothing. next round you recover 1 hp and continue play. korak always rolls 3 dice when he fights a hero. korak is fought from the area in front of his throne, which can accommodate all the heroes at the same time. monsters may not enter this area. korak has 7 hp. if he is killed, the game ends; his figure is taken by the victorious hero and that hero is placed on korak’s throne. any hero knocked unconscious by korak is out of the game. winning if all 4 heroes are eliminated by korak, the korak player wins. if korak is killed, the game ends immediately and heroes count up their points as follows: – each monster in your base camp is worth its number of hp. – each gold coin is worth its value. – each unused hit/miss card is worth 1 point. – standing on the throne is worth 5 points. the winner is the hero with the most points (not necessarily the hero who killed korak). for a more challenging game: 1. heroes may never keep more than 6 hit/miss cards at a time. 2. to kill a monster in combat, heroes must get at least 1 hp more than the monster’s strength."

fatigue he spends. ronan of the wild pico adds a black power die when the campaign is copper level, growing to a silver die when at silver level, and a gold die when at gold level. runewitch astarra only activates glyphs within 3 spaces.ispher and red scorpion are instantly healed to full wounds whenever they return to the terrinoth map. 3. hero setup each hero player randomly draws 3 hero sheets and chooses 1. players may confer before choosing. there must be 4 heroes in the campaign. the hero party marker is placed on the terrinoth map on tamalir. one player is the party treasurer and begins with 1,200 coins for the party to buy their starting equipment. unspent coins stay in their treasury. each hero then takes: – skill cards in number and type (subterfuge, fighting and wizardry) as indicated on his hero sheet, plus 1 from a deck of choice. choose 1 card to keep and discard the rest back into their decks; – starting equipment and potions available in the city store for the prices indicated. 4. overlord setup the overlord player selects or randomly chooses an avatar sheet and places the overlord’s keep token on the map. the overlord then takes: – the sir alric farrow lieutenant card, placing his marker on the overlord’s keep; – 15 xp worth of avatar upgrades (white overlord upgrade cards and no additional lieutenants). these do not affect his conquest point total. any not spent are wasted; – his choice of plot. the flavour text on the zero-cost card associated with that plot is read aloud and the card is placed faceup on the table.the game week 1. time passes check the heroes’ and overlord’s combined conquest to see if the campaign level advances. the overlord gets 1 conquest token , plus 1 for each city he has razed. 2. resolve sieges remove all siege tokens from cities where there is not at least 1 overlord lieutenant. for each city that has a number of siege tokens on it equal to its defense rating, roll a black power die. on a the city is razed. if a city is razed, flip one of the tokens over to its razed side and remove the rest. the heroes can still move through the space, but the city no longer provides any services. if tamalir is razed, the overlord wins the campaign. 3. overlord actions the overlord may, in any order, issue orders to his lieutenants and purchase an upgrade. lieutenant orders each lieutenant may be issued 1 order— move or besiege—each game week. lieutenants move from their current location along one trail of any type, and do not check for encounters. they cannot enter legendary or secret master areas. if a lieutenant ends his movement in the same space as the party space he may attack. a lieutenant beginning his turn in a city may besiege it. place a siege token on the city. once its defense rating is reached, no more tokens are placed. upgrades the overlord may purchase 1 upgrade per game week with his xp. 4. party actions the party collectively chooses either the move action or the train action. move the party moves from their current location along one trail, cannot split up, and must check for an encounter. they cannot move along river trails without the magic boat, secret trails without kerak’s map, nor can they enter the overlord’s keep until the final battle. heroes may equip or exchange items and drink potions freely while on the overland map. if the party ends its movement in a space containing one or more lieutenants, they may choose to attack each of them (each resolved as a separate encounter). if the party ends its movement in a dungeon area, they receive 1 conquest token if they have not been there before, and may then enter the dungeon. if they end their movement in a city, they may each visit a building in that city (though not a training ground at the end of a move action). train if the heroes start their game week in a city they may each train at one of the buildings. 4. end of the week once all encounters and/or dungeons are completed, a new game week begins.encounters when a party travels along a trail using a move action, the overlord rolls a number of black dice equal to the number on the shield on the trail. if the shield is green, any blanks rolled indicate an encounter. if yellow, any rolled. if red, any power enhancements rolled. if an encounter occurs, the overlord shuffles the incident cards and draws until he draws one with a shield colour in the lower right matching the shield on the trail. non-combat encounters are read aloud and executed. comba t encounters when a combat encounter is drawn, the overlord shuffles the location cards and draws one. the map shown is assembled and any special rules noted. cards describe a named leader, minions, and a set of abilities, which can be activated with threat gained during this encounter. hero placement and ambushes the overlord rolls one black power die. if the roll matches any of the die faces shown in the lower left of the card, the encounter is an ambush. place the camp tile (the spaces have no special effects) in the center of the large starting map piece so the watch stump is oriented away from the 2 dead ends. the hero players choose 1 hero to be on watch and placed on the watch stump space; the others are placed on different bedroll spaces with a sleeping token each. if the encounter is not an ambush, each hero figure is placed in one of the dead end spaces on the starting tile. place the monsters anywhere but on the starting tile. the overlord reads the text of the incident card, including all abilities and special rules. the encounter is played out using the normal game rules. the overlord begins the encounter with 0 threat and no overlord cards. he receives 1 threat per hero per turn, in addition to the usual 1 threat for every 2 he spends when making successful attacks. threat may only be used to activate the encounter’s abilities as listed on the incident card, as well as these 2 abilities which each cost 2 threat: move a monster an extra space; or add a black power die to a monster’s attack roll or upgrade a power die by a step. the reinforce ability allows the overlord to place new monster(s) of the listed type next to one of the map exit spaces. the ability cannot be used if the leader in an encounter has been killed. hero los or abilities that affect spawning do not interfere with their placement. reinforcements are placed at the end of the overlord’s turn and moved onto the map on his next turn if they can move fully onto the map. victory, flight and death if all the monsters are killed, the party is victorious and rolls 4 black power dice, consults the encounter loot table, then continues their game week move action.if all the heroes are killed, the hero party marker is moved to tamalir and their game week action is over. if there are no heroes left but at least one fled, the party escapes. they get no loot but continue their week action. when the leader is killed, the heroes gain 100 coins and 2 conquest points. if a hero is killed, the overlord receives his conquest value in conquest tokens, and the hero is removed until the end of the encounter. a hero may flee by spending 1 mp while standing on an exit piece, but cannot return later in the encounter. party recovery at the end of every encounter, any heroes who were killed (or fled) rejoin the party. those killed return with full wounds, and all are restored to full fatigue. all lingering effect tokens are removed from all heroes except poison and curse. all heroes may drink any number of potions and use any healing items. encounters & lieutenant s when a lieutenant is involved, his card is used instead of an incident card, and the encounter is never an ambush. at the start of the encounter the overlord automatically puts into play, for free, the lieutenant’s power card; and if he has any treachery, may spend it on a hand of cards at normal costs. additionally, 2 cards without a treachery cost may be added for 1 treachery of the correct type (no power cards). cards may be played or discarded for threat as normal, but can only be played once. a lieutenant may battle and run as heroes do. he may also flee off the board as a hero can, which ends the encounter and moves him to the overlord’s keep. any quest item he was carrying is left behind for the heroes. a lieutenant may reinforce, at a variable cost of threat, any monster type listed on his card as a minion. spawned monsters act like reinforcements and are not activated until the overlord’s next turn. when a lieutenant is killed, the heroes gain 250 coins and 4 conquest points. the encounter ends as a party victory immediately and the lieutenant is placed in the graveyard box and is no longer available to the overlord. dungeons when the party ends their game week at a dungeon they have yet to explore, they can enter and explore it. each dungeon consists of 3 levels, generated separately when entered, linked by portals. any lieutenant within one trail’s length of the dungeon can fortify that dungeon. the overlord can put the power card listed on the lieutenant card(s) into play for free (or in lord merick farrow’s case, gain an extra 15 threat). this does not count against the number of power cards in play. if the overlord has bought any treachery, he may adjust his overlord deck. then he shuffles the deck and draws a new hand of 3 cards.when the heroes enter a new level, the overlord draws a dungon level card. cards describe the level’s leader, special rules, and the location in the quest guide. the dungeon level is set up and the heroes placed on or adjacent to the activated glyph as normal. then the overlord places the level’s leader as indicated, chooses his minions (usually group c requires wod and group d aod) and deploys them anywhere except the red-shaded areas. he may ignore los and abilities that interfere with spawning. finally, the overlord reads aloud the dungeon level description as well as the entire dungeon level card, and play begins normally, starting with the heroes. the reinforcement marker at the start of every level, the overlord places the reinforcement marker faceup (red eyes) in front of him. when he plays a spawn card it is flipped face down and while it is facedown he may not play spawn cards. he may spend 15 threat on his turn to flip it faceup. in the dungeon normally an entire level is revealed when the heroes enter it; only special levels have multiple areas. when a chest is opened the party rolls 4 black power dice and consults the chest loot table . coins are added to the party treasury, potions are selected by the group, and treasures are drawn from the listed deck as normal. potions and items are divided among the group as desired. when a hero activates a glyph of transport , the party gets 3 conquest points. to move through an activated glyph a hero must begin his turn on or adjacent to it. he then returns to tamalir, is placed in the building of his choice, and may immediately restock there instead of his normal turn (he may not perform any other action). on his next turn he may either return to the dungeon (declaring a normal action then moving to an activated glyph for 1 mp) or restock again, in the same building or another. once a hero steps on a portal leading to the next level his figure is removed from the map and he is invulnerable. once all the remaining heroes either enter the portal (or move to town) the overlord immediately constructs the next dungeon level and all heroes move to the next level. when the party goes through the 3rd level portal, they return to the surface. mark the dungeon as explored on the campaign sheet (it may not be re-entered) and either leave the party marker there or move it to tamalir. when a leader on each dungeon level is killed, the heroes gain 100 coins and 2 conquest points. when the leader on the 3rd dungeon level is killed, the heroes gain 250 coins and 4 conquest points. dungeon level leaders also carry a red runekey unless otherwise stated. fleeing a dungeon the heroes can flee a dungeon by all returning to tamalir at the same time via a glyph of transport. mark the dungeon as explored on the campaign sheet (it may not be re-entered) and move the party marker to tamalir. if the overlord goes through his entire deck 3 times (4 times for a rumor or legendary area), the heroes immediately flee the dungeon. party recovery at the end of every dungeon, all heroes are healed of lingering effects exactly as after outdoor encounters. all heroes may drink potions and use healing items.rumors when a hero visits or trains in a tavern and pays for a round of drinks, the overlord shuffles the rumor deck and draws the top card. any instructions at the top are followed immediately. then the rumor text and reward are read aloud. if there is currently no active rumor, the card becomes the active rumor and is placed faceup by the board. if there is, the party decides which to keep. discarded rumors are returned to the deck. the party decides on which unexplored dungeon a new rumor is placed. it cannot be closer to the party marker than the distance in trail-lengths listed on the card. mark the location with the rumor token and record it on the campaign sheet. if the party explores the dungeon with the rumor, the 3rd dungeon level is specific to the rumor and in the quest guide. the rumor reward is granted immediately when the specified conditions are met, and the card is (usually) removed from the campaign. other areas legendary areas the 3 legendary areas on the map are dungeons with special 4th levels that can only be explored at a specific campaign level, and only if the heroes have fewer total conquest tokens than the overlord: the caverns of thuul (copper), the fool’s rapids (silver) and the valley of souls (gold). secret master areas if the party begins their game week move in a secret master area (shika’s tree or olmric’s hut ), the heroes may choose a train action to improve their maximum and current wounds or fatigue, or improve their traits. rumors cannot be located at any of the above areas, nor can lieutenants enter or fortify them. the overlord’s keep and the final battle the party cannot move to or enter the overlord’s keep until the final battle begins. when the final battle begins, the overlord may purchase one final upgrade, and the party marker is moved to tamalir where each hero may train once in one of the buildings there. the heroes are then moved to the overlord’s keep. both the heroes’ and the overlord’s conquest point totals are reduced to 0. the keep is explored like a normal dungeon for the first 4 levels. the 5th level is special, depends on the overlord’s avatar and is in the quest guide. track new conquest token totals while the keep is explored. all buildings in tamalir are considered closed, but heroes may still re-appear at the temple when they are killed and can return via a glyph of transport. when the avatar appears, the overlord removes all other monsters, discards his in-play power cards and overlord cards, and puts the overlord deck away. each hero’s maximum and current wounds are increased by +1 for every 2 conquest tokens earned since entering the keep, and the overlord’s maximum and current wounds are increased by +2 for every conquest token earned since the heroes entered the keep. the avatar may battle and run as heroes do. any time he kills a hero he is healed of 2 wounds for every conquest token the hero is worth. the hero is dead and gone forever. once the battle is resolved the overlord reads the appropriate plot card. the campaign is concluded. cities and buildings when the party ends a move action on a city each hero must visit one of the buildings available there, and places his figure on that building at the bottom of the map. if a party already in a city chooses to train, heroes who choose to train choose one of the available buildings. each city has a special ability. in tamalir, if the heroes end a week’s action there, the party can buy a tamalir upgrade card (only once per week). each hero pays the listed xp. the card does not stop the party from doing other things in tamalir, and takes affect on the next week. hero upgrades trait and skill upgrades may be made when a hero trains at the training ground, or the party takes a train action at a secret master area. trait upgrades a hero can: – add a to one of his traits for 500 coins and 15 xp; – upgrade a to a for 750 coins and 20 xp; – upgrade a to a for 1,000 coins and 25 xp . no hero may ever have more than 5 power dice in any trait. keep the appropriate upgrade token with the hero sheet. heroes are limited by the number of tokens available. to add or upgrade a power die the relevant trait (melee, ranged or magic) must be taught at the current location. all traits can be trained at a secret master area. at copper level, a hero can upgrade a maximum of 3 of his to and may not upgrade . at silver level, a hero can upgrade as many as desired but a maximum of 3 of his to . at gold level, a hero can upgrade as many dice as desired to and/or . skill upgrades a new skill’s cost in coins and xp is found on the skill upgrade cost table. no hero may ever learn more than 5 skills. skills can only be learned if they are available at the current location. secret training when the party takes a train action at a secret master area, a hero can increase either his maximum wounds by 4, or his maximum fatigue by 2—either, not both, only once at each campaign level. at copper level, an upgrade costs 500 coins and 20 xp; at silver, 750 coins and 25 xp; at gold, 1,000 coins and 30 xp. take the wound or fatigue upgrade token corresponding to the current campaign level. power dice upgrades in addition to spending 1 fatigue to add a black power die to an attack, a hero can spend 1 fatigue to upgrade a to a , or a to a . he can do this as often as he likes as long as a given die is upgraded before being rolled.overlord upgrades the overlord may buy 1 only of the following upgrades using his xp each week during the overlord actions step. avatar upgrades avatar upgrades can improve the avatar himself, upgrade a specific type of monster, or bring into play a lieutenant. there are generic upgrades any avatar can use and 5 cards specific to particular avatars. the xp cost is listed in the card. once paid, the card is taken and kept faceup. when purchased as an upgrade, lieutenants enter play at the overlord’s keep. treachery upgrades the xp cost to purchase 1 point of treachery of a given type, and the maximum number of points of each type allowed, are listed on the avatar’s sheet. monster upgrades by spending the xp shown on his sheet the avatar can upgrade all of the monsters in one category (humanoid, beast or eldritch). at copper level, the overlord can upgrade only 1 monster category to silver form. at silver level, the overlord can have any number of silver form categories, but only 1 gold form category. at gold level, the overlord can have any number of silver and gold form categories, but only 1 diamond form category. plot upgrades each plot, which cannot be changed during the campaign, consists of 7 cards. one has a cost of 0 xp and introduces the campaign; 5 of the cards further the overlord’s evil plans; and the 7th is the final card and is read at the campaign’s end. hero dea th when a hero dies, he is placed in the temple building in tamalir and the overlord gains conquest points equal to the hero’s conquest value. neither the hero nor the party loses any conquest, experience or coins. the hero can return via a glyph of transport either at the beginning of his next turn, or after spending 1 or more turns restocking. quest items . some plot cards create quest items on the map. a lieutenant on the same location can pick up one at a time and carry it, unless it is in an unrazed city, where it is safe in the city vault. if the city is razed a lieutenant may take the item. the party can collectively pick up and carry quest items in the same way, but if the location has an unexplored dungeon they must explore it first and then remain in the location afterwards to pick it up. in an encounter involving a lieutenant, the side who defeats or forces the other side to flee takes any quest item the loser was carrying. if the winner already had an item, they must drop one of the two on the current map location. each city has a city vault that will hold 1 quest item (except for the vault at tamalir, which already holds the obelisk of journeys). heroes may leave a quest item in a city’s vault by leaving the token on the space and recording it on the campaign sheet."

move around enemy figures (unless that figure has the watchful ability); and may make attacks at any point during movement. facing has no effect. figures may not move into or through closed doors, blocking obstacles, or enemy figures at any time. attacking figures cannot attack when occupying the same square. every attack follows these steps: 1. declare attack declare which space is being attacked, and, if a marine, the weapon used. melee attacks can only be made from an adjacent square; invaders marked with a red bar may only make melee attacks. marines always have the fist, pistol and grenade attacks, marked in green. 2. confirm line of sight figures must be able to trace an uninterrupted straight line between the centres of the spaces. 3. count range & roll attack if a ranged attack, determine range by counting the number of spaces to the targeted space. roll the dice corresponding to the invader’s attack or the marine’s weapon. 4. determine attack success any miss result results in a failed attack (this is the only way a melee attack can miss). the attack hits if the total range numbers shown on the dice are equal to or greater than the range.5. inflict wounds the total number of bullet holes is the total damage. this must be equal to or greater than the target’s armor rating. every increment of damage equal to the target’s armor rating equals one wound. marines remove a wound token and invaders place a wound token next to the figure. re-rolls a single attack can never be re-rolled more than once. the affects of a opposing dodge and an aimed attack cancel each other out. scatter weapons with the blast ability will scatter if they miss (either by insufficient range or a miss result). draw the top card of the invader deck, turn it so the compass rose direction is matching that on the board, then find the space indicated by the number and direction shown from the original target space. the attack will hit this new space if moving to it does not pass through any walls, blocking obstacles, or closed doors. if it does, or the card shows a miss icon, it will explode harmlessly. ammo (marines only) to attack with a given weapon a marine must have at least one corresponding ammo token on his ammo bin. those with an infinity symbol do not require ammo. if one or more attack dice show a bullet icon, 1 ammo token of the appropriate type must be discarded. equipment tokens (marines only) equipment tokens can only be picked up by marines, and are automatically picked up by a marine in the same space. during his turn, a marine may give weapon or ammo tokens to adjacent marines at a cost of 1 movement point per token. ammo, armor place the token on the marine’s equipment bin. health discard the token and return up to 3 wound markers previously discarded. keys place the token by the compass rose; any security doors of that colour are now unlocked. weapons place the token on the marine’s reference sheet to indicate he can use the weapon. adrenaline at the start of a subsequent turn the token may be discarded to add 4 spaces of movement for that turn. beserk place the token by the marine’s equipment bin with the unfaded side up; the marine may only attack with his fists, but any attack instantly kills any invader. at the end of the marine’s next turn, flip the token; at the end of the following turn, discard the token.doors doors block movement and all attacks. it costs a figure located on one of the adjacent squares to a door 2 spaces of movement to open or close it. a door cannot be closed if an oversized invader blocks it. security doors security doors begin play locked; once a key of the appropriate colour has been found all security doors of this colour are unlocked for marines. invaders can never open or close a security door. airlocks airlocks automatically close at the end of any turn they were opened (this cannot be prevented by a marine with the tech op card; and any large invader blocking the door is killed). airlocks cannot be destroyed by a smash card. sentry bots sentry bots appear on the map in an unactivated state, can do nothing and cannot take damage. treat as an enemy figure for purposes of moving or attacking through the space. a marine can activate a bot by moving adjacent to it and expending 2 movement points. the marine is now in control of the bot (and can control a maximum of 2 at once). the bot takes a turn immediately after the controlling marine’s turn and may move up to 4 spaces and attack once. bots can benefit from the officer bonus to range and damage. they may not perform any special movement (including opening/closing doors) except moving through teleporters. they cannot have orders placed on them, and cannot normally be healed. invaders are not prevented from spawning within a bot’s los.other terrain, obstacles and objects airless terrain each time a marine ends his turn on an airless terrain space, he must discard an oxygen cylinder token or suffer 2 wounds (regardless of armor). board exits once a marine has moved off the board he may not return. damaging obstacles do not block line of sight or movement, but a figure entering a damaging obstacle space suffers 1 wound regardless of armor. a marine fragged in this manner still gives a frag point to the ip . a figure remaining on a damaging obstacle for its entire turn/activation takes an additional wound at the end of its turn/activation. ducts ducts work just like teleporters but can only be used by invaders with the scuttle ability. invaders cannot move to ducts that are not revealed or are being stood upon by a marine. exploding barrels exploding barrels block line of sight and movement. they explode if they suffer 1 point of damage, dealing 1 automatic wound to all figures adjacent. flame jets at the end of every round, flip all flame jet markers to their other side. a figure suffers 1 wound (regardless of armor) when entering, leaving or ending its turn in a space with a ‘on’ flame jet, or being in the space when it turns ‘on’. teleporters with 1 space of movement a marine or sentry bot only may move from one teleporter to another of the same colour (even if the other end has yet to be revealed). a marine teleporting into a space occupied by an invader automatically kills it.oversized invaders oversized figures can only be targeted once by a single attack, even if they occupy multiple spaces. demons demons occupy 2 spaces, and either move one half into a non-diagonal adjacent space while the other half moves into the space just vacated, or move both halves into a diagonally adjacent space by moving both halves in the same diagonal direction. exploring whenever a marine has line of sight to an unrevealed portion of the board it is immediately set up by the ip and any required text from the scenario read aloud. frags and kills killed invaders are removed from the board and returned to the ip’s reserves. killed (fragged) marines are removed from the board. the marine returns to his starting wound and armor tokens, discarding any extras (including beserk tokens) picked up during the game. at the start of his next turn the marine is respawned back on the board on a revealed empty space at least 8 but no more than 16 spaces away from where the marine was fragged. if no space meets these conditions, meet them as closely as possible. after a marine has been fragged the ip takes a frag token and keeps it as a frag point. accumulated frag points may win the game, depending on the scenario. timing and ‘start of turn’ event cards to be played at the start of the ip turn are played after draw and discard, but before invader activation. those to be played immediately before a marine takes his turn can be played until the mp declares his action."
83,22897,DREAMBLADE,2006,WIZARDS OF THE COAST,2.6972,142,"setup place the map between the players. each player arranges their warband in cost order in front of them. you may have up to 16 miniatures in your warband. miniatures can be any combination of aspects. you may not have more than 3 of a given miniature. game turn a turn is divided into the following phases. initiative phase 1st player’s spawn phase2nd player’s spawn phase 1st player’s two action phases 2nd player’s two action phasesconquest phase initiative phase each player rolls an initiative die; whoever rolls highest goes first. on a tie, the player who has won more turns goes first; otherwise reroll. if either player rolls a 1, both players skip their spawn phase. the first turn when rolling for initiative on the first turn only, reroll 1s and reroll both dice if there’s a tie. miniatures you spawn go in your portal. players should use both action phases of the first turn to shift (move). the best place for your creatures to end up on the first turn is usually the cell one row up and one column over from your portal. spawn phases the first player spawns miniatures, then the second player. spawn points add both player’s initiative rolls together for the number of spawn points each player can spend. if any abilities modify the initiative result, they don’t also modify the spawn points. for each of your miniatures that has been destroyed since your last spawn phase, you get +2 bonus points. if you skip your spawn phase, any bonus spawn points that you have remain until your next spawn phase. you can spawn any number of miniatures one at a time. if you spawn 2, the first can help satisfy the aspect cost of the second. at the end of each spawn phase, any unspent spawn points are wasted. aspect costs for each aspect symbol in a miniature’s cost, you must have one miniature of that aspect already in the dreamscape or graveyard. for each miniature you come up short, you must spend 1 extra spawn point to spawn the miniature. aspect cost: the aspect symbols indicate which aspect(s) the miniature belongs to. each symbol represents one miniature of the indicated aspect.spawning you spawn creatures into your portal cell. you can spawn into one of your spawn row (first row) cells other than your portal if: 1. that cell didn’t contain an ally at the start of your spawn phase. 2. you control a miniature in the same column as the spawn row cell. you can spawn up to 4 creatures into a cell each spawn phase. you can always spawn creatures in your portal, even if you control no miniatures in that column, it isn’t empty, or there are already 4 of your creatures there. there can still be only one location in the portal. locations are spawned in any cell where you control a creature. there can only be one location in a cell, and locations don’t move or attack, or contest or claim cells. spawn abilities some abilities can be activated during the spawn phase, usually at any point during the phase and at a cost in spawn points. each spawn ability can be activated only once per spawn phase. abilities that alter initiative results don’t alter spawn points. action phases the first player takes 2 action phases, then the second player. during each action phase, you can either shift or strike. the chosen option applies to all the creatures you control. when you shift, your creatures can move but not attack; and when you strike, your creatures can attack but not move. shift each of your unengaged creatures (no enemy creatures in the same cell or the only enemy miniature in the cell is a location) may move to an adjacent cell. engaged creatures (those with at least one enemy creature in their cell) can’t move when you shift. creatures move orthagonally, but not diagonally. a cell can contain up to 8 creatures (no more than 4 for each player) and one location. strike your engaged creatures may attack, one cell at a time in any order. you cannot choose the same cell twice. a creature’s power is the number of attack dice the creature contributes to an attack. a numbered face indicates that amount of damage. symbols indicate a miss. all your creatures in a cell do so as part of a single combat, though you may keep some creatures out of an attack. on a regular attack specific defenders are not chosen. blades if locations or attacking creatures have blade abilities, and you roll one or more blades, you must assign the blades to these miniatures. activate blade abilities before damage is assigned, one at a time if you wish, and in any order and some and not others, if a creature has more than one blade ability. some creatures have both negative and positive blade abilities.damage damage from your creatures is split as you wish among the enemy creatures in the cell. at the end of the combat: damage at least equal to a creature’s defense will disrupt it (all damage on it clears). damage at least equal to a creature’s life will destroy it. if you deal damage at least equal to both a creature’s defense and its life, you may choose whether to disrupt or destroy it. a disrupted creature is moved to an empty cell in the dreamscape at the end of the combat. a destroyed creature is moved to your graveyard. some creatures have abilities that allow a creature to take damage more than once during a phase. at the end of each combat, creatures that have taken less damage than their defense or life still have that damage until the phase ends. if they take more damage later in the phase, they could still be disrupted or destroyed. if creatures take damage during a phase other than an action phase, the damage remains until the end of the phase. any extra damage is wasted at the end of each phase. deathblow if some of the second player’s creatures are destroyed during one of the first player’s action phases, those creatures may attack local enemies just before they are put into the opponent’s graveyard. creatures that are destroyed in the same attack make their deathblows together. blades count as misses during a deathblow. creatures destroyed during one of the second player’s action phases don’t make deathblows. neither do creatures destroyed during other phases, including the spawn phase. disrupted creatures don’t get deathblows. you choose how to assign damage from a deathblow among the local enemy creatures. even creatures that didn’t participate in the original attack can take damage from a deathblow. moving during combat some abilities will result in creatures moving, but what matters is the state of the cell when you conduct the attack there, not the state of the cell at the start of the phase. conque st phase at the end of the turn, if you have at least one creature in one of your scoring cells and there are no enemy creatures there, you score the conquest points for that cell. each player scores 1 conquest point for each enemy miniature that he destroyed that turn. locations can’t claim cells, nor do they contest cells to prevent enemy creatures from claiming them. whichever player has the most total conquest points wins the turn and advances one space on the victory track. on a tie, neither player wins the turn. the first player to win 6 turns is the winner of the game.activation requirement s when you roll blades, you activate your miniatures’ blade abilities. you must assign blades if you can; if you cannot, it has no effect. you must attack with a creature to use its blade ability. you can use a location’s blade abilities if local allies are attacking. some other abilities are activated by spending spawn points on them, having the miniature on a scoring cell, or simply by spawning the miniature. blade abilities blade results on the attack dice can be used as follows: blade: to make the ability work, assign a blade to it. you can assign only one blade to the ability. multiblade: for each blade you assign to the ability, it activates once. you can assign any number of blades to the ability. double blade: to make the ability work, you need to assign 2 blades to it instead of one. you can’t assign one blade to the ability. double multiblade: you must assign 2 blades to make the ability work, and each time you assign 2 blades, it works once. you can’t assign an odd number of blades to the ability. other abilities spawn cost: to make the ability work, you must spend spawn points. you spend spawn points only during your spawn phase. you may activate each such ability only once per spawn phase. score: to make this ability work, the miniature must be on one of your 6 scoring cells. the ability works even if the scoring cell is contested. this requirement is sometimes combined with spawn points. comes into play: the ability works when you spawn the miniature. zone s of play reserves all the miniatures in your warband start in your reserves. they spawn from your reserves to the dreamscape. dreamscape once spawned, creatures move across the dreamscape fighting each other and claiming scoring cells. when one of your miniatures is in the dreamscape, you control that miniature. if an ability refers to a creature you control, a creature in your reserves or graveyard doesn’t count. graveyard destroyed creatures go to your graveyard and stay there until the end of the game. removed from the game some effects remove miniatures from the game altogether. handling destroyed creatures when your creature is first destroyed, place it in the map border. at the end of the turn, when your opponent scores conquest points for them, tip them on their sides. when you use their bonus spawn points, remove them to your graveyard. on turns where you skip the spawn phase, tipped-over miniatures stay in place. for all game effects, destroyed miniatures are considered to be in a graveyard right away.abilities general rules a miniature’s ability takes precedence over the game rules. if one ability says something can happen and another says it can’t, the “can’t” ability wins. if an ability has you do something you can only partly complete, do what you can. a player that is doing more than one thing in a phase can generally do them in any order. attacks and damage when you deal damage, you must assign that damage if you can. you can’t voluntarily reduce the damage you deal. you may not decline to disrupt or destroy a creature. if, however, you deal damage at least equal to both the creature’s defense and its life, it’s your choice whether you disrupt or destroy the creature. you may assign more damage to a creature than is necessary to disrupt or destroy it if you want to waste the extra damage. you check to see whether a creature has been disrupted or destroyed each time it takes damage (but see simultaneous effects). damage clears at the end of every phase. special attacks, including deathblows, generate damage only. blades rolled on the attack dice are treated as misses. creatures with 0 power, which contribute no attack dice, may participate in an attack like any other creature. you can assign blades you roll to this creature’s blade ability. simultaneous effects multiple effects triggered by the same game event are simultaneous. all simultaneous effects are resolved before any other effects or actions take place. the effects controlled by the player whose phase it is resolve first. if it’s a shared phase, effects controlled by the first player resolve first. if one player controls more than one simultaneous effect, that player decides their order. if simultaneous effects deal damage, resolve all simultaneous effects before checking for disruption and destruction. if simultaneous effects in turn trigger multiple effects, those effects are also simultaneous. minimum stats power and cost can’t be reduced below 0. defense and life can’t be reduced below 1. damage can’t be reduced below 0. minimums apply after all modifiers. if a new modifier is added, recalculate the result with all modifiers and then apply the minimum. targeting abilities that use the term target mean that you choose the miniature, cell, or other thing in question. some special attacks require that you target an enemy creature first. choose the creature before rolling the attack dice, and that creature is the only one to which damage from the attack can be assigned. abilities some blade abilities use may. even if you assign a blade to the ability, you don’t have to use it. you can use these abilities to “dump” blades that you don’t want, such as when an ally has a negative blade ability. abilities with an activation cost that includes s only activate if they’re on a scoring cell. if a blade ability affects a creature’s stats, its effect lasts only until the end of combat.destroying your own miniatures unless an ability allows you to do so, you can’t destroy your own miniatures. if one of your creature’s abilities does destroy a miniature you control, no player scores conquest points for it; but you get the +2 bonus spawn points on your next spawn phase. sacrificing a miniature doesn’t count as destroying it. if you sacrifice one of your own miniatures, no player scores conquest points for it. you don’t get the bonus spawn points. abilities list advance: may move target unengaged ally one cell. ambush (x): make an x-power attack against each enemy

shuffle each deck (dungeon, crypt, corpse, door, search, trap, treasure, and catacomb) and place it, facedown, on its board space. shuffle the combat and dragon decks. separate the power cards for each of the 5 monsters into decks. shuffle the monster tokens facedown. organize the other tokens into separate piles. each player randomly chooses a hero card (or players may agree on who they will play), then takes the corresponding plastic figure, travel marker, and power cards and rolls 1 die. the highest roller (reroll ties) is the first player and takes the first player token. shuffle the rune deck. each player draws 1 rune card and places it faceup next to his hero card. unused cards are returned to the box. the first player places his hero figure in one of the 4 tower rooms at the corners of the dungeon, then the other players place their figures in clockwise order. heroes may not start in the same tower room. game turn the first player starts and play continues clockwise. each player completes his turn before the next takes a turn. on his turn, a hero must move into an adjacent space or search the chamber he is in. heroes cannot move and search in the same turn. heroes that search do not encounter the chamber they are in. moving move your figure through a passage to an adjacent space. diagonal movement is never allowed. you cannot move into a chamber occupied by another hero, except for the treasure chamber. after you move into a chamber space, you must encounter that chamber. if there is a monster token, you encounter the monster first. if you kill the monster, you must then encounter the chamber. every space on the board without a dungeon chamber (except tower rooms and the treasure chamber) is unexplored. when you move into an unexplored space, you must randomly draw a dungeon chamber from the pile and place it faceup in the space, with the entry arrow adjacent to the chamber you moved from. when you attempt to move through a door, you must first draw a door card. if the card is door opens, continue movement as normal. if the card is door jammed or hidden trap, you must remain in the chamber. you may try the door again next turn or leave by a different passage. if you attempt to move through a door that is adjacent to another door, only draw 1 door card to determine success.when you attempt to move through a portcullis, you must make a strength test. if you succeed, continue movement as normal. if you fail, your turn ends; you may try again next turn. if you attempt to move through a portcullis adjacent to another portcullis, only make 1 strength test to determine success. if you attempt to move through a door and a portcullis, resolve each in order, starting with the chamber you currently occupy. dead ends if all of a chamber’s passages except the one you entered run into walls, you have reached a dead end. you can only leave the chamber by moving to the chamber you entered from (if possible) or by successfully searching for a secret door or a passage to the catacombs. you are killed if you becomes trapped in a dead end and do not succeed in finding a way out after searching twice. searching to search a chamber, draw the top card from the search deck. you may search a chamber twice on successive turns; after this, you must move on the next turn; you cannot search again until you have moved. if you return to the same chamber later, you may search it again, for up to 2 successive turns. you may only search chambers featuring a search icon and only if there are no monster tokens in the chamber. encounter s after you complete any instructions on a card or chamber, the encounter is resolved. once all your encounters have been resolved for your turn, your turn ends. encountering dungeon chambers most chambers have special instructions, triggered when you move into them. some have lasting effects that always supersede any normal rules for movement. if you enter a chamber with a monster token in it, you must encounter the monster before encountering the chamber. encountering cards whenever you are instructed to draw cards, you must take the top card of the appropriate deck, resolve all instructions, then (usually) discard it to a discard pile next to its deck. loot cards are kept faceup next to your hero card. any effect that refers to the monster card type also applies to monster tokens. encountering monsters encounters with a skeleton, sorcerer, troll, golem, or demon may lead to combat unless you manage to escape. some threat cards may turn into monsters and lead to combat. each monster has a set of 4 power cards and 4 monster tokens. resolve encounters with monsters as follows: 1. determine monster player the player to your left takes on the role of the monster for that encounter; he takes the 4 power cards with the monster’s portrait and shuffles them into a facedown stack.2. draw monster token the monster player draws a monster token with that monster’s portrait at random from the pool and places it facedown in front of himself. the number on this token is the monster’s life value. if a monster token is not available in the pool, take one from the board instead. 3. escape or attack the hero must then decide if he wants to escape or attack. you may not escape if the chamber you entered has a portcullis or if you entered the chamber by special movement such as a secret passage from the search deck. escape both the hero and the monster player randomly draw 1 card from their power cards stack and compare the escape values (the white number in the bottom left corner). if your escape value is less than the monster’s, you fail to escape and must face the monster in combat. you also suffer wounds equal to the monster’s damage value (the black number in the bottom left corner of the monster’s power card). if your escape value is equal to or greater than the monster’s, you escape. the monster player places his monster token facedown in the chamber where the monster was encountered. it remains there until killed. the monster’s card, if there is one, is discarded and all power cards are returned to their respective decks. play then passes to the next hero. when you successfully escape, you must leave the chamber where you encountered the monster and return to the chamber you entered from. you do not encounter the chamber you return to and your turn immediately ends. however, on your next turn, you must then encounter the chamber you escaped to as if you just entered it. if you entered the chamber through a door, you do not have to draw another door card to escape. attack if you choose to attack,or if you attempt to escape and fail, combat begins. the treasure chamber heroes can move into the treasure chamber as if it were a dungeon chamber. it is treated as a single space. when you enter the treasure chamber, randomly draw 1 dragon card from the dragon deck. if the card drawn is sleeping, follow the instruction on the card to draw 2 treasure cards, and your turn ends. leave that dragon card faceup. on your next turn, you must either move out of the treasure chamber by any passage or stay there and draw another dragon card. if the card is dragon rage , discard all of your treasure cards and then roll 2 dice and suffer that many wounds. if this does not kill you, you must retreat, moving out of the treasure chamber through the passage of your choice to an adjacent space, drawing a dungeon chamber if the space is unexplored. your turn then immediately ends. retreating heroes may not move through a door or portcullis. a hero retreating in this manner does not encounter that chamber, regardless of whether the chamber was previously explored or not. however, on your next turn, you must encounter the chamber as if you just entered it.you may remain in the treasure chamber until you decide to leave or you wake the kalladra the dragonlord. once you have looted as much as you dare, you may leave the treasure chamber during your turn, treating it as a normal move. you do not draw any dragon cards on the turn you leave. the treasure chamber is the only space in the dungeon that you can move into if it is already occupied by another hero. the more heroes drawing cards from the dragon deck, the more likely the dragon will wake up. when the dragon wakes, all heroes in the chamber immediately suffer the consequences, starting with the player who drew the dragon rage card and proceeding clockwise to the other players with heroes in the chamber. then the game carries on with the normal turn order. if there are no heroes in the chamber at the end of a player’s turn, all of the drawn dragon cards are shuffled back into the dragon deck, facedown. however, if there are 2 or more heroes in the chamber, none of the cards are shuffled back into the deck until the last hero leaves. on a later turn, heroes may return to press their luck anew with the replenished and shuffled dragon deck. runnin g out of time the sun token’s location on the sun track indicates the amount of time heroes have remaining before the game ends. when the first player takes his turn, before he performs any actions, he advances the sun token 1 space on the sun track.the sun token does not advance on the first turn of the game. once the sun token reaches a space marked with a number, the first player must roll 1 die: if the number rolled matches the number or falls within the range of numbers listed, the game immediately ends. at that moment, any heroes still inside the dungeon are killed. if the sun token reaches the last space on the sun track, the first player no longer advances the token, but he still rolls a die before each of his turns to see if the game ends. even if the first player is eliminated, exits the dungeon, or is forced to lose his turn, he still advances the sun token and may need to roll for game end at the start of his turn as normal. exitin g the dun geon the only exits from the dungeon are in the tower rooms. a hero entering a tower room may immediately choose to move out of the dungeon from it. if you choose not to, you immediately move out of the tower room through one of its passages and encounter the chamber you enter. you do not have to exit the dungeon through the same tower room that you started the game in, and you are never obligated to exit the dungeon if they enter a tower room. once you have exited, you cannot enter the dungeon again; you must remove your figure from the board and can no longer explore the dungeon. you must now wait until the game ends before the victor is determined. a hero may not exit the dungeon unless he possesses at least 1 loot card (any loot card; it does not need to have a value).combat if you encounter a monster and do not escape, combat results. combat always involves a single hero against a single monster. attacks can be melee (red), ranged (blue), or magic (yellow). while power cards are in your hand or played during a combat round, they are considered combat cards for the purposes of all rules and special abilities regarding combat. each combat round is 4 steps performed in order: 1. draw combat cards each player draws cards from his combat deck until they have a hand of 5 cards, kept hidden from the other player. during the first round, each player randomly draws 1 of his power cards before drawing to 5 cards. power cards used during an escape attempt may not be drawn. 2. reveal combat cards each player places 1 card from his hand (power or combat) facedown. then, these are simultaneously turned faceup. if either of the cards are power cards, any special effects are resolved; hero first, then the monster player. 3. resolve counterattack if the attack value of a player’s combat card is equal to or lower than his opponent’s attack value and his card has a counterattack icon matching his opponent’s attack type, the player may make a counterattack. the player plays cards from his hand with a counterattack icon that matches his opponent’s attack type and then adds his cards’ attack values together to determine his total score. a player making a counterattack may play multiple cards (one at a time) to increase his total attack value. he must stop playing cards once his total attack value exceeds his opponent’s attack value. only one counterattack may be made in a round; a player may not counterattack against a counterattack. 4. assign damage the player with the highest total attack value in the round is the winner of that round. he places all the combat cards he played during the round in the loser’s damage stack. each card in a player’s damage stack in front of him represents one wound has has suffered in the combat. the loser of that round places his combat card in the combat stack between the players. this represents the maneuvering of the combatants to set up a more powerful strike. players must be able to see the numbers and attack types of all cards in the combat stack, and the number of cards in the other player’s damage stack. after resolving this step, if neither the hero nor monster has been killed, return to step 1. deathblow a deathblow results if the winner of a round plays a card matching the attack type of any card(s) in the combat stack. he takes all of the cards in the combat stack with the same attack type as the attack type of the card he played and adds them to his opponent’s damage stack. deathblows are resolved before the loser of a combat round places his card on the combat stack. stand-offs a stand-off occurs when both the hero and the monster have the same attack value. a player may still counterattack and turn the stand-off into a victory if his card’s counterattack icon matches his opponent’s attack type. if both players’ cards have the same attack value and the same attack type, the round automatically ends in a stand-off without any opportunity to counterattack. both of the players’ cards are placed on the combat stack and players return to step 1. canceled cards if a power card allows a player to cancel his opponent’s combat card, all text on the card and its counterattack icon are ignored. the card’s attack value is also reduced to 0 and cannot be increased above 0 (any modifiers are ignored). if a card is canceled that has a “next round” ability, that ability may not be used on the following round. end of combat combat ends when either the monster or the hero is killed. the monster’s card that started the combat, if there is one, is discarded to the discard pile of the deck it was drawn from. all power cards are returned to their respective decks, and all combat cards are shuffled back into the combat deck. hero victory the monster’s life value is on the bottom of its token. during combat, only the monster player may look at the number. if the monster has a number of cards in its damage stack equal to or exceeding its life value, it is killed; the combat ends. all of the cards in the hero’s damage stack are converted to actual wound tokens. the monster token is shuffled back into the pool. monster victory during combat, each of the cards in a hero’s damage stack counts as 1 wound. these wounds are added to the number of wound tokens the hero accumulated before the combat. a hero with wounds (wound tokens plus cards in his damage stack) equal to or greater than his life value is killed. the monster player places his monster token in the chamber the monster was encountered in. damage to a victorious monster does not carry over to later combats. explorin g the catacomb s when you encounter a “passage down” dungeon or search card, you may enter the catacombs on your next turn instead of moving or searching. whether or not you choose to enter, you must place a catacomb entrance marker on that chamber. exception: if the chamber is a cave-in, you may still enter the catacombs, but do not place a catacomb entrance marker. when you encounter a catacomb entrance chamber or a dungeon chamber with a catacomb entrance marker, you must encounter the chamber as normal. on your next turn, you can choose to enter the catacombs instead of moving or searching. when you enter the catacombs, place your travel marker next to your figure, with the arrow pointing in the direction of your choice. then remove the figure from the board. once you have placed your travel marker, your direction of movement has been set and you may not move the marker or point it in a different direction. you may enter a chamber that contains another hero’s travel marker, and can enter the catacombs from the same chamber. if you choose to do so, place your travel marker on the chamber as normal, and point it in any direction you choose. encounters in the catacombs a hero in the catacombs must draw a catacomb card at the start of each of his turns. these are resolved following the normal rules for encountering dungeon cards, and are piled beside your hero card instead of being discarded, so you can count them when you find an exit out of the catacombs. if you resolve an encounter that instructs you to discard the card, the card is still placed in the pile beside your hero card. monster tokens are not placed during catacomb encounters. exiting the catacombs when you resolve an encounter that allows you to exit the catacombs, you must find out where you resurface. advance your travel marker 1 space in the direction it is pointing for each catacomb card you have accumulated (including the card you drew that turn). choose whether you shift left or right and then roll a die to determine how far you shift to the left or right after you have advanced the appropriate number of spaces in the direction your travel marker points. you do not explore or encounter any spaces you pass under. if you have drawn so many cards that you would pass outside the dungeon, only count as many catacomb cards as will take you to the outer wall of the dungeon. when you resurface, place your figure back on the board and remove your travel marker. then return all the catacomb cards you collected to the catacomb deck and shuffle it. any loot or encounters with instructions to keep the card are not returned to the deck. if you enter the catacombs again, those cards do not count towards advancing in the catacombs. if you resurface from the catacombs in a chasm or bridge, you may choose which side of the chamber you place your figure on. if on a bridge, he must then attempt to cross it. if you encounter a monster the turn after you exit the catacombs, you must attack; you may not attempt to escape. resurfacing in an explored space when you resurface into an explored space such as a dungeon chamber or the treasure chamber, your turn immediately ends. you do not encounter the chamber or any monsters there. on your next turn, you must encounter the chamber (instead of moving or searching) as if you just entered it. you may resurface in a chamber with another hero. resurfacing in an unexplored space when you resurface into an unexplored space, you immediately draws a dungeon chamber and place it on that space, with its entrance arrow pointed in the direction of your choice. then your turn immediately ends. on your next turn, you must encounter the chamber (instead of moving or searching) as if you just entered it. attribute tests heroes have 4 attributes: strength, agility, armor, and luck. to make an attribute test, roll 2 dice: if the total is greater than the attribute, the test fails; if equal to or less, the test succeeds. determination tokens whenever you fail an attribute test, take 1 determination token. the next time you attempt the attribute test for that encounter, each of your determination tokens increases your relevant attribute by 1. after resolving the encounter, discard all determination tokens. runes each rune can be used once per game. when you wishe to use a rune, discard the rune card at the time indicated on the card and resolve its effect. discarded rune cards are not used for the rest of the game.mon ster token s if all the monster tokens of a type have already been placed on the board, the monster player must choose a token of that type on the board and move it to the chamber instead. if a monster player needs to place a monster token in front of himself to establish a monster’s life value, but all the tokens of that type have already been placed on the board, he must choose a monster token of that type on the board. he cannot examine the life value on the monster tokens before choosing. if you encounter a monster token on the board and kill the monster, the token is removed from the board and is now available to be placed on the board again on future turns. death & elimination the most common way for a hero to die is by taking a number of wounds equal to or greater than his life value. when your hero is killed, you lose the game. your hero is removed from the board and all his cards and tokens returned to their respective decks and piles. flip his card facedown. killed heroes can no longer affect the game. eliminated players still participate in the game and continue to play the role of monsters for the player to their right. when you heal, discard the indicated number of wound tokens from your hero card. winnin g the game the game ends when every player has either successfully left the dungeon or has been killed. each player who exited the dungeon totals the value of his loot cards. loot cards without a gold value are worth 0 gold (unless otherwise indicated). the player who exited the dungeon with the highest total value in gold is the winner. any effects that are resolved at the end of the game must be resolved before gold values are tallied, starting with the first player and then so on in clockwise order. if surviving heroes tie for the highest gold total, the tied player with the single loot card worth the highest gold value wins. if it is still a tie, the tied player with the most loot cards wins. if it is still a tie, then all tied players win the game. if nobody escape the dungeon, all players lose and dragonlord kalladra is the winner. solo dungonquest in the solo game the player must perform the monster’s actions during combat. when a monster token is drawn, the token is placed faceup instead of facedown, and the player knows how much damage is required to kill the monster. combat step changes 1. draw combat cards do not add a power card to your hand. power cards are only used in escape attempts. the monster does not have a hand of cards at all. 2. reveal combat cards when the monster plays a combat card, he simply plays the top card of the combat deck. 3. resolve counterattack (if able) if the monster is able to make a counterattack, reveal the top 5 cards of the combat deck. if any are able to be used for a successful counterattack, they must be played. remaining revealed cards are discarded. a player can win if his hero manages to exit the dungeon with at least 1 treasure card before nightfall. try to beat your previous highest total gold value for a more challenging game."
86,36367,DUST TACTICS,2010,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,2.9057,53,"setup each unit has an army point (ap) value. both sides must field units whose total ap value does not exceed the scenario’s ap limit. choose a scenario or design your own. set up the battlefield by following the scenario instructions, or create the battlefield by setting up tiles. each player rolls 3 dice. the player who rolls the most places the first terrain square, and then he and his opponent take turns placing them until they are all on the board. each player rolls 3 dice. the player who rolls the most chooses and places the first cover element, and then he and his opponent take turns placing them until they are all on the board. cover can only be placed in the cover zone indicated by the scenario. definitions a unit may consist of vehicles, soldiers, and/or heroes, and includes all the miniatures represented on its unit card. a squad is always a group of soldiers. a vehicle, tank, or robot is an armored land vehicles, never a soldier or hero. a miniature is a single vehicle, soldier, or hero. the game tiles are divided into 9 spaces, in which units stand. an entire squad or a vehicle must stand within the space it occupies. very large vehicles that don’t fit in one space are placed in the middle of a tile. during the first round, units must enter the battlefield: their first action on the battlefield is always a one space move. all options are not immediately available (since the unit already moved once), but if there is a target in range, you may attack it immediately. basic rules the game is divided into rounds. during each round, each unit on each side gets one chance to act. roll for initiative each round using 3 dice. the player who rolls the most decides which side plays first that round (re-roll ties). at the start of the round, the player going first chooses one of his units and activates it. before activating a unit, you must declare all of that unit’s intended actions, including any skills or special weapons that he wants to use. rotate the unit card 90ª to indicate that the unit has been activated this round; it may not do anything else until the next round. the player’s opponent’s then activates one of his units, and so on, until all the units on both sides have been activated. the round then ends, all unit cards are refreshed, and a new round begins. if it is your turn to activate a unit, but all of your units have already acted this round, your turn is skipped. your opponent continues activating units until all of his units have had a chance to act.activated units may perform up to 2 actions per round from the following list: move: the unit may move up to its movement value. attack: the unit may attack using all of its weapon lines. skill: the unit may perform a skill listed on its unit card. (free skills are free do not count towards the 2 actions per round, but the unit must still activate to use a free skill.) nothing: the unit does nothing. sustained attack: the unit spends both actions, rerolling all results once for each weapon line. movement a unit’s movement value is the number of movement points (mp) it has per round. when moving diagonally, enter the first space normally. any additional diagonal movement costs 2 mp per space. once a unit stops, it may not move again until next round. units can change direction as often as they wish during movement, and facing is unimportant. units can never enter a space occupied by an enemy. a vehicle can never pass through a friendly soldier or vehicle. a squad or a hero may pass through any friendly unit, but cannot end its move in the same space as another unit. squads and heroes may always move diagonally, unless both corners are blocked (ie, spaces they cannot enter). vehicles cannot move diagonally if even one of the corners is blocked. spaces without a center dot (or if a terrain piece hides the dot) are impassable; no units may enter them. cover & movement a space with an ammo crate can be entered by any unit (vehicles entering the space may choose to crush the crate). a space containing anti-tank traps can be entered by squads and heroes, but is impassable to vehicles. attac ks weapons each weapon on a unit carries has a weapon line, showing how many dice to roll (first number) depending on the target’s armor, and the amount of damage (second number) that each hit inflicts. for a squad, multiple the number of dice listed on the weapon line by the number of soldiers so equipped who are still alive. each weapon line can aim at its own target. a unit with multiple weapons can combine or split its weapon lines against one or several targets, as desired. the first weapon line on the unit card matches the weapon most of the miniatures carry. the second is always the special weapon. the third is usually explosives. close combat weapons are last. all squads come with at least one special weapon. the number in brackets after the special weapon is a reminder of how many of that weapon are in the squad: refer to picture on the card to see the weapons the miniatures are carrying. 1. check range check to see if your target is within range. counting spaces is done in the same way as movement (diagonal rules apply). 2. check line of sight (los) check that los between the shooter and the target is clear. trace an imaginary line from the dot in the shooter’s space to the dot in the target’s space. if the line crosses a space with no dot, the shot is impossible (los is blocked). all spaces without a dot block los. squads block los for other squads, but do not block los for squads shooting at vehicles or vehicles shooting at squads.vehicles block los for all squads and vehicles. when shooting, treat spaces occupied by vehicles as spaces without a dot. if an enemy unit has clear los to a friendly unit, that friendly unit has clear los to that enemy unit. ammo crates do not block los. anti-tank traps block los when soldiers are targeting other soldiers, but do not block los otherwise. los around corners a unit adjacent to impassable terrain can target a unit also adjacent to impassable terrain when both units receive corner cover from the same side. the unit cannot target the unit when they receive corner cover from different sides. 3. declare targets all of a unit’s intended actions (including skills or special weapons), and each weapon line’s targets (including close combat attacks) must be declared before any dice are rolled. a unit is never forced to use all of its weapons. all attacks are simultaneous. hits cannot be ‘saved’ and redirected against other targets. if you forget to announce the use of one of your weapons, it does not shoot this round. 4. roll dice roll the number of dice indicated by the appropriate weapon line. some rules modify attack rolls. a may sometimes be required for an action to succeed: at those times it is each that causes damage points. 5. check cover saves check if your unit is behind cover, check whether it is soft cover (ammo crates) or hard cover (anti-tank traps). when a squad is in a space with a cover element, all of the squad’s miniatures benefit from the cover bonus. cover saves only apply to squads. heroes do not receive cover saves when alone, but when a hero joins a squad, he benefits from the squad’s cover value. a squad receives corner cover (soft cover) when the attacking unit’s los passes through the corner of a space that blocks its los. the targeted squad must be adjacent to the terrain feature or vehicle that blocks the attacking unit’s los. corner cover only applies if the attack is at a 45 degree angle from the attacker to the target. when a unit receives soft cover from two elements, the unit is considered in hard cover. terrain features can provide combined cover up to hard cover. check the unit card of the unit in cover: roll dice equal to the number of the unit suffered; each you get cancels a . roll dice equal to the number of the unit suffered; each you get cancels a . if no die result is shown, the squad gets no protection from this type of cover and no cover save. close-combat weapons (range c) ignore all types of cover. a unit may attempt to destroy a cover element. ammo crates: 3 and 2 . anti-tank traps: 5 and 4 . vehicles entering a space with an ammo crate may choose to crush the crate.if you are attacking a piece of cover and a unit that share the same space, announce which of the targets each weapon is shooting at. when the same unit, using different weapons, shoots at both the unit and the cover at the same time, the shots aimed at the cover are resolved last. 6. suffer damage after a successful attack, each rolled causes damage points to the target depending on the weapon. each damage point causes vehicles and heroes to lose 1 health point ( ), or squads to lose 1 miniature.if the target was a vehicle or a hero, mark off crosses on the unit card. when all have been marked, the vehicle or the hero is eliminated and removed from the board. in the target was a squad, remove 1 miniature for each lost, chosen by the player controlling the squad. as a unit suffers casualties, the number of dice rolled for its attacks will change. when a unit attacks with a ranged weapon, the defender removes casualties immediately after the attacker resolves each attack. when a unit attacks with a close combat weapon (range c only), each player simultaneously removes casualties from his squad. reactive fire reactive fire is a special action available to all units that haven’t been activated yet during the current game round. it temporarily interrupts the action of an enemy unit to allow one of your units to open fire. select one of your inactivated units and roll 1 die. if you roll a , your unit may not fire. whether you succeed or not, attempting reactive fire activates your unit for the round. it can’t perform any other actions for the rest of the round. if you roll a your unit immediately activates and performs a single attack action with all weapon lines that have sufficient range to target the opposing unit. once you’re done, the enemy unit continues with its action. to attempt reactive fire, the unit must have a weapon with the range to attack and damage the target unit. reactive fire can only target the unit your opponent activated, and no other units. reactive fire situations if a unit performs the actions move + attack, reactive fire must occur immediately after the move action. if a unit performs the actions attack + move, reactive fire must occur immediately after the attack action. if a unit performs the actions move + move, reactive fire must occur immediately after the first move action.if a unit performs a skill action to use its charge ability (the action sequence move + move + close combat attack), reactive fire must occur immediately after the second move, but before the close combat attack. (if a unit has the fast skill, reactive fire must occur after it has completed all of its movement.) if a unit performs a sustained attack, no reactive fire can occur. heroes heroes can be activated alone like any other unit, and are subject to all of the rules that affect soldiers. they are the only units that can share a space with a friendly unit (even when they’ve not joined the squad) or vehicle. a hero can join a squad before a battle if they share the same armor class. place both unit cards together. there can never be more than one hero attached to the same squad and a hero cannot join a squad during a game. the hero and the squad are activated at the same time and his weapons are used at the same time as his squad. some of his skills affect the squad, and all the squad’s skills affect the hero. the unit’s movement value is the fastest value of the two units. when the combined unit suffers a damage point, choose who loses one : either remove one of the squad’s miniatures (as usual), or mark off a cross from the hero’s unit card. when the hero loses his last he is eliminated. a hero and his squad may separate during the game; from then on, the hero operates alone as a separate unit and cannot rejoin that squad or any other. separate the unit cards to indicate they are acting independently. superhumans superhumans are a step above regular heroes. a superhuman can never join a squad. sidekicks are normal heroes with the sidekick skill and function as heroes, with the exception that they can form a special squad with the indicated superhuman. this ‘squad’ is made entirely of heroes, and therefore cannot benefit from squad rules. otherwise, superhumans function as heroes: they never benefit from cover, they can share a space with another unit, and 2 identical superhumans can never fight on the same side. however, a second identical superhuman can appear in an opponent’s army of the same type. command squads a command squad is a special squad composed of an officer, a radioman, a mechanic, a medic, and a weapon specialist (no special ability). when a figure is eliminated, the squad loses that figure’s specialization. you can field more than one command squad unit at the same time, but each unit must have a different armor class. when you activate a command squad, announce which skill you want to use; you may only attempt to use 1 skill once per round. if the attempt is not successful, you cannot attempt any other command squad abilities during this round. any unit with a command squad skill (nco or otherwise) cannot use its skills on any unit that also has a command squad skill. a hero may only join a command or nco command squad if he has the commander skill. if a revived/repaired unit is eliminated a second time, it counts as another unit being destroyed when calculating vps. officer get moving you bunch of monkeys! (skill). perform 1 skill action and roll 1 die. on a , reactivate one adjacent unit immediately after the command squad’s activation is finished. if there is a radioman in the officer’s squad, he can issue this order to any unit on the battlefield. radioman relay the radioman can relay any order issued by the command squad to anywhere on the battlefield. this skill may be used in conjunction with other command squad abilities. this skill is always active and does not require a die roll, so you may use an officer’s skill in conjunction with the relay skill. using relay with other command squad abilities is the only way to use more than one command squad skill in the same round. artillery strike (skill). the radioman can call in an artillery strike. when the radioman is eliminated, the command squad cannot use the artillery strike skill. mechanic makeshift repair (skill). perform 1 skill action to restore 1 to an adjacent non-destroyed vehicle (the radioman’s relay skill cannot facilitate remote repairs). field repair (skill). perform 1 skill action and roll 1 die. on a , finish the command squad’s activation and then immediately activate the repaired vehicle, which enters the battlefield from its side’s deployment spaces. if the radioman is eliminated, the skill does not work. a mechanic can only successfully use this skill once per game. medic get up, it ain’t that bad (skill). perform 1 skill action to either revive 1 miniature in an adjacent squad, or restore 1 to an adjacent hero. a miniature returns to its squad with its special weapons and full ammo for any limited weapons. this skill cannot be used on an eliminated squad or hero.come on guys; we’re going back out there (skill). perform 1 skill action and roll 1 die. on a , finish the command squad’s activation and then immediately activate the revived squad, which enters the battlefield from its side’s deployment spaces. if the radioman is eliminated, the skill does not work. the medic cannot revive a hero and can only use this skill once per game. nco c ommand squads a nco command squad is a command squad composed of a field officer, a field mechanic, and a field medic, each equipped with his own radio. when a figure is eliminated, the squad loses that figure’s specialization. you can field only one nco command squad unit at a time. field officer artillery strike (skill). the unit is an observer. perform 1 skill action to immediately activate a friendly artillery unit on the battlefield and perform 1 indirect shot at a unit to which the observer can trace los. the target must be within the artillery weapon’s range. smoke mortars (skill). once per game, immediately target 1 space in los (not into a structure) with this artillery strike. place a smoke token in the space or use a terrain square with a diamond in its center. the smoke effect remains in the space until the end of the round after it was launched. field mechanic ammo dump (skill). once per game, any unit within los instantly replenishes all of its limited ammo weapons. makeshift repair (skill). perform 1 skill action to restore 1 to an adjacent non-destroyed vehicle. field medic stimulant kit (skill). once per game, inject a soldier unit in an adjacent space with combat drugs. the next time that squad is activated, it can perform 4 actions that round (in any combination). if the squad performs 2 consecutive attack actions against the same target, it is a sustained attack. the squad can perform 2 attack actions against the same target as long as the attack actions are not consecutive. at the end of its activation the squad is exhausted: lay all of its miniatures on their sides. while exhausted, the unit cannot be reactivated by any command squad, cannot perform any action, and cannot fight back if attacked in close combat. the next time it is activated, it costs the unit both its actions to stand upright. a hero joined with a unit that is injected is also injected. a lone hero can be injected instead of a squad. get up, it ain’t that bad (skill). perform 1 skill action to either revive 1 miniature in an adjacent squad, or restore 1 to an adjacent hero. a miniature returns to its squad with its special weapons and full ammo for any limited weapons. this skill cannot be used on an eliminated squad or hero. structures all interior and exterior structure walls block los, provide corner cover, and cannot be destroyed. a unit inside a structure follows the standard rules for attacking and moving. moving to enter (or exit) a structure, a unit must go through an entrance: a door or a window. units can only enter a structure from the ground floor, and cannot enter a structure diagonally, as the corners of the entrances block diagonal movement. a unit with the jump skill cannot enter a structure by jumping. there are two types of entrances to structures: large (one space wide) and small (less than one space wide). soldiers and heroes can enter structures through any entrance. vehicles can enter structures through large entrances (wide enough for the vehicle’s base to pass through), but not through small entrances. aircraft cannot enter any structure. a unit can use a move action to move up or down 1 floor for each mp spent. units may move diagonally both vertically and horizontally. each space, in any direction, costs 1 mp. units inside can also move onto the structure’s roof by moving up from the structure’s top floor. soldiers and heroes with the jump skill can jump over any structure (if it can move far enough to reach the other side). vehicles with the jump ability cannot jump over any structure. units cannot land on top of structures. cover a squad is in soft cover when they are inside a structure and it is targeted by an enemy unit also inside the same structure. a squad is in hard cover when it is inside a structure and it is targeted by an enemy unit outside the same structure. a unit inside a structure attacking an enemy unit outside must be on a space that shows an entrance in the direction of the attack. a unit outside a structure attacking an enemy unit inside must be on a space that shows an entrance. a squad on the roof of a structure is outside of that structure. it is automatically in soft cover when targeted by an enemy unit that is not also on the roof of that structure. inside a structure, cover combines in the normal way. the walls of small entrances do not provide corner cover, but block los. anti-tank traps can only be placed inside structures that have at least one large entrance. units on separate floors and directly above or below each other are not considered to be adjacent. firing when a unit inside a structure attacks an enemy unit outside a structure, calculate range from the ground floor beneath the attacking unit’s space. when a unit outside a structure attacks an enemy unit inside a structure and above the ground floor, add 1 space to the distance when calculating the range. weapons with range c cannot attack any target that is above or below the attacking unit, regardless of range. when 2 units are at the same height, draw an imaginary line from the dot in the center of the activated unit’s space to the dot in the center of the target unit’s space. remember that the entrance to a structure does not allow los to run through diagonally (even when the units are at different heights). when 2 units are at different heights, look at the battlefield from above and attempt to trace an imaginary line from the dot in the activated unit’s space to the dot in the target unit’s space. if los would be clear without thinking about height, then los is clear in 3d. if los would not be clear, if the unit on the lower level is directly behind the object that would block 2d los, then los is blocked in 3d, no matter how high up the other unit is. however, if the unit on the lower level is not directly behind the obstacle that would block 2d los, then los is clear between the unit on the lower level and the unit on the higher level. a unit cannot attack an enemy unit that is more than 1 floor away. when units are only 1 floor apart, floors and ceilings do not block los, and both units are considered to be in soft cover. units that are directly above or below each other are not considered adjacent and cannot engage in close combat. note that the unit on the lower level must add 1 to its range.quonset hut s huts follow all the normal structure rules, with these exceptions: each hut has one door and 3 windows. only soldier units may enter huts, and only through the door. units can attack through the windows and doors following the normal rules for structures. huts are never more than 1 story tall, can only be entered at ground level, and block los in the same way as structures. huts only grant soft cover to units inside them when those units are being attacked from outside. no cover is granted to a unit attacked by another unit within the same hut. longer huts can be created by placing 2 or more hut tiles next to one another so that the semicircular roofs form a continuous line in a single direction, creating a hut with a single entrance, or an entrance at each end. if the roofs of 2 tiles do not align, the tiles are considered separate structures instead. terrain types spaces without a symbol or dot (impassable terrain) block all movement (except flying units only) and los. cover elements cannot be placed on impassable terrain. circle spaces can be entered by any unit and occupied by any type of cover element. triangle spaces (deep water) block movement (except flying units or units with the jump ability), but do not block los. cover elements cannot be placed on this terrain. cross spaces (piles of rubble) can be entered by infantry, flying units or units with the jump ability; but not vehicles. they do not block los, but grant soft cover to squads. cover elements cannot be placed on this terrain. diamond spaces (smoke or visual obstruction) can be entered by any unit, but block all los. units on this space can only be targeted by attacks from an adjacent space and can only attack a target in an adjacent space. cover elements can be placed on this terrain. square spaces (trees) block movement for all ground vehicles, even those with the jump skill. soldier units may move into and through trees, and squads gain soft cover in them. trees block los, but a soldier unit in a trees has clear los to and from any other unit not blocked by another obstacle. cover elements cannot be on trees. a unit with a flamethrower or artillery weapon can destroy a tree tile by using an attack action with the tree as its target. it cannot simultaneously target both the tree and a unit sharing the same space. roll 3 dice; on at least 1 remove the tree from the board. minefields minefield tokens can only be placed in spaces that soldier units can pass through. when a soldier or vehicle unit moves into such a space, for each token, roll 1 die separately for each miniature in the unit. if a is rolled, the miniature suffers 1 point of damage. aircraft units are not affected by minefields. end of the game the game ends (always at the end of a round) when: - one player’s units are all destroyed. - one of the players fulfills his scenario objective. - the scenario reaches its round limit. players calculate vps to determine the winner. - neither player can fulfill their objective (eg, all objectives were destroyed). players calculate vps to determine the winner. to determine vp totals, calculate the total ap value of all enemy units each player destroyed during the scenario. some scenarios specify bonus vps for successfully fulfilling a condition. the player who earned the most vps wins."
87,73171,EARTH REBORN,2010,Z-MAN GAMES,3.897,301,"setup choose a scenario and build the map as shown using the board frame, appropriate floor tiles, and doors. each player chooses a faction and takes a player aid screen and the character cards for their characters in the scenario, placing them in front of their screen with their healthy side faceup. position the matching miniatures on the map according to the scenario instructions. put all the order tiles in the cloth bag and the command point (cp) / wound counters in a pile (the bank). follow any other setup steps in the scenario instructions. turn sequence 1. initiative phase drawing order tiles each player secretly draws order tiles from the bag and lays them faceup behind his screen until he has a total of 5 tiles. if you have kept order tiles from the previous turn, only draw enough tiles to reach 5 tiles in total. start with the player who has the initiative marker, followed by the other players in clockwise order. if the bag is empty, return all tiles from the discard pile to the bag and resume drawing. for the first turn only, a player may draw 5 new tiles from the bag, and return the tiles he initially drew to the bag. obtaining command points (cp) each player receives cp counters from the bank and places them behind his screen, determined by: your base cp allowance as specified in the scenario bonus cp, if any, for each character card under your control at the beginning of this phase (see the bonus cp icon). determining initiative the scenario determines who receives the initiative and plays the first round in the activation phase. that player takes the initiative marker and places it in front of his screen. 2. activation phase the activation phase consists of a series of rounds. a round is one action chosen from the list below performed by one player. actions generally require spending command points (cp). the player currently performing an action is the active player. activate a character (? cp) you may activate a character you control. engage its character card (rotate it clockwise 90°) on its first activation this turn. then perform either or both of the following options: 1. assign an order tile choose an order tile from behind your screen and place it below the character card. only one new order tile can be assigned per round of activation; but a character may have any number of order tiles assigned to it at any given time. order tiles stay assigned until discarded in the final phase. if you forgo the option of assigning an order tile when first activating a character, the character is waiting for orders. a tile may still be assigned to it in a later activation round.2. execute one or more orders take cp counters from behind your screen and place them next to a chosen order section from the assigned order tiles. then execute the order(s). in a single round of activation, you can execute multiple orders from the same order tile, or execute multiple orders from different assigned order tiles. the orders can be the same or different types, but they need to be executed in sequence. place the cp on each order as you execute that order to keep your opponent guessing. you may attach an order tile to a character, yet spend no cp on it or any other order tiles assigned to the character, saving the orders for a future activation round. cp may still be spent on it in a later activation round. command point constraints cp may only be spent on empty order sections (order sections that have not previously received cp). the number of cp counters in an individual section may not exceed the number shown on that order section. the total number of cp spent on the character since the beginning of the turn may not exceed his maximum cp per turn. you may spend less cp on an order section than the maximum allowed for that section; remaining available cp there are lost. order execution constraints an order section with more than 1 cp must be executed as a single order, and cannot be split into several orders of fewer cp. separate order sections must be executed as separate orders (even the same type), and cannot be merged into a single order. the move order is not subject to some of these constraints. reactivate previously activated character (? cp) once every character under the player’s control has been activated (all character cards engaged), you may reactivate a previously activated character. the character card stays engaged; you may assign an order tile to it and spend cp. draw 1 order tile from the bag (1 cp) return 1 cp from behind your screen to the bank. then draw one order tile from the bag and place it behind the screen. if there are no more order tiles in the bag, return all order tiles from the discard pile back to the bag, then draw your tile. during the activation phase, there are no limits to the number of order tiles you may have behind your screen. however, no more than 5 tiles may remain by the end of the turn. choose 1 order tile from the discard pile (2 cp) return 2 cp from behind your player’s screen to the bank. then search through the tiles in the order discard pile, secretly choose one, and place it behind your screen. this action cannot be performed if the pile is empty. pass do nothing for this round. if you chose to pass in a previous round you may still decide to act again in the next round. if all players pass in succession, the activation phase concludes and players proceed to the final phase. end of round when the active player has performed one of the above actions, it is the end of his round of activation. close all sliding doors that have been opened this activation round. the opponent becomes the active player; it is now his turn to play a round with one of the actions above.3. final phase check for victory conditions by referring to the scenario rules. disengage character and equipment cards by rotating them counterclockwise 90°. move all order tiles assigned to characters to the order discard pile, facedown. return all cp counters back to the bank, including all unused cp counters behind player screens. all players discard order tiles in excess of 5 from behind their screens, and may discard all or part of their remaining tiles. announce and show the other players (facedown) how many tiles you are keeping behind your screen. move for every cp spent on a move order, a character gains as many movement points (mvp) as the movement value on its card. a character does not have to use all its mvp, but unused points are lost at the end of the order. unlike other orders, you may spend cp on move order sections that already contain cp counters, and a move order section containing more than 1 cp may be split into individual move orders. separate move order sections from one or more order tiles may also be merged to execute a single move order. movement restrictions moving to an adjacent square costs 1 mvp. squares are adjacent if they touch on one side and are not separated by a wall or closed door. diagonals are never used for movement. characters may pass through friendly or dead characters, but may not pass through enemy characters, walls, or closed doors.they cannot enter squares outlined with a yellow dotted line, unless the floor element has been destroyed. there can never be 2 figures in the same square at the end of a round. a figure may change its facing any time during its movement without using mvp, as long as it always faces the side of a square, never diagonally. facing is indicated by the direction the knife on the figure’s base is pointing. at the end of movement, choose a final facing for the figure. it stays in this position until the next move order. doors small doors are 1 square wide, large doors are 2 squares wide. a door can never cover a double wall. both types of doors (sliding and wooden) can be opened, and wooden doors can be closed, by a figure immediately facing the door using 1 mvp. turn the marker over to indicate a wooden door is open, and slide the marker to the side to indicate a sliding door is open. characters cannot close sliding doors; they close automatically at the end of the activation round. wooden doors stay open unless closed by a character. doors with a magnetic card icon can only be opened if the character carries a magnetic card, or the door is destroyed. any character can close a wooden magnetic door even if he is not carrying a magnetic card. a player may transfer a magnetic card between characters at no mvp cost if one character moves through another friendly character. a character moving through a dead character marker may pick up a magnetic card on the dead character. exiting the map except when forbidden by the scenario, characters can always exit the map by reaching any square ‘outside’ the frame during movement. he is then safe but may never return. any equipment cards or equipment markers he was carrying are removed from the game.close combat spend 1 or more cp on a close combat order section of a tile assigned to an activated character (the attacker) to attack one orthogonally adjacent enemy character (the defender) or to destroy adjacent floor elements. you may not attack more than one enemy with a single close combat order. however, in a single activation round, a character may perform close combat against 2 adjacent enemies by spending cp on 2 different close combat order sections. 1. determine combat strength the enemy’s position dictates which inside circle arc on the figure’s base determines combat strength: dark-blue: the figure’s highest combat strength.light-blue: the figure’s standard combat strength. grey: the figure’s lowest combat strength. close combat weapons increase a character’s combat strength. look up the appropriate arc color on the combat chart of the equipment card to determine the number of additional combat dice or automatic hits granted by the weapon, and add these combat bonuses to the character’s basic combat strength. a character can carry more than one close combat weapon, but can only use one in a given close combat order. 2. resolve close combat each player rolls combat dice equal to their combat strength. striking hard: if more than 1 cp is spent on the close combat order (requiring a close combat order section showing a number greater than 1), every cp in excess of 1 gives +1 combat die to the attacker. critical hits for each die showing a critical hit, automatically inflict one wound on the enemy. place a wound counter from the bank on the character card. the defender can inflict wounds on the attacker with critical hits, but not with normal hits. critical hits are always applied first and may result in the character’s card being flipped to the wounded side (possibly resulting in a lower armor value for the normal hits). normal hits the defender counts all the normal hits he rolled on his combat dice, plus any automatic hits, and adds them to his armor value to determine his defensive value. the attacker counts all the normal hits he rolled on his combat dice, plus any automatic hits, and compares his total hits against the defensive value. if the total hits exceed the defensive value, the defender receives one wound for each hit that exceeded the value. if the hits are is equal to or less than the value, nothing happens. wounded and dead characters when a character card on its healthy side has received wounds equal to its life points (lp), remove all wound counters from the card and flip it to its wounded side. any remaining hits are placed on the wounded side. when a character card on its wounded side has received wounds equal to that side’s lp, the character is dead. a character may go from healthy to dead if it sustains wounds equal to or higher than the total lp on both sides of the card. remove the figure from the board and position the matching marker in its place, face side showing. place the figure on its character card to show he is dead and cannot be activated. if the dead character was carrying a magnetic card, the enemy character who eliminated him can take the card for free.destroying floor elements, doors, and walls any floor element with a defensive value icon may be destroyed. doors (except open doors) and wall sections may be destroyed. the active player executes a close combat order with the target as defender. if a floor element spans multiple squares, a successful attack against one of the squares destroys the entire element. the combat is resolved in the same way as it would be against an enemy character, with the following distinctions. the target does not roll dice and has no combat strength, armor value, or lps. doors and floor elements have a defensive value on an icon on the element itself. single or double walls have a defensive value of 10. the attacker rolls his combat dice and adds up all hits as usual, but each critical hit counts as 3 normal hits. add automatic hits as required. if the total number of hits equals or exceeds the defensive value, the target is destroyed. if lower, nothing happens. place a destroyed floor element marker on any square of a destroyed floor element; every square it was covering is now destroyed and its properties or special capabilities are canceled. all the squares are now considered normal floor. destroyed doors are removed from the game. if the door was covering a single wall, replace it with a broken door marker. destroyed single or double wall sections are covered with a short broken wall marker. two short markers that are adjacent and in a straight line may be replaced with a long marker. line of sight to have line of sight (los) between a figure and a target square: the target square must be within the figure’s arc of sight (aos). the red and orange arcs on the outer circle on a figure’s base define his aos; the white arc defines what is outside the aos. los between the figure and the target square must not be blocked by an obstacle. draw a straight line from the center of the figure’s square to the center of the target square (or place a los check marker on each square and connect the center red dots). los is blocked if the line crosses a closed door, a wall, or a square occupied by any figure. dead characters do not block los. some floor elements with a blocking los icon also block los (though los can reach a figure standing on such a square). if a diagonal los passes exactly between 2 squares, los is only blocked if both squares are blocking. shoot only characters carrying firing weapons can shoot. only one firing weapon can be used in a given shoot order. to perform a shoot order with an activated or interrupting character (the shooter), spend 1-4 cp on a shoot section of an order tile assigned to him, and choose a target enemy figure, door, wall, or floor element. 1. check los check that the shooter has a los to the target. if he does not, the shoot order fails (the cp remain spent). 2. determine required range count the squares to the target (not using diagonals), including the target’s square but not the shooter’s. you may shoot at an adjacent target. you may shoot at a door or wall; if it is adjacent, range is 0 and targeting is automatically successful.3. roll for targeting total the shooter’s shooting value and the firing weapon’s shooting value (if any), and add any other shooting bonuses. improved targeting: each cp in excess of 1 gives +1 yellow die. announce the extra cp before rolling; no more than 4 cp in total can be spent on a shoot order section. roll dice (you may roll less dice if you wish), adding any automatic distance points: if you roll at least one perfect shot, targeting is successful no matter the range. if the total distance rolled equals or exceeds the range, targeting is successful. in any other situation, targeting fails; cp spent on the shoot order remain spent. you may roll fewer dice than you are entitled to. ammunition if the shooter rolls at least one out of ammo icon, his weapon will need to be reloaded before firing again. only firing weapons with the out of ammo icon can run out of ammunition. engage the equipment card to indicate it cannot fire by rotating it 90º. only reloading it can disengage it. out of ammo icon: only firing weapons with this icon can be reloaded, and only during the carrying character’s activation, not during an interruption. spend 1 cp and place it on the card of the activated character carrying the weapon, then disengage the equipment card. this cp counts towards the maximum cp per turn for the character. no order tile section is used; you can perform a reload action in addition to other orders in the same round of activation. fixed ammo icon: place a wound counter on the equipment card every time it is fired. when the number of counters reaches the ammo number remove the equipment card from the game (or, if search is being used, faceup to the bottom of the search pile). when transferring a firing weapon from one character to another, the equipment card stays in the same state. 4. roll for damage if targeting is successful, check the outer circle on the shooter’s base to see if the target is in the red or orange fire arc (if exactly between the two, the shooter chooses which arc to use). look up the matching red or orange damage icon on the equipment card, and roll combat dice. pour it on: each additional cp in excess of 1 gives +1 yellow damage die. announce how many extra cp spent on the shoot order you are using before rolling. cp used to improve targeting cannot be used again to increase damage, and no more than 4 cp in total can be spent on a shoot order section. critical hits for each die showing a critical hit, automatically inflict one wound on the target. place a wound counter from the bank on the target’s character card. critical hits are always applied first and may result in the character’s card being flipped to the wounded side (possibly resulting in a lower armor value for the normal hits). normal hits the shooter counts all the normal hits he rolled on his combat dice, plus any automatic hits, and compares them to the target’s armor value. if the total hits exceed the target’s armor, the target receives one wound counter for each hit that exceeded the value. if the hits are is equal to or less than the armor, nothing happens. shooting floor elements, doors, and walls a shooter can target any closed door, wall or destroyable floor element in the same way as in close combat. duel players duel to steal initiative, or interrupt each other’s actions. players in the duel each secretly place cp counters from behind their screens in their hand, extend their closed fist over the table and simultaneously reveal their counters. the player who asked for the duel must bet a minimum of 1 cp. whoever bet the most cp wins the duel. on a draw, nothing happens. all cp bet by both players go to the bank. dueling for initiative at the end of the initiative phase, the player who doesn’t have the initiative marker can ask for a duel; the other player cannot refuse. the winner gets the initiative marker (until the next initiative phase, when the scenario again specifies who gets it). on a draw, the player currently holding the marker keeps it. dueling for interruption during the activation phase, the non-active player can ask for a duel if a character he controls (the interrupting character) meets one of the following conditions: a. an enemy character is activated in his los: as soon as the active player declares which character he is activating (even before he assigns an order tile to him). b. an activated enemy character enters his los for the first time this round. he cannot ask later in the round if the activated character performs further movements or orders in the same character’s los. c. an activated enemy character enters a square adjacent to him and in his los for the first time this round. he cannot later in the round if the activated character performs further movements in adjacent squares. the interrupting character’s card does not become engaged as a result of the interruption; and it does not matter whether the character has been previously activated. the non-active player can ask for a duel multiple times in a single round, from the same or different characters, as long as each duel is triggered at a different time in the round. the outcome of a previous duel does not prevent additional duels. you may not ask for a duel if the interrupting character has already spent cp up to his maximum cp per turn. you may not ask for a duel when the activated character is passing through a square occupied by another character, but you may once he exits the square, if he is still in los. there can only be one interruption by one character under way at any given time. the non-active player must identify which character is interrupting before the duel can start. resolving a duel for interruption if the active player wins the duel, or there is draw, nothing happens and he resumes his turn. if the non-active player wins the duel, the activated character pauses and the non-active player can: assign a new order tile to the interrupting character. only one can be assigned to a character per activation round. in the case of an interruption, the non-active player is in the context of the active player’s activation round. if the same interrupting character wins 2 duels in one round, a new order tile can be assigned to him in only one of the interruptions. execute up to 2 red or gold colored interrupting orders from any order tiles assigned to the interrupting character. the player may decide to execute no orders, either as a result of a mistake or because his duel was a bluff. once the interrupting character has executed up to 2 orders, the activated character resumes his turn.order colors black orders can only be used for activated characters, while red and gold orders can be used for activated characters and interrupting characters. pause when the non-active player asks for a duel, before it resolves, the active player can choose the facing of the activated character. if the active player loses the duel, the character must keep that facing as long as he is paused, and can do nothing except defend himself if he is attacked. note how many mvp and unused cp he has left. he resumes executing his orders from the point when he was interrupted. if the activated character becomes wounded while paused, take into account his new movement value and max cp per turn. any partially executed order can be completed using his previous values, but any new orders are subject to the new values. equipment characters carry equipment cards (firing weapons, explosive weapons, close combat weapons, and special items) placed faceup below their character card. place equipment markers on the character card; they follow all equipment card rules. a character may carry any number of equipment cards if their total weight does not exceed his weight allowance. a character with a weight allowance of 0 can only carry equipment cards with a weight value of 0, or markers (which weigh nothing). dropping and transferring equipment if a character violates the weight limit, he must immediately drop enough equipment cards to fall back within the limit. dropping is immediate, costs nothing, can be done in the middle of an order, and is only possible when violating the weight limit. remove the equipment cards from the game, (except in scenarios using search). during a move order, a player may exchange equipment between characters at no mvp or cp cost if one character moves through another friendly character. character death and equipment when a character dies, stack his equipment cards underneath his character card. dead characters have no weight limit to check, and cannot receive equipment. if a character is killed during close combat, the character that killed him may take any or all of his equipment at no cost. during a move order, a character moving through or stopping on a dead character marker may pick up equipment on the dead character at no cost. explosive weapons weapons and items with the explosive icon cause an explosion when triggered. apply all normal shooting steps; however damage is caused to an area of effect as represented on the equipment card, with the target square usually at its center. starting from the targeted square and moving outward, make a separate damage roll for every target (any friendly or enemy character, door, single wall section, double-wall section, or destroyable floor element) in every square of the area of effect. additional cp spent to pour it on in an explosion only needs to be spent once to provide the bonus to all the rolls. if there are more than 2 targets on a single square, roll separately for each target. don’t check damage for open doors. if a target spans more than one square, it only suffers damage once; choose one square and roll damage for that square only. if a door, wall, or double wall separates 2 squares in the area of effect, the explosion cannot spread from the first square to the second unless the wall or door is destroyed by the explosion.iconographic phrasing system (ips) the ips line (special abilities) of equipment cards and floor elements are triggered with an interact order of at least the number of cp required by the conditions. if no cp are required, an interact order is not necessary; the effect is automatic. character special abilities do not need interact to be triggered. timing (red): the phase in which the ability can be used. condition (purple): the conditions that must be met before attempting the ability. chance (blue): how many yellow or black dice the activated or interrupting character must roll to attempt the ability. if the icon refers to a characteristic, the number of dice to roll, or the number of automatic hits, is specified on the character card next to the corresponding icon. threshold (green): the threshold level for a successful test.effect (yellow): if timing is respected, the conditions are met, and the test is successful, the effects are applied. interact the interact order is used, among other actions, to trigger the ips line of floor elements and special item equipment cards that require spending cp. to interact with a special item, a character must be carrying it. to interact with a floor element, a character must be standing in front of it on the square with the facing icon, facing in the direction indicated by the red arc. if a room shows an ips line and no facing icon, the ips line can be triggered from any square in the room, regardless of facing. executing an interact order spend enough cp on an interact section on an order tile to meet the ips conditions, and apply any other ips conditions. roll dice specified by the ips, if any. each additional cp spent on the interact order section grants +1 die of the same color. 0 1 2 2 3 0 0 2 3 3 3 if the totai test points equals or exceeds the ips threshold, the effect is triggered. if not, nothing happens; cps spent are lost. interact restrictions a special item can be triggered as many times as desired in the same turn or round, by the same or different characters. a floor element can only be triggered once per turn per character, whether the triggering is successful or not. switch on: when the on effect is triggered, place the on marker on the secondary ips line starting with the on icon to show that it is now active. switch off: when the off effect is triggered, flip the on marker to off: the secondary ips line is now inactive. if an equipment card or floor element has an on marker on it, it can be switched off. a floor element can be switched on by a character, and then off by another, in the same turn or round. when more than one ips line is available on the same card or element, the active player decides which he wishes to trigger. only one ips line can be triggered at a time. floor elements that can be destroyed (those that have a lose the special ability of their ips line when they are destroyed. the timer icon causes the effect to be delayed. when the ips line is successfully triggered, place on the line as many wound counters (called time counters) as are indicated in the timer icon. during each final phase, remove one time counter from all ips lines with time counters. when the last counter is removed from an ips line, its effect is applied. electricity: this icon indicates that the special ability relies on electricity to function. electrical power can be shut down to certain rooms or the whole building through the use of either the generator floor tile or the wiring plans equipment card. when the power is down in a room with an electricity icon, the ips line on that floor element is disabled until the end of the turn, when the power comes back on again. if the element had time counters on it and the power is down in this room, no counter is removed during the next final phase. doors with a magnetic card icon connected to rooms where the electrical power is down can be opened by characters without magnetic cards; and sliding doors no longer close automatically. these doors only close automatically at the end of the final phase in which the electrical power comes back. if the electrical power is down in the whole building, all magnetic card doors and sliding doors are affected. mission points/morale points teams may earn mission points (mp) which can then be spent as morale points to boost troop capabilities. when a scenario uses mp, place each player’s mp marker on their starting number on the mp score track on the board frame. the scenario rewards players with mp when specific objectives are reached, or by using special items, spying, interacting with certain floor elements, or triggering certain special abilities. search any character can use the search order to search in any square if he is standing on a floor tile with a room type icon. you may not search outdoor squares, drillers, stairs, or sewer exits. when a scenario uses the search rule, after each player takes his equipment cards, one player shuffles all remaining equipment cards together under the table, then places what is now called the search deck on the table. the other player may cut the deck. the top card of the search deck is always visible. in scenarios using the search rule, all dropped equipment cards go to the bottom of the search deck, in the order they were dropped, with the discarded equipment side faceup. at any time a player can look at the back side of any equipment card carried by any character, friendly or enemy. executing a search order spend 1-4 cp on a search section of an order tile assigned to the activated or interrupting character, and check the character’s search value. each additional cp spent beyond the first grants +1 black die. roll black dice, add all search points (sps) rolled, plus any automatic sps, and use them in addition to the rolled icons to search through the deck. take the search deck in hand with only the topmost card visible and the deck horizontal. +0sp +2sp +3sp +3sp +3sp 1spypt use 1 sp to pass the topmost card to the bottom of the search deck (same side faceup). if desired and at any time, use one of the special icons rolled (flip, shuffle, or spy point). if the top card shows at least 1 room type where found icon matching a room type icon on the floor tile the character is searching, the character can take it, as long as the remaining unused sp are at least equal to the card’s find factor. once an equipment card is taken, the search order is over and all remaining sp or unused special icons are lost.players can take equipment cards of any color. remember to check the character’s weight limit. discarded cards go to the bottom of the deck with the discarded equipment side faceup. flip the search deck over along the long edge. shuffle the search deck in the same way as during setup. spy points obtained during a search order can only be converted into mps if the scenario is on foreign ground. spy points spy points can be earned with: search, torture, some special abilities (from characters and floor elements), and special items. spy points must be used as soon as they are earned. each spy point earned may perform one of the following: gain 1 mission point (mp) secretly look at and sort the top 3 cards of the search deck: look at both sides secretly; all players will be able to see the top of the fourth card. then place them in any order, any side faceup, and return them to the top of the deck. for 2 points, look at and sort the top 6 cards of the search deck, and so on. secretly view one of your opponent’s mission cards, randomly selected (he should not know which was viewed). for 2 points, view 2 different mission cards from the same opponent, and so on. this can only be done when playing the sags. character special abilities a character’s special ability is an ips line on their character card. being wounded may result in losing or modifying a special ability. a character must be activated to use his special ability.a character does not need an interact order tile to use his special ability. any cp that need to be spent are placed directly on the character’s card and not on an order tile. these cp count towards his maximum cp per turn. a character can use his special ability multiple times during the same turn and even during the same activation round, as long as he can apply the ips conditions each time. any test must be performed each time to trigger the effect. you may not gain additional dice for the test by spending additional cp, as you would on an order tile. if a character card has more than one ips line, the player chooses which one to use. an interrupting character can use his special ability; each time counts as one of the 2 orders he can execute during the interruption. if he uses it twice, he can no longer execute any red or gold order. radio scrambling radio scrambling may be triggered by switching on the portable radio scrambler card or the fixed communication room radio scrambler. both have the same ips line. during the activation phase, the character must spend 1 cp on an interact order, and perform a test using his technical value. you may spend more than 1 cp, each extra cp adding +1 yellow die as usual. if you score 3 or more test points, the radio scrambler is switched on. place an on marker on the equipment card or floor element. it stays on until switched off or destroyed. a player who switches a radio scrambler on scrambles the other player’s faction’s frequencies. place the 6 radio scrambling markers matching your color behind your screen.initiative phase: radio scrambling setup during the initiative phase, each player who has switched on a radio scrambler must dispatch his 6 radio scrambling markers, attaching one marker facedown to characters controlled by opponents (not dead or captured characters). if there are fewer than 6 opponents, excess markers are set aside, facedown. a player dispatching scrambling markers is the scrambling player, and a player controlling a character receiving a marker is a scrambled player. initiative phase: switching radio channels each scrambled player then gets one chance to switch one radio channel. he exchanges (facedown and without looking at them) 2 markers of the same color attached to 2 of his characters, or between a character he controls and any excess radio scrambling markers that were set aside. no marker is revealed. activation phase: radio scrambling when an activated or interrupting character with a scrambling marker has spent cp in excess of the cp bonus on his character card, he must reveal the radio scrambling marker. the radio frequency is clear: nothing happens and the character can keep on acting normally. the enemy is listening to this frequency: the scrambling player gains 1 spy point. the character can keep on acting normally. the radio frequency is scrambled: the scrambled character cannot spend more cp than the cp bonus on his character card. removes all excess cp from the character before executing the order the cp were spent for, and place them behind your screen. you may also retrieve the order tile you have just attached to this character, if it has no cp on it. a character with a cp bonus value of of 0 must reveal any scrambling marker attached to him as soon as he is activated or interrupting, even if he has just been activated as ‘waiting for orders’. these effects are applied immediately. if a player reveals an opponent’s scrambling marker when he was not supposed to, the scrambling player earns +2 mp and the effect of the scrambling marker becomes applicable when and if the character it is attached to exceeds his cp bonus. switch off and reactivating a radio scrambler to turn off the portable radio scrambler, first get the equipment card from the character carrying it (usually by killing him); then execute the ips line on the card to switch it off. a player can switch off the portable radio scrambler and then switch it on again for his own team using the same or another character, by repeating the test with the same ips line. to turn off the communication room radio scrambler, a character must face the radio scrambler floor element on one of the 3 facing icons and execute the ips line to switch it off. the communication room radio scrambler cannot be reactivated by the same character that turned it off since it can only be triggered once per turn by the same character. when the radio scrambler is switched off, remove the 6 corresponding radio scrambling markers from the game. electrical power down when the power is down in the communication room or the whole building, the communication room radio scrambler ceases to function. the player who switched it on immediately takes back his 6 radio scrambling markers behind his screen. he will be able to use them again during the next initiative phase when the power comes back on. cutting the power does not switch off the radio scrambler, it just stops its effect until the next initiative phase. the portable radio scrambler is not stopped when the power is down. if a character drops a portable radio scrambler that is on, the radio scrambling effect ceases immediately.large miniatures large figures cover 4 map squares. they cannot move sideways. each square of forward movement costs 1 mvp, and each square of backward movement costs 2 mvp. moving is only possible if both target squares are valid squares to move into. figures with a rotating cost icon on their character card must spend that many mvp to rotate either 90° or 180° in either direction. it cannot choose its facing for free at the end of a move, or when interrupted. large figures cannot use stairs (stairs up or down, sewer exits). they can, however, pass or stand on these squares. a character has los to a large figure if it has los to at least one of its 4 squares. to check los from a large figure, draw a straight line from one of the figure’s squares that contain a red or orange fire arc to the target, applying normal los rules. if a large figure is standing in a doorway, the door can no longer be closed, automatically or manually. a large figure on more than one floor tile receives the benefits and disadvantages of all the floor tiles. if a large figure standing on 2 or more floor tiles executes a search order, the player must announce which room he is searching before rolling dice. if an explosive weapon’s area of effect impacts more than one square of a large figure, the opponent who fired the explosive chooses the target square when rolling for damage. the figure suffers damage from an explosion only on one square. mammoth mk ii the mammoth’s special ability is destroying walls and doors. spend 1 cp and choose a target in the mammoth’s los and red fire arc: either a long wall section; up to 2 adjacent short wall sections; a large door (only one square need be targeted); a short wall section and an adjacent door; or 1 or 2 adjacent small doors. roll 3 yellow dice. if the result is 4 test points or more, remove any targeted doors and/or place long or short broken wall markers on any targeted walls as appropriate. defensive values of the targets are ignored. the mammoth’s ammunition supply is only limited by the number of broken wall markers available: when they run out, it can no longer shoot or use its special ability. capture to capture a character, execute a normal close combat order against an adjacent, wounded enemy character. announce this is an attempt to capture, not to inflict damage, before rolling the dice. the character attempting the capture is the captor. the target of the capture is the victim. if the damage rolled would have been sufficient to kill the victim, he is captured. if not, he is not captured. no actual damage is applied to the victim in any case. if the victim is successfully captured, place the victim’s figure on the captor’s character card and place a prisoner marker on his character card; he is now a prisoner. a prisoner has a weight value of 1 (check the captor’s weight allowance). the captor can take some or all of the prisoner’s equipment cards or markers if he does not exceed his weight allowance. equipment cards not taken are removed from the game, or go to the bottom of the search deck if the scenario uses search. prisoners a prisoner cannot execute orders, does not provide bonus cp during the initiative phase, cannot be assigned order tiles, cannot use his special ability, and cannot keep any equipment. he is treated like an equipment and can be transferred between friendly characters as long as the new captor’s weight limit is respected. a captor cannot carry more than one prisoner. a captor can voluntarily free a prisoner for 0 mvp when executing a move order. the freed prisoner is placed on any valid square adjacent to the captor. freeing a prisoner by killing the captor: as soon as a captor is dead, his prisoner becomes free and his figure is placed on the captor’s cadaver square (the player regaining control of the prisoner chooses his facing). remove the prisoner marker from his character card. equipment carried by the dead captor can be divided between the freed prisoner and any of the adjacent characters who rescued him. assassinating a prisoner: a captor can automatically kill his prisoner by executing a 1 cp close combat order( no die roll is necessary). place the prisoner’s character marker, with his face visible, on the captor’s square. freeing a prisoner by capturing the captor: if a captor is captured by another character, the prisoner is automatically freed, and the captor becomes a prisoner. its figure is placed on its new captor’s character card, and the freed prisoner figure is placed on the map in its place. all other rules for capturing and freeing a prisoner apply. capturing a large miniature if a large figure is successfully captured, it stays on the map. place a prisoner marker on the large figure’s character card and the captor takes the card. place the captor’s miniature on the large figure’s character card to symbolize that the captor is piloting it. the captor must stay inside the large figure if he wants to keep it as a prisoner. he can move (control) the large figure using the large figure’s movement value, and he takes on its armor value, close combat chart and weight allowance. he keeps his own life points, cp bonus, and maximum cp per turn. for all other character statistics, the captor decides whether to use his own or the large figure’s when needed. if the large figure has built-in weapons, the captor can use them, and he can trigger the large figure’s special ability as well as his own. other figures controlled by the captor’s controlling player can move through the large figure as long as it remains his prisoner. figures controlled by the player who originally controlled the large figure cannot move through the large figure as long as it remains a prisoner. if the captor inside the large figure is captured or killed, the large figure is automatically freed. if there is no captor inside the large figure at the end of any activation round, it is automatically freed. there can only be one captor inside the large figure but a transfer of captor can occur. this can only be done using a combined move order with 2 characters. one character moves out of the large figure and another one enters it during the same activation round. torture only salemites can torture prisoners to obtain spy points (sp). spend 1-4 cp on an interact order assigned to the captor. each cp spent for torture grants 1 black torture die. if the captor is carrying the torture kit he gains +2 torture dice. if he is in the torture chamber, he gains +2 torture dice. spy point icons on the rolled dice are used as normal; all other dice results are ignored. a captor can torture the same prisoner multiple times in the same activation round. a character friendly to the captor can take the prisoner from him to torture him more, and 2 captors can exchange their prisoners to take turns torturing them. there is no limit to how many times the prisoner can be tortured.combination when a character executes an order, other characters can use gold order sections so they can all collectively perform a combined order in a single activation round. all the combined characters executing the combined order must be controlled by the active player, and they must all must execute the same order type (move, close combat, shoot, interact, search, torture). characters cannot combine together to trigger a character’s special ability. the activated character is the one activated by the active player this activation round. the order section he executes can be of any color, but the color of the order sections executed by all other combined characters must be gold, and they must use previously assigned order tiles to participate in the combined order. you must spend at least 1 cp on each order section of each combined character (including the activated character). you can spend more than 1 cp on some characters if the corresponding order sections assigned to them allow for more than 1 cp. no character can exceed his maximum cp per turn. except in the case of a combined move, all dice granted by all combined characters executing a combined order are rolled all at once, adding all automatic bonuses if any. you must spend all the cp you wish to spend on all combined characters before starting the order’s actual execution. you can execute more than one combined order in the same activation round but each must be resolved independently. a combined order cannot be executed during an interrupt. a character can still execute a regular gold order by himself. combined move moves more than one character in the same activation round. the active player decides in which order to move, but he must complete the move of one character before moving another. each combined character moves according to the cp spent on his assigned order tile. each moving character can be subjected to a interruption duel, but only while it is his turn to move. combined close combat each combined character must be adjacent to the defender. if the defender is attacked on different arcs, the defender chooses which color arc to use: dark blue, light blue or grey. roll all combat dice granted by all combined characters, adding any automatic hits. if the defender rolls any critical hits, he decides how to distribute them among the attackers. combined shoot each combined character must have los to the same target and shoot at the same target. separately determine each shooter’s required range to the target. roll separately for each shooter to see if targeting is successful. for each that is successful, check whether the target is in the red or orange fire arc to determine combat dice and automatic hits. roll all combat dice granted by all combined characters, adding any automatic hits, and resolve damage normally. combined search all combined characters must be on the same floor tile. a large figure can be partly on the same room tile as the others. roll all black dice granted by all the combined characters, adding any automatic search points. search through the search deck as usual. only one equipment card can be taken. the active player chooses which character gets the card. if the black dice provide spy points, they can be converted into mp only if all combined characters are on foreign ground. if a floor tile’s special ability provides extra black dice, each combined character benefits from this bonus cumulatively.combined interact with equipment card one of the combined characters (the carrier) must be carrying the equipment. all others must be adjacent to him. if the ips condition is to spend 2 cp or more, only the carrier needs to spend the cp. all other combined characters need only spend 1 cp: each additional cp gives one extra die. if the ips condition asks to spend only cp from one faction, only characters of that faction can be combined to interact with this equipment. if the ips condition asks for a cadaver, the carrier must be immediately facing the cadaver. if the equipment’s effect is to be applied to a character, any one combined character can benefit; the active player chooses which. on any case the equipment card remains with its carrier. any marker left on the map is placed under the carrier. an effect triggered in a floor tile is triggered where the carrier is standing. an area of effect is triggered centered on the carrier. if a floor tile’s special ability provides extra yellow dice, each combined character standing on this tile benefits from this bonus cumulatively. combined interact with floor element if a floor element shows only one facing icon, you may not combine characters to interact with it. if there is more than one facing icon, each combined character must be standing on a facing icon, correctly facing the floor element. if a room has no facing icon, all combined characters must be standing in the room, but only one can benefit from the effect. if the ips condition is to spend 2 cp or more, only the activated character needs to spend the cp. all other combined characters need only spend 1 cp: each additional cp gives one extra die. combined torture only salemite characters can be involved in the torture. the prisoner’s captor must be one of the combined characters, and all other combined characters must be adjacent to the captor. each cp spent on each combined character’s interact order provides +1 torture die. each combined character in the torture chamber gains +2 additional torture dice. if a combined character has the torture kit, only he gains +2 torture dice. multiple levels a character standing on a stairs up/down tile can use one mvp to move directly to the corresponding stairs down/up tile on the connecting level. the square occupied by a figure standing on a stair tile is treated as a normal floor square, and other figures on the same level can have los to the figure. the figure can also have los to other figures on the same level, and the corresponding stair tile on the connecting level. a figure standing on a stair tile can be attacked in close combat by any enemy adjacent figures on the same level or by an enemy standing on the corresponding stair tile on the connecting level. when close combat occurs through stair tiles, there is no facing, and each controlling player may choose any close combat color arc. this is also applicable in the case of a combined close combat involving one character attacking through stair tiles. a figure standing on a stair tile can shoot at any enemy standing on the corresponding stair tile. the range is 1 square, and the target is always considered to be in the shooter’s orange fire arc, no matter the facing of each figure. if a stair tile is in an explosive weapon’s red damage zone, the aoe is applied as normal, and the effect extends only to the corresponding stair tile on the connecting level. when rolling for damage there, consider the square to be in the red zone."

4 of each level 2 building (bank, barracks and guild hall); 3 of each level 3 building (docks, fortress and theater), 2 of each level 4 building (cartographer, trade office and university); and 1 of each level 5 building (exchange, museum and parliament). each player chooses a color and takes 1 player board, plus 4 status markers and 30 population markers of their color. each player places their status markers on the 0 spaces of their status tracks. a random first player takes the first player marker. turn sequence the game consists of 7 rounds, each 4 phases in length. the player with the first player marker goes first, followed by the other players in clockwise order. during the first 3 phases each player can act only once, but during the action phase play continues around until all have passed. 1. build in turn order, each player must build 1 building. choose 1 building tile from those in the stockpile, and add it to an empty building space on your player board. your industry score determines your build level (as indicated on your player board). you may only choose a building from a build level equal to or lower than your current build level. if no such building remains, you may choose a building from the next highest build level). you may build duplicates of building you already have. you may not choose any build level 5 building if you have already built a level 5 building. if you build a building featuring icons (industry, culture, finance, politics), increase your score on the matching tracks on your player board.2. growth in turn order, each player gains population markers. add population markers from your supply to your harbor. your culture score determines your growth level (as indicated on your player board). each level shows the number of population markers added. if you do not have enough population markers in your supply, add as many as you can. 3. salary in turn order, each player performs payments. you perform a payment by returning a population marker from one of your buildings back to your harbor. your finance score determines your salary level (as indicated on your player board). each level shows the number of payments that it permits. if you have more population markers on buildings than permitted payments, you may choose which of the population markers will return to the harbor, and which will remain on buildings. if you have more permitted payments than population markers on buildings, all population markers are returned and the excess payments are lost. 4. action starting with the first player and going clockwise, each player performs 1 action at a time, until all players have passed. when you acquire asset cards and trade tokens with icons on them, immediately increase your score on the matching tracks on your player board. industry culture finance politics glory you may never trade or give cards or tokens to other players. you may not discard cards or tokens at will. once you pass, you may take no further actions this phase; the turn order continues, but your turn is skipped. once all players have passed, the round is over. basic actions are indicated by single icons, and mixed actions by 2 icons separated by a / (choose which of the actions to take) or a + (take one or both of the actions in either order: in the same region; or if drawing, from the same deck). there are 2 ways to take an action: a. activate a building activate one of your buildings by moving one of your population markers from your harbor to the empty activation circle of a building tile. then perform the action(s) featured on that tile. a building cannot be activated if it already has a population marker in its activation circle, or if it does not have an activation circle. b. spend a trade token trade tokens with blue backgrounds feature action icons. you may discard one from your harbor and perform the featured action. the actions ship move a population marker from your harbor to the shipping track of a region, taking the unclaimed space on the track farthest from the deck. take the trade token in that space as a reward and place it faceup in your harbor. you may still ship to a region even if the track there is full—place your marker beside the track and do not take a trade token as a reward. the europe & the mediterranean region cannot be shipped to. opening a region when the last unclaimed space on a region’s shipping track is taken, the region becomes open. the top card of the asset deck (the governor) is given to the player that placed the most population markers on the track. on a tie, the card is given to the player with the closest marker to the deck. when you receive a governor card, place it in either the free governor slot or in one of the normal card slots on your player board. immediately take the appropriate status track increases. once a region is open, occupy, draw, and attack actions may take place there. the europe & the mediterranean region is considered open from the start of the game.occupy move a population marker from your harbor to an unoccupied city, taking the trade token there as a reward and placing it faceup in your harbor. only cities in open regions may be occupied. to occupy a city you must have presence there: at least 1 population marker already in the region (in other cities or on/beside the shipping track). all players are always considered to have presence in the europe & the mediterranean region. controlling connections if you have population markers in both cities at either end of a connection, you are controlling that connection. the first player to control a given connection takes its trade token and places it faceup in their harbor. attack this action costs 2 population markers. remove a population marker from your harbor and place it in your supply. then select a city already occupied by an opponent’s population marker (it returns to its owner’s supply) and replace it with a second population marker from your harbor. you now occupy the city. only occupied cities can be attacked. to attack a city you must have presence there: at least 1 population marker already in the region (in other cities or on/beside the shipping track). all players are always considered to have presence in the europe & the mediterranean region. controlling connections connections can come under a player’s control as a result of the attack action. payment move a population marker from the activation space of one of your buildings back to your harbor, freeing both the building and the population marker for later use. a building cannot use its own payment action on itself. draw take the top asset card in an open region and place it faceup in one of your player board slots (if there are none available, place it nearby). take the appropriate status track increases. to draw a card from a region’s stack, you must have a number of population markers in the region (in cities or on/beside the shipping track) equal to or greater than the value of the card.you may hold as many cards as you wish, and they may be freely moved into and out of your player board slots. in the europe & the mediterranean region there are 2 decks, each numbered 0-5 (the 0 value cards require no markers to draw). in this region only population markers in cities count towards the ability to draw cards; all the cities in the region can count for either deck. abolition of slavery when this card in the europe & the mediterranean deck is first drawn by any player, all players must immediately set aside all slavery cards they hold, reducing status track markers to reflect the lost icons. the slavery cards are set facedown near the player’s player board (they do not count towards a player’s card limit) as a reminder that the player loses 1 glory point per card at the end of the game. any slavery cards left on the main board are immediately removed from the game. pass/discard once you pass, you may take no further actions this phase. your politics score determines your card limit: you must discard cards down to this limit, reducing status track markers to reflect the lost icons. if your card limit is reduced due to the loss of politics icons, you must continue to discard cards until your card limit is satisfied. you may also keep 1 bonus slavery card beyond your card limit, not exceeding the 5 card maximum (more than one slavery card may be kept, but only one card per player gets this bonus). you may also keep 1 ‘free’ governor card on your player board, which does not count towards your card limit or the 5 card limit. you are not limited to 1 governor card, and you are not forced to keep a held governor in the ‘free’ slot even if the slot is empty. governor cards in normal slots do count towards the card limit and the 5 card maximum. discarded cards are returned to their decks in the same order as they were set up. discarded slavery cards are set facedown near the player’s player board (they do not count towards a player’s card limit) as a reminder that the player loses 1 glory point per card at the end of the game. discarded governors are removed from the game. cards may be repositioned into any slots desired.end of the round players recalculate their status tracks to ensure they are correct, and fix any errors. pass the first player marker to the left, and begin the next round. if the seventh round was just completed (the building spaces became full during this build phase), the game is immediately over. game end and victory at the end of the seventh round, players tally their glory points. remove any remaining trade tokens from the board and the player boards. use these (glory side up) to help count points; each token represents 1 point. use the larger score chips for 10 and 50 points. 1. on each city in which you have a population marker, place a glory token to match glory icons on those cities. place 1 glory token on each connection you control. take all those glory tokens. 2. status markers on spaces without icons are pushed down to the first space they reach that does have an icon. add up the points from your status tracks and take that many glory tokens. 3. add up the glory icons on your cards and take that many glory tokens. 4. if you do not have governor card in your ‘free’ governor space, take 3 glory tokens. 5. for each university you have, take 3 glory tokens. 6. for every 3 population markers remaining in your harbor, take 1 glory token. 7. if you have discarded slavery cards by your player board, lose 1 glory token per card. the winner is the player with the most glory points. on a tie, all tied player share the victory. other notes token storage: you may stack your brown trade tokens on their status tracks to save room; keep the stacks on the number that matches the height of the stack. phase order: alternatively, each player may individually complete the first 3 phases in order before passing to the next player in turn order. this assists in individual planning and speeds up the game. track limit: if a score on a status track rises above 15, the marker stays at 15. but if you lose icons, be sure that your marker is positioned to reflect your actual total of held icons."

track by the same amount, respectively. resolve the awakening card starting from step 4. after placing the 2 starting/setup slumber map tiles (labelled on the back), place your dreamers in any of the spaces. during this time, players may change their dreamer, their influence deck composition, and which masks they want to make active. if this is your first game, take and resolve tile 1-01x (the first dream gate tile). basics dreams are confined larger adventures, while slumbers are shorter mini encounters between them. dreams use dreamscape map tiles. slumbers use slumber (dreamscape) map tiles and the slumber deck. the group of dreamers navigate the dreamworld map to gain passage into dreams, encountering slumbers along the way. reveal: when you are instructed to reveal a card or tile with a specific code, find it in the secret deck/tiles, reveal it, and place it in the corresponding slot (or nearby game board if it doesn’t have a designated slot). if you are only given a letter instead of a full code, the revealed card/tile comes from the current dream instead of the secret deck/tiles.secret scripts: when you are given a reference to s. ####, turn to that number in the book of secret scripts and read it aloud. multiple choices: when you are instructed to do something and there are several applicable options, the dreamers choose an option as a group. if you do not satisfy the requirements to make a certain choice, you may not choose it (this applies to the whole group if the choice is directed to all the dreamers). player count icon: this icon is always equal to the number of players in the game. hand size limit: you can never have more than 6 cards in hand at any time. when drawing cards, you only draw until you have 6 cards in hand, never more. a bonus that allows you to draw more cards does not increase your hand size limit. luck die: the effect of a luck die roll is indicated on the appropriate component. if a result isn’t stated, nothing happens. rerolls: there is no limit to the number of rerolls you can perform, as long as you can meet the conditions and pay all costs. only the result of the last roll is applied; previous results are ignored. range: an action/effects may have a maximum range. they can always target spaces that are closer than this range. range 0 means the same space. range 1 means an adjacent space and/or closer spaces. in any range or unlimited range doesn’t mean you may affect spaces behind walls or blocked spaces. if a rule states in any space, you may ignore range, walls and blocked spaces. dreams dream gate tiles to enter a dream: 1. if the slumber dreamscape (tiles, quirks etc) is present, discard it first. 2. resolve all the setup steps on the dream gate tile before beginning the dream. usually this means taking all the appropriate cards out of the box and setting up the starting dreamscape map tiles. never look at the front side of any secret card or tile unless instructed to reveal, peek or gain it. 3. randomly draw the listed number of turn cards and place them faceup in the turn deck slot. this determines how much time you have to complete the dream. discard the rest facedown to the turn discard pile. 4. read the introduction within the book of secret scripts for this specific dream. 5. flip the dream gate tile to its other side and place it on the dream gate slot. any special rules are listed here along with the goal of the dream, and the script number to resolve if you run out of turns. 6. the dreamers enter the dreamscape and the first turn begins. the dreamscape map when a map tile is revealed, turn it faceup and align the tile’s code with the corresponding code on the game board on the dreamscape map area. map tiles or cards do not always occupy a whole map tile slot: check the code of the tile is aligned with the code on the game board and the grid lines match up. map actions are found on map tiles. those with the symbol are single use only: after using the action, block it with a token. dreamers always enter the dreamscape on the dreamer’s entrance. this icon is placed between 2 spaces, and you may place miniatures in either of these spaces. drawing bonus: at the start of the dreamers phase during the draw step, if you’re in a space with a drawing bonus, draw a number of additional influence cards equal to the number shown (your hand size limit does not change).spawned entities appear in these spaces. if several of these spaces are available, you can choose one. when spawning several entities, if there is more than 1 space available allocate them as evenly as possible. if there is any spawn space with a turn suit icon, see if it corresponds to the current turn suit on the current turn card. if it does, the first spawned entity must be placed in that corresponding space. shining gem slots: when you’re in this space, you may spend 1 and place it in this slot. from now on, the effect described next to that slot is active. you may use this action without paying additional costs. if you’re in a space with an active slot you may recover that but, will also deactivate the slot’s effect. trap: whenever you move through this space (or end movement/relocation on it), trigger the trap effect described in the slumber/dream. terrain symbols or terrain tokens don’t have any effect unless another card or rule directly addresses them. when a terrain symbol is at the center of a map tile, all 4 spaces on the tile are considered as having that symbol. if a terrain symbol is on the line between 2 spaces of a map tile, both spaces are considered as having that symbol. whenever there are both and terrain symbols in the same space at the same time, ignore the symbol. walls are impassable barriers that neither entities or dreamers may move through or measure range through. if you want to move to a space behind a wall (or use an action targeting that space), you have to measure the range around it. if a wall doesn’t cover the entire edge of their space, the wall on that edge is disabled. if 2 adjacent tiles show a tiny gap between their walls, just on their edges, these gaps don’t disable the wall. blocked space (red border): entities and dreamers may not move or measure range through a blocked space. if you want to move to a space behind a blocked space (or use an action targeting that space), you must measure the range around it (if possible). space and component limits each space is full when it holds 4 miniatures and/or entity tokens. dreamers can move through full spaces, but cannot stop on them. entities entering full spaces (by moving or spawning) causes dreamers to be pushed out to any adjacent space chosen by the players. however if the full space contains only 1 dreamer, that dreamer cannot be pushed and the entity ends its movement within range 1 of the space. big entities occupy the whole space in which they stand and cannot be pushed out in any way. when a big entity enters a space, it ends its movement and pushes all other miniatures and/ or entity tokens in that space to any adjacent spaces chosen by the players. in some dreams, spaces are completely cut off by walls. the dreamers may be able to relocate to these spaces in various ways. if 4 dreamers occupy such a space, no entity can spawn or relocate there. whenever you should gain or place a component and there are not enough left in the pool, that component is not gained/placed. however, if a dreamer should suffer and there are none left in the pool, all dreamers lose. the number of components of a given type is not dependent on the numbers of dreamers. this applies to any component gained from the secret cards of a dream. if you already found a special item in a dream, that item won’t be there anymore if you visit that dream again; you do not gain a second copy of that item.turn order gameplay is divided into turns, each of which consists of a dreamers phase (where the players act simultaneously) followed by a dreamscape phase (where the game acts). dreamers phase 1. dra w step each dreamer draws 4 influence cards, not exceeding their hand size limit (6 cards). if you reach your hand limit, stop drawing. at no time can you have more cards than this limit. if you can draw, you cannot choose to draw fewer cards than required. before you draw you may discard any number of cards from your hand. if at any time you have to draw cards but the deck is empty, reshuffle your discard pile and create a new influence deck. then you must suffer 1 or seal 3 cards. if the game allows you to reshuffle your influence deck, even though you still have some cards in it, reshuffle all the remaining cards and the cards in your discard pile to form a new influence deck. in this case you do not have to take the reshuffle penalty. 2. card and action step dreamers move across the dreamscape, perform actions and play cards. dreamers can take their actions simultaneously without worrying about player order unless a specific situation calls for it. this phase ends when all players agree there is nothing more to do. dreamscape phase 1. entity and dream event step check the current turn card and resolve each step from top to bottom: morphing effects (blue), basic effects (yellow), special effects (red), and an entity movement step . if the card specifies an effect but there are no game elements where it is featured, skip that effect. if several effects happen in the same step, resolve them in any order, but they are considered to have happened simultaneously. if you are instructed to do something at the end of the turn, do it after resolving all steps. dreamers cannot use any actions or card effects during this phase unless a card specifically allows it or there is a special icon on it. 2. discard turn step discard the current turn card. all effects with until the end of this turn timing cease to be in effect now. then, if there are cards remaining in the turn order deck, a new turn begins. if no cards remain, resolve the out of turns effect on the dream gate/slumber tile. delta phase when you resolve the last green-colored slumber tile, this is the delta phase. dreamers may: • cure all their . • unseal all their cards. • unflip all their progress cards. • reshuffle their influence deck. • restore their mask. hours are reset according to the number of players – 1/2/3/4/5 players = 5/4/3/2/1 hours respectively. then, shuffle all of the other discarded slumber tiles and place them on top of this tile again to begin the cycle anew. the slumber dreamscape map remains unchanged.sealing & unsealing cards seal x cards: reveal x influence cards from the top of your deck and place them in the sealed pile. sealed cards are unavailable until you manage to recover them through an unseal effect. unseal x cards: take x cards from the top of your sealed pile and place them in your discard pile. they will become available again after you reshuffle your deck. place your sealed pile below your dreamer board to mark those cards as unavailable. only influence cards can be sealed. other cards in your deck are omitted while sealing (you just skip the card and draw another card). after resolving the seal effect, any drawn card is placed back on the top of the deck. if you need to seal cards, but you do not currently have any in your influence deck, you do not need to reshuffle nor seal your cards. dreamer actions while in a slumber/dream, each dreamer may perform actions. most can be found on the basic actions card, on the dreamer’s influence cards, on the active dreamer’s progress cards, on the dreamer’s active mask, or on the active items shared by the team. to perform an action, pay its cost by discarding a combination of influence cards from your hand and/or active items until you reach the required amount of the particular type of intent. awareness: related to conversation, observation, understanding, and technology. cunning. related to movement, cleverness, avoidance, acting, and deception. wrath: related to physical effort, fighting, tenacity, or arguing. discard influence cards to a personal influence discard pile, and discard items used in this way into the item storage. if a card has multiple intent colors to choose from, you must choose which one you want to use when discarding it. if you are discarding a card in this way you may not use its printed action ability. intent is gained immediately when discarding the card and any excess intent is lost. the cost of this action is always 0 intent. using it is free. suffer the shown amount of to pay this cost (gain ). to use this action, you must discard the given amount of . map actions can only be carried out if the dreamer’s miniature is in that action’s space, however assault or contact actions are can be performed from a base assault/contact range of 1 space away. you can multiply the effect of an assault/contact action by paying its cost multiple times (you can choose a different target for each effect). boosting your intent once per turn, when you spend at least 1 intent (even if it’s less than the required cost) to pay for any action, you may then decide to roll the luck die to add additional intent to this action. the action is failed and you don’t reclaim discarded influence cards used to pay for this action. additionally, discard 1 or suffer 1 or seal 3 cards. no intent is added. if this means that the action fails, you don’t reclaim discarded influence cards used to pay for this action. add 1/2/3 intent of the same color.after rolling the die, you can’t add any more intent to this action. if you fail to gather the required number of intent, the used intent is lost, even though you didn’t perform the action. basic actions move: spend any number of to move the same number of spaces. effort: once a turn, lose x hours to move x spaces. peek a card: discard 1 card to take a 5 second peek at 1 secret card/tile from the current dream with an influence, item, flaw, fate, or slumber back. gain a shining gem: discard 3 influence cards from your hand to gain 1 . use a shining gem: discard 1 to reroll any roll (of any die, rolled by any player). remove morphings: discard 1 key or 1 to discard 1 morphing from an entity within range 1. return removed morphings to the morphing pool. movement actions perform a move action by discarding either influence cards or active item cards with intent, and then moving the dreamer as many spaces as there were intent on them. movement is usually only orthogonal (vertical or horizontal), not diagonal. relocating means moving to another space, ignoring range, walls, and any other obstacles. you may also use the luck die when performing a movement action to move farther. it counts only as 1 movement. if the roll is failed, you do not move at all. gradual actions gradual actions scale with the number of dreamers and are marked by this icon after the basic cost to indicate how many times that cost must be paid to perform it. they may be paid in several steps over several turns. each time the basic cost is paid, place an intent marker near the action. if the cost is given in 2 intent colors, choose an intent color and pay the full cost using that color. the notation xx means a higher action cost, not a gradual action that you may pay in steps. return all intent markers to the pool after the action is performed. intent markers are limited; if you need one of a specific color but there aren’t enough left, you may take an intent marker from another action. any intent marker placed on an action is considered to be yours, even if it was placed by another dreamer. when there are several miniatures of a given type of entity in play, intent markers placed on the entity tile are not assigned to any of the miniatures. they are only assigned (and then discarded) to a specific miniature when the gradual action is actually performed. turn cards block 1 step of the current turn card: choose and mark one of the steps with a : skip that step when resolving the turn card. add 1 turn: take the bottom card of the turn discard pile and place it at the bottom of the turn deck. loot: resolve the current turn card’s loot section whenever you are instructed you to gain loot. if a slumber tile tells you to gain loot after the last turn card has been discarded, check the loot section on that last discarded turn card. entity movement entities move during the entity movement step on turn cards. each entity has its own movement value on its entity tile. roll the entity movement die separately for each entity (though you may choose to roll once for all entities if you prefer):the entity moves 1 space only. the entity moves the number of spaces indicated by its movement value. the entity moves its movement value, then roll again and resolve the new roll. the entity ignores the movement die. this may be followed with additional rules concerning that specific entity. entities always move toward the closest dreamer unless stated otherwise. if several dreamers are closest, players decide how the entity moves. if it is already in a space with a dreamer and performs a movement, or it does not have a legal path to its target, it does not move. entities do not use map actions. when an entity enters the targeted dreamer’s space, it stops its move. morphings morphings add a boost to the entity, making it stronger as long as the token is on its tile. when you add any morphing tokens (during the blue morphing step on turn cards) draw them randomly from an opaque container and place them faceup on the entity tile. each entity effect that inflicts inflicts 1 additional . each entity effect that seals your cards, seals 2 additional cards. entity movement is raised by 2. when you roll , it still only moves 1 space. all entity effects with range have that range increased by 1 space. all masks worn by the dreamers are inactive. all effects are applied immediately. all placed progress cards are inactive. all effects are applied immediately. new ones can be placed but remain inactive. dreamers cannot reroll dice results in any way. dreamers cannot use their for rerolls (but can gain more), however they can still pay for effects that cost . cards influence cards and items are most often used in slumbers and dreams, not on the dreamworld map. to use them, you must have them in your hand or as active progress cards. other cards can also be played if they have an immediate effect that is useful on the dreamworld map or when resolving a fate card. if you can find a use for an influence card or an item, you may use it on the dreamworld map. influence cards influence cards represent all the abilities and powers in the dreamers’ physical and psychological arsenals. during the campaign, each dreamer’s starting influence deck will improve and evolve as they gain new cards by visiting dreams or buying them from the influence market. each dreamer places their deck on the left side of their dreamer board and they will draw cards from this deck during the game. played and discarded cards are placed faceup in the discard pile, on the right side of the board. except for progress cards, you may only play influence cards from your hand either for their intent or for their action/effect. unless specified otherwise, you can only play influence cards during the dreamers phase. cards with the rapid icon are an exception to this rule. they can be played at any time during your action (even in the middle of another action), other dreamers’ rounds, or during the dreamscape phase (be sure to pay their costs before doing so).some cards have additional requirements before you can use their actions or effect. each starting influence deck has its own special character action on the back of each card. dreamers may perform this action when the card is on the top of their deck. place gained influence cards (from dreams and the influence market) faceup on top of the dreamer’s discard pile. progress influence cards progress cards are special influence cards that provide persistent abilities when they are played. they can be used normally for intent when discarded from your hand but the actions/effects on them cannot be used until they are placed into your progress zone (beneath your dreamer board) by paying the listed cost on the top of the card. from then on, you may use any action or effect on this card. once played, an active progress card cannot be discarded to use as intent. each dreamer may have a maximum of 4 progress cards in their progress zone (some masks and other cards may modify this). if you want to place a new progress card when you have already reached your limit, you must first discard one of your placed cards (active or flipped) before you can place the new one. you cannot voluntarily discard a placed progress card otherwise. if you are instructed to flip a progress card, turn it facedown. the card’s action can no longer be used until it is unflipped, but the card still counts toward your placed progress cards limit. icon rules refer to the number of your active progress cards of the corresponding color (flipped cards do not count). unless otherwise specified, progress cards are not discarded when used. placed progress cards remain in your progress zone until an effect forces you to discard them. you may have 2 identical active progress cards, but most of them will not duplicate their own effect. the influence market the influence market is a pool of unacquired influence cards available to the dreamers when they go shopping on the dream world map. they should be taken out of the box only when required. when you are instructed to buy influence cards, each dreamer may draw the top 3 cards of the influence market and buy any number of them with their available , placing them faceup on top of your discard pile. return any remaining cards to the bottom of the market. the cost of each influence card is indicated in its upper right corner. if you draw a starting card of another dreamer, you may buy the card and start using the special action on its back, even though you are not that dreamer. when the game asks you to return a card to the influence market, remove it from your deck and put it at the bottom of the influence market. influence deck card limits during the deckbuilding step (only), check that you’re within the deck limit of 20-40 cards. if you have less than 20, you must add all your available cards to your deck, and if you have more than 40, return excess cards to the box, in the slot dedicated to your dreamer. these unused cards cannot be used in the game until the next deckbuilding step. during the deckbuilding step, you must add all your flaw cards to your influence deck (they do not count toward the 20-40 limit). wisdom cards wisdom cards you gain are always active. place them in their card holder, which can hold up to 18 cards (9 per side). if you have more, players may choose which cards to keep in the card holder, but all cards are still active. fate cards when you enter a location, draw a fate card from the top of the fate deck and resolve it. if it asks you to draw and place a slumber dreamscape map tile, after doing so, if any map tile on the board has an empty quirk space, place this fate card into that space (if there is more than 1 empty space, choose any of them). otherwise, discard the fate card to the bottom of the fate deck. fate cards with quirks on them (or quirk cards) create opportunities for certain spaces on the map, or negative/positive effects for the whole dreamscape. fla w cards when you draw a flaw card, put it on the top of your discard pile. whenever you draw a flaw card from your influence deck, you must resolve it immediately. some are placed into your discard pile or into your progress zone, applying a persistent negative effect (these are not counted toward the active progress card limit). most flaw cards can be removed from your deck for a price, after which they are returned to the bottom of the flaw deck. flaw cards are omitted when having to seal cards and are then placed back on top of your influence deck. overlay cards overlay cards, secret cards which contain parts of the dream map, are immediately placed on the dreamscape when revealed. when an overlay card is placed in the dreamscape, it cannot be removed unless the game specifically allows you to do so. overlay cards must be placed very precisely. when you place an overlay card, any miniature/token/marker occupying its dedicated spot is placed on the top of the overlay card in the same place. note cards note cards are usually one-use cards which can be used in a specific situation or in a particular dream. all note cards gained are kept in the storage and can be used by any dreamer. season cards season cards alter some rules when you are traversing the dreamworld. generally, positive seasons occur if you complete dreams with a victory, and failing a dream causes a negative season to occur. dying does not cause seasons to change. items there can only be a maximum of 3 active items, placed in their designated spaces on the board (there is a 4th slot that may be unlocked). any dreamer can use these by discarding them for their intent or using them for their effects (though items are not discarded after using their effect unless specifically stated). all other item cards owned by dreamers are not considered to be active but placed facedown in the storage slot. when you are allowed to restore an item, draw 1 randomly from the storage and place it in an active item slot. if there are no slots available, discard one of your other active items or the item you just drew back into the storage (some go back to the item market). masks each dreamer may only wear 1 active mask at a time, normally chosen at the start of each game session (place it in a plastic stand). the ability on its back may be used at any time. if the mask’s action can be used once per turn, you may place it at the top of your deck after using it as a reminder, and remove it at the beginning of the next turn during the draw step.when you are instructed to restore a mask, replace your active mask with one of your other masks (or if both masks were discarded, make one of them active). when you are instructed to discard a mask you lose it: place it either back in the box or off to the side. you may choose to place your sealed cards underneath or atop discarded masks. when you gain a new mask you may immediately wear it, discarding your current active mask. use the ii-41 s secret cards representing your dreamers’ masks to remind which dreamer owns which mask from game to game. shopping at a shopping location you may use your shopping card (11-41c) to allow each dreamer to choose one of these options: 1. buy influence cards: draw 3 cards from the influence market deck and buy as many of these as they wish by paying the cost in the top right of the card. place these cards to your personal discard pile. any unbought cards are placed at the bottom of the market deck. 2. buy 1 item: draw a random item from the item market and gain it for 2 , placing it in an active item slot (discard one if full). if you don’t buy any cards or items gain 1 . return the shopping card back to the secrets afterwards. a w akening awakening is a recovery/reset mechanic discovered when you have completed the first dream. it allows dreamers the opportunity to completely remove their distress and sealed cards, albeit at the cost of obtained keys, , and placed progress cards. dreamers will awaken at the awakening location on the dreamworld suburbia district. this can be resolved at any moment after resolving the location effect on the dreamworld map. see the awakening wisdom card for the steps involved. during this resolution players are able to change their dreamers, change their influence deck composition, and choose between their available masks which one to make active. dreamworld map starting with your team marker on the awakening space, you will move around following the big arrows until you reach other locations with map icons. unlike gameplay within dreams/ slumbers, there are no set turns on the dreamworld map and movement between the big arrows is free. smaller arrows are more dangerous shortcuts. when moving using a shortcut, each dreamer must seal 1 card. the description of all icons on the dreamworld map can be found on the dreamworld map wisdom card, which becomes available after finishing the first dream. traverse these paths to gain more keys to enter dream gates, and prepare your dreamers for the upcoming dreams by completing slumbers (placing progress cards, obtaining and ). slumbers slumbers are mini-encounters you will discover when moving around the dreamworld, drawn from a slumber tile deck. at the end of the first dream and for each subsequent game following, set up this deck by placing all the slumber tiles you have accumulated throughout the course of the game on top of the green-backed delta phase slumber tile. whenever the game asks you to add a new slumber tile to the slumber deck, add it to the bottom of that deck.slumber entity encounters mostly occur on the slumber dreamscape map. during awakening and after concluding every dream, clear the dreamscape of any dream map tiles and place the 2 starting/setup slumber dreamscape map tiles. shuffle the rest of the unlocked slumber dreamscape map tiles and place them facedown on their relevant space on the board; these will be drawn and placed as fate card effects. slumber entity tiles setup: turns: set up the miniature(s) and create a turn deck with the specified number of turn cards: this is how much time you have to complete the encounter. if you run out of turns, perform the out of turns/skip effect. out of turns/skip: if the slumber entity has a skip effect, the dreamers may decide, at the start of any turn, to resolve the out of turns effect instead of playing that slumber. if this effect does not take into account any element placed during the setup, the dreamers may decide to skip the slumber even before it has started (this may give the dreamers a negative penalty). gain loot: resolve the loot section of the current turn card. this slumber ends: the slumber ends immediately. discard the current slumber tile to the bottom of the slumber deck and all entity tokens/markers/miniatures related to that slumber back to the box. slumber map tiles, quirk cards, tokens, or markers not associated with the current slumber tile remain. dreamer miniatures remain in the spaces where they are at the end of the slumber and start there in the next slumber. the next slumber begins with everything as it is now. now, go back to the dreamworld map. states when dreamers or entities gain a state, place the appropriate state token next to the targeted miniature/entity. if there are none left in the pool, the effect is ignored. dazed: the maximum range of entity effects/dreamer actions is reduced to 1 to until the end of the turn/ dreamers phase. stunned: any caused by effects of the stunned target are ignored for this turn. paralyzed: the affected entity/dreamer is unable to move/relocate until the end of the turn/dreamers phase. poisoned: the affected entity is unable to gain newer morphings until the end of the dream/slumber. distress and dying marks distress, fear, fatigue, doubts and wounds; place them next to your dreamer board. dreamers lose the game when any dreamer suffers an 8th they die, and all dreamers lose. whenever a dreamer should suffer , but there are none left in the pool (there are a total of 16 markers), all dreamers lose. when a dreamer has fewer than 6 cards (including cards in their influence deck, hand, and discard pile, but not active progress cards and sealed cards) they die and all dreamers lose. if the dreamers lose, resolve the death wisdom card (reveal ii-42 i secret card if it is not revealed yet). if dreamers lose in a dream, they discard the current dreamscape and return all of its cards and tiles (except for those already gained by dreamers or added to the game decks) to the secrets. keep the dream gate tile of this dream so you may try again.sa ving the game after resolving any location effects on the dreamworld map, you may pause and save your campaign. to not lose the you have collected, you may resolve a buying influence cards step once. then, if any dreamer has remaining they discard all their remaining and gain 1 secret card ii-41 r (which allows you to gain 1 when you setup the next game). carry out steps 1-3 of the awakening wisdom card: 1. discard all influence cards (from deck, hand and progress zone). 2. cure all and unseal all cards. 3. discard all keys and . then, place the rest of the cards and tiles in their corresponding slots in the box (using the proper dividers): • each dreamer’s deck with their basic action cards and mask cards (ii-41 s). • all team cards from the storage. • the turn deck, flaws deck, slumber map deck, fate deck, slumber deck, and seasons deck (keep the active season card at the top). • dream gate tiles should be placed in the special envelope. • sign tokens that are still available. • separate and store remaining components in bags. if you are within a dream when you decide to do this you must treat it as a death of a dreamer (secret card ii-42 i). adding a new dreamer if the last session was played with fewer than 4 dreamers and a new player wants to join the game, they pick an unused dreamer archetype and join the adventure. if it’s the other way around, just play without the absentees. if a player cannot participate in the session, their dreamer can be handled by a new player (provided the original player agrees). v ariants the thorn knight: the knight’s wisdom card is active from the start of the game and details it contains all rules needed to use it. classic card rules: once per dream, the team may use a deck of poker cards to influence one effect listed below. shuffle and draw 3 cards: these are luck cards. with these decide whether you want to back out or try your luck. if you do, draw 3 more cards: these are drawback cards. if the sum (a jack is 11, a queen 12, a king 13, an ace 14, and a joker 15) of the luck cards is higher than the sum of the drawback cards resolve the positive effect, otherwise resolve the negative one (depending on which effect you tried to influence): morphings positive: discard all morphings on an entity negative: add 2 morphings on an entity. positive: gain all available (distribute between dreamers). negative: dreamers discard all . hours positive: add 2 hours. negative: lose all hours. positive: any 1 dreamer cures . negative: any 1 dreamer suffers . sealing cards positive: each dreamer unseals 5 cards. negative: each dreamer seals 5 cards.

faceup in a row near the map to form the shop. randomly choose a first player and move the agenda deck to their right side. starting with that player and going clockwise, each player chooses a survivor and takes the corresponding figure, character card, and s.p.e.c.i.a.l. token marked with that character’s silhouette. place your figure in an unoccupied space on the crossroads camp map tile. each player takes a player board and places a green peg in the 0 hole, a red peg in the 16 hole, and a gray peg in the hole to the left of the xp track. also place your starting s.p.e.c.i.a.l. token in its corresponding slot on the player board, then draw 1 additional s.p.e.c.i.a.l. token at random and place it in its slot. if you already have that one, randomly draw a different one instead. each player draws 1 agenda card, keeping it secret, and takes 3 caps from the supply. resolve any effects on the scenario sheet or other components that resolve at the start of the game. if any enemy tokens are displayed on the map, place 1 random enemy token of the corresponding type faceup in each of those spaces. place the and power tokens on the topmost space of the power track on the scenario sheet. game round take turns in clockwise order, starting with the first player. after all players have taken a turn, enemies on the map activate and attack, and then a new round begins with the first player taking another turn. during your turn, you may perform up to 2 actions, and may perform the same action (except the encounter action) multiple times. you can can skip one or both of the actions if desired.explore action perform an explore action when you are in a space that is adjacent to a facedown map tile to flip that tile faceup. orient the tile with the arrow pointing in the same direction as the arrow on the starting tile. for each enemy icon on the tile, draw a random enemy of the matching type and place it faceup in the space with the icon. if there were any enemies on the tile when it was facedown, place those enemies in the spaces of your choice on the tile after it is flipped faceup. move action take a move action to gain 2 movement points (mps). each point can be spent to move your figure into an adjacent space. you can interrupt your move action to perform another action. if you perform 2 move actions, you can combine the mps and spend them together. moving into a difficult terrain space (red border) requires an additional mp. the 2 mps used to enter the space don’t need to come from the same action. if you move into an irradiated terrain space (green border) you suffer 1 rad. quest action you cannot perform the quest action while in the same space as a faceup enemy. perform a quest action to attempt to complete a quest objective . you can attempt to complete a quest only if you meet the requirement after the . execute any listed instructions in the quest requirement. if you succeed, you complete the objective. if a quest instructs you to place a quest marker, take a pair of matching quest marker tokens, place one on the map as indicated and the other on the quest card. when the card is trashed, discard both quest markers. encounter action you cannot perform the encounter action while in the same space as a faceup enemy. perform an encounter action when in a space marked with an encounter icon (wasteland , settlement , or vaults ) to resolve an encounter card from the matching deck. you can perform this action at each encounter icon only once per turn. the player to your right draws the encounter card and reads the intro and the bold text next to each numbered arrow. then you choose one of the options and execute all the instructions after that option. if an option involves a task, attempt to perform the task. resolve the succeed result if you succeed at the task or kill the enemy, and the fail result if you do not. some options have conditions that must be met in order to choose that option. if a bold text section starts with forced, and the following condition is met, instead of being allowed to choose an option you must resolve that section. you cannot choose to resolve that section if the condition is not met.if an encounter is not trashed after being resolved, return it to the bottom of the corresponding deck. when resolving an encounter at a location with a level, treat any instances of the encounter icon on the card as a number equal to the level of the card’s encounter icon. encounters at vault spaces cannot be performed until the corresponding deck is added to the game. fight action when in a space with an active enemy, perform a fight action to fight that enemy. if multiple enemies are in your space, choose one. if your equipped weapon has the ranged icon, you can perform this action to fight an enemy in an adjacent space. if that enemy does not have the icon, you inflict 1 additional hit . resolve the following steps: 1. roll the 3 v.a.t.s. dice. 2. reroll dice: for each s.p.e.c.i.a.l. token on your weapon that matches a token that you have, generate 1 reroll. you can then spend each reroll one at a time to reroll any number of the 3 v.a.t.s. dice. 3. resolve enemy hits: for each hit shown on the dice, suffer damage equal to the level of the enemy, first reducing the total number of by the armor value of all armor you have equipped. 4. resolve survivor hits: spend dice results to inflict hits. for each die result on which there is one or more filled-in (green) area that matches a filled-in (green) area on the enemy, you inflict 1 . if you inflict a number of hits equaling or exceeding the enemy’s level, the enemy is killed. 5. gain xp: if you killed the enemy, gain xp equal to the enemy’s level. regardless of whether you do or do not kill the enemy, the fight is over. when instructed to draw and fight an enemy, draw an enemy of that type from the supply, fight it, and then discard the enemy token. if doing this as part of a quest or encounter, you succeed only if you kill the enemy. abilities with the during a fight timing can be used during any step of a fight. abilities with the before a fight timing must be used before rolling v.a.t.s. dice. each s.p.e.c.i.a.l. token on your equipped weapon counts as tokens used for the fight for card abilities. if cards give additional uses for rerolls, they must be used during the reroll dice step of a fight unless otherwise stated. when an enemy is killed, discard its token. then draw a new token of the same type is from the supply and place it facedown in the space with a matching enemy icon that is closest to the space from which the other enemy was discarded. if there are several matching spaces, the first player chooses which one. if you are killed and the enemy isn’t, the enemy remains active and in the space. hits inflicted on an enemy do not carry over from fight to fight.camp action you cannot perform the camp action while in the same space as a faceup enemy. you may do all of the following in any order: recover 3 hp, unexhaust all of your exhausted cards, gain the well rested trait, and trade with any other survivors in your space or an adjacent space. all exhausted cards must be unexhausted. to trade, exchange any number of items, companions, agendas, and caps. both parties must agree to the trade. promises may be traded, but they are not binding. other game elements such as traits, s.p.e.c.i.a.l. tokens, perks, or the ghoul’s starting card cannot be traded. agenda cards involved in a trade can be shown to the other survivor before a trade. end of the round after all players have taken their turns, reveal the top card of the agenda deck, resolve the enemy icons shown along the bottom of the card, then discard it. ignore all the text. from left to right, for each enemy icon, move each enemy of that type 1 space toward the nearest survivor, ignoring terrain. they can move across facedown map tiles, treating them as a single space. if, before moving, that enemy is either in the same space as a survivor or adjacent to a survivor and has the icon, the enemy fights that survivor instead. if there is a tie for the closest survivor, the enemy moves toward or attacks the survivor with the lowest hp. on a further tie, choose the tied player that acts earlier in turn order. after all active enemies of a type have activated, flip all inactive enemies of that type faceup. inactive enemies are facedown. you cannot look at, fight or use an ability to target an inactive enemy, and they do not stop you from performing actions in their space. when an enemy fights a survivor, that survivor and the enemy resolve a fight as if that survivor had performed a fight action. if multiple enemies attack you, you choose the order in which the attacks resolve. drawing the last agenda card when the last agenda card is drawn, shuffle the discards to create the new agenda deck and pass it to the player to the right of the first player. that player is now the first player. whose turn it is and whose turn is next does not change. finally, advance both faction tokens 1 space down the track on the scenario sheet. play continues with the next player in turn order. the round will end, and the next agenda card will be drawn, before the new first player’s next turn. performing tests to perform a test, roll the 3 v.a.t.s. dice and count the number of hit icons. if the number equals or exceeds the difficulty of the test, you succeed. if you have any s.p.e.c.i.a.l. tokens that match those used by the test, you can reroll any number of dice before the final results of the test are resolved. you can perform 1 such reroll for each s.p.e.c.i.a.l. token that matches one used by the test."
92,138161,FIREFLY: THE GAME,2013,GALE FORCE NINE,2.9543,525,"setup in a game with 3 or more players, place the alliance cruiser and reaver cutter cards in their respective nav deck discard piles. when either deck becomes exhausted for the first time, reshuffle the discard pile.subsequently, reshuffle the deck every time a reshuffle card is drawn and resolved. place the alliance cruiser in the londinium sector. commander harken is aboard. place the reaver cutter in the sector that contains the firefly logo. place the set up cards faceup in the middle of the board. all players roll a die. the highest roller selects a leader, ship card and the appropriate starting drive core. place the drive core in the main drive slot of your ship card. going clockwise, each player in turn makes their leader selections. the last player to choose places his firefly on the map in any sector, then players take turns placing their fireflys in reverse order. you may not place your firefly in a sector occupied by another player. the last player to place their firefly takes the first game turn. play then proceeds clockwise. choose a story card and return the rest to the box; the chosen card may effect the rest of the setup. each player takes 3000 credits, 6 fuel and 2 parts. place your starting fuel and parts on empty cargo or stash areas of your ship card. each takes up half a space; you can have a fuel and a part sharing a space. each player takes a job card from each contact deck. you may not have more than 3 job cards in your hand at any given time. you may discard any job you don’t want, and must discard down to 3 cards. flip over the top 3 cards of each supply deck, placing them in their discard pile and noting as each is revealed. when you must discard a card, place the card in the discard pile of the appropriate deck. when you must remove a card from play, return it to the box (it won’t be used for the remainder of the game). skills & skill tests there are 3 types of skills: fight, tech and negotiate, and skill points on crew and gear cards. each symbol counts as 1 skill point. fight skill is useful when resolving conflicts with violence. tech skill is used when facing challenges from ship breakdowns, breeching security systems, hacking computers to cracking vaults. negotiate skill helps you talk your way out of trouble or into more profit. skill tests are identified by a skill icon followed by a die and a target number and a list of possible results. to make a skill test, roll a die and add all your available skill points of the appropriate type. compare your total to the listed results. kosherized fight tests: you may not add any fight skill from gear to your total: only the fight skill listed on your crew cards may be used. bribes negotiate tests: before you roll a die, you may choose to pay bribes: for every $100 you pay the bank, add +1 to your total. thrillin’ heroics bonus roll: whenever you roll a firefly result, count it as a 6 and make a bonus roll. roll the die again and add the result to the total. game turn on your turn, you may take 2 actions in whichever order you’d like, and may also interact with other players in your sector. you may not take the same action twice. play then passes to the player to your left. on your turn, at no action cost, you may dump fuel, parts, cargo or contraband at any time, and you may drop fugitives and passengers off in any sector with a planet. action: fly you may choose to full burn or mosey: to full burn, spend 1 fuel token, move your firefly to an adjacent sector, then draw and resolve a nav card from the appropriate deck (alliance for blue-bordered sectors, border space for yellow-bordered sectors). you may continue to move into new sectors, drawing a new nav card for each, up to the maximum range of your ship’s drive core. to mosey, move your firefly 1 sector. do not spend a fuel token and do not draw from the nav decks. every nav card option results in either keep flying, full stop or evade: keep flying: you may move again and draw another nav card, up to your drive core’s maximum range. if your last movement ends with this result you may take any remaining actions this turn as normal. full stop: stop in the current sector; no further movement is possible. if you have another action to take, you may do so. evade: move to an adjacent sector, but do not draw an additional nav card; no further movement is possible. if you have another action to take, you may do so. a firefly is considered an outlaw ship if it has any outstanding warrants, is carrying contraband or fugitives, or has any wanted crew onboard. the alliance cruiser if you are ever in the same sector as the alliance cruiser, you must resolve the alliance contact event. this does not use an action, and you may take actions normally afterwards.if you do not have sufficient funds to pay fines, all available credits are seized (warrants are still cleared). drawing the alliance cruiser card while flying causes a full stop. the cruiser moves in 3 ways. when the alliance cruiser nav card is drawn, it moves to the sector of the player who drew the card. when alliance entanglements is drawn, the player who drew the card moves it. when cruiser patrol is drawn, the player to the right of the card drawer moves it 1 sector within alliance space. the reaver cutter if you start the same turn in the same sector as the reaver cutter, you must resolve the reaver contact event. this does not use an action, and you may take actions normally afterwards. when the reaver cutter nav card is drawn, the cutter moves to your current location and the card’s rules apply immediately. if the cutter moves into your sector as a result of reavers on the hunt, do not resolve the reaver contact event yet. no ship may move into a sector occupied by the reaver cutter. the cutter moves in 3 ways. when the reaver cutter nav card is drawn, it moves to the sector of the player who drew the card. when reaver bait is drawn, the player who drew the card moves it. when reavers on the hunt is drawn, the player to the right of the card drawer moves it 1 sector within border space. action: buy you may use this action to either purchase supply cards (crew, gear and ship upgrades) and restock fuel and parts, or to give your crew shore leave. signs on the map mark in which sectors you can buy from the corresponding supply deck and/or discard pile. buying supply cards when buying supply cards, look through the entire discard pile and choose up to 3 cards to consider. for each card less then 3 that you pull from the discard pile, you may draw 1 facedown card from the supply deck. you may then pay the bank for up to 2 of them (you don’t have to buy any), at the cost listed in the purple tab. place unpurchased cards faceup in the discard pile. buying fuel & parts at a supply planet, you may buy fuel for $100 each and parts for $300 each in addition to buying supply cards. shore leave when you are in a sector with a supply planet, you may use your buy action to give your crew shore leave, instead of buying supply cards. pay the bank $100 for each crew, disgruntled or not; then remove all disgruntled tokens. crew cards the cost to hire the crew is also the cut they expect to be paid at the end of each successful job. the maximum number of crew your ship can hold is listed on your ship card.crew with a warrant badge next to their cost are wanted by the alliance. if you have wanted crew you are an outlaw ship: when you encounter the alliance cruiser the crew may be seized. you may dismiss crew in any sector with a planet by placing them faceup in the discard pile of the card’s supply deck. this does not use an action. you may not dismiss crew to prevent them from being killed, and you may not dismiss your leader. leaders are crew but differ from normal crew: entrepreneur: leaders are self-employed and do not receive pay from jobs. really lucky! when the outcome of any event would cause your leader to be killed, return them to your ship and place a disgruntled token on the card instead. you’re all ruttin’ fired! if your leader receives a second disgruntled token, immediately discard all your crew to their supply deck discard piles and remove the disgruntled tokens from your leader. gear cards each member of your crew may only carry 1 piece of gear at a time. if you own more gear than can be carried, set the extra gear aside until it’s needed. gear not carried by a crew may not be used in any way. skill points from gear are added to your skill test totals. keywords represent specialized types of gear. ship upgrade cards all ship upgrade cards require an open upgrade slot on your ship card to purchase and equip. you may never have more upgrades than you have available slots. you may discard a ship upgrade to make room any time. drive core you may only have one drive core at a time. if you get a new core, discard your current one. each core has a maximum range: the number of sectors it can take the firefly during a full burn. drive cores may also have additional special rules. action: deal if you are in a sector with a contact, you may deal with that contact by looking at jobs in their contact deck. if you are solid with the contact, you may also sell cargo and contraband to them as part of your deal action. which sectors you can deal in are marked on the map. when in that sector, you may consider jobs from the corresponding contact deck. each card details what you need to do to complete the job and what you’ll earn. accepting job cards when buying job cards, look through the entire discard pile and choose up to 3 cards to consider. for each card less then 3 that you pull from the discard pile, you may draw 1 facedown card from the contact deck. you may then accept up to 2 of them (you don’t have to accept any). any unaccepted cards are placed faceup in the discard pile. inactive job cards you have not begun to work are kept concealed in your hand. do not place them faceup in the active job area until you use a work action to begin the job. you may not have more than 3 active and 3 inactive jobs at a time. job cards next to the job’s name is the symbol of the contact who gave you the job. there may be bonuses associated with doing certain job types: shipping jobs are legal and require you to pick up cargo at one location and drop it off at another planet. transport jobs require you to pick up passengers or fugitives and drop them off at another planet. transporting fugitives is illegal and makes you an outlaw ship. smuggling jobs are illegal and require you to pick up contraband at one location and drop it off at another planet. they require you to misbehave and make you an outlaw ship. crime jobs require you to head to a destination and misbehave; they usually only have a target location. immoral jobs are indicated by a small red tab below the legal/illegal tab. whenever you complete an immoral job, all your moral crew become disgruntled. illegal jobs require you to misbehave to complete them. the number of misbehave cards pictured on the job indicates how many misbehave cards you’ll draw when working the job. job instructions and requirements after misbehaving (if necessary), every job has different instructions. crime jobs have 1 set of instructions; deliveries have 2 sets. some jobs require skills and/or keywords to work the job, listed in the skill needs window. some jobs have a green bonus tab listing a profession and a credit amount. if a member of the crew who completes the job has that profession, the credits listed in the bonus tab are added to the pay. job payment the purple tab shows how much you’ll be paid for completing the job. if the tab says special, the pay is detailed in the job instructions. when you finish a job, your need to pay your crew. action: work you may attempt to advance one job: loading cargo, committing crimes or other activities. to start work on a job, you must be in the pick-up location for deliveries or target location for crime. once you’ve met the job’s needs, place the job card faceup to the left of your ship card: it becomes an active job. the only way to clear an active job is to complete it or have a warrant issued while working it. to work a job using a work action: equip crew you must commit to what gear you’re carrying while working the job. each crew and leader may only carry 1 gear card; gear not carried is on the ship. gear cannot change hands between crew until the job attempt is over. if a member of your crew with gear is killed, the gear they were carrying is returned to the ship. gear or crew on the ship may not be used in any way while working the job. crew may be forced to return to the ship. crew on the ship may not be affected by the results of any misbehave cards or skill tests encountered when working a job. confirm needs the team you have assembled must meet any requirements in the needs tab on the job card to work the job. if not, the job may not be advanced in any way. job cards without a needs tab have no prerequisites. some jobs have a test to take instead of needs. do the job, legally follow the instructions on the job card to attempt to work the job. delivery jobs require you to pick up something at one location and deliver it to another. you must use a work action at both the pick-up and drop-off location to complete the job. if you’ve loaded cargo, contraband, passengers or fugitives on to your ship as part of a job and subsequently lose them, you can’t return to the pick-up location to get more. misbehave to complete an illegal job, you must successfully proceed through the number of misbehave cards pictured. draw cards 1 at a time, only drawing another card once you’ve proceeded past the previous card. once you start misbehaving, you must see the attempt through. misbehave cards are always placed in the discard pile after being resolved. most misbehave cards have 2 options; you may attempt either option. some options may start with a requirement. you may not choose an option with a need you cannot meet. if there is a person, profession or specific named item in the bottom right hand corner of the misbehave cards, you may proceed automatically if you have this ‘ace’. misbehave cards end in 1 of 3 ways: proceed: you may continue to work the job, following its instructions. attempt botched: you’ve failed this attempt but you may attempt the job again in a future turn. leave the job card faceup in your active jobs area. warrant issued: the attempt has failed and the authorities are aware of your involvement. place a warrant token on your ship card. discard the job card to the discard pile of the issuing contact. success: get paid when you successfully complete a job take credits from the bank equal to the pay listed on the job card. your reputation becomes solid with the contact that issued the job. when you complete a job for a contact you’re already solid with, remove the job card from the game. when a job with a bonus tab is completed successfully and you have a crew with the listed profession, take the bonus listed. a bonus is only paid once, regardless of how many crew you have with the listed profession. pay each crew (not the leader) the value listed on their card (whether they worked the job or not), returning this money to the bank. you have to pay them the same amount regardless of the job’s pay. you may choose not to pay some, or all, of your crew their cut. any crew not paid immediately become disgruntled: place a disgruntled token on their card. you do not have to pay your crew after receiving credits from other sources. disgruntled crew when a crew becomes disgruntled place a disgruntled token on their card. a disgruntled crew that receives a second disgruntled token for any reason is immediately discarded to their original supply deck. they are immediately available to be rehired by you or any other player in that area. other players may hire disgruntled crew away from you when in the same sector by paying their hiring fee to the bank. the disgruntled crew joins their new captain’s crew and the disgruntled token is removed. reputation to show you are solid with a contact, take the completed job card and slide it under your ship card so the name of the contact is visible. when you are solid, contacts will buy cargo and contraband from you at the prices on the contact side of the job cards. most contacts’ special rules (listed at the top of the contact side of the job card) take effect when you are solid with them. however niska’s pound of flesh special rule is in effect as soon as you accept one of his jobs. if you receive a warrant while working a job for a contact, any reputation with that contact is lost along with any and all benefits for being solid. you may subsequently again prove yourself solid to an offended contact by completing a job for him. receiving a warrant for any reason will cause reputation loss with harken, regardless of what contact the job you were working came from. you may not become solid with harken while you have a warrant. make-work if you have nothing to do and your firefly is in a sector with a planet, you may use a work action to take $200 from the bank.winning the game each story card details the steps you need to win the game. if the story card has numbered goals you must complete them in order. you must use a work action to advance a goal: take a goal token to mark your progress. if the goal requires misbehaving, misbehave before following any other instructions. special abilities that apply during jobs do not apply while working goals, and you do not pay your crew after completing a goal. some story cards’ skill tests have attempt botched as a result. like misbehave cards, when you botch an attempt you may try the test again the following turn. if you receive a warrant while working a goal, put a warrant token on your ship card. you may attempt to work the goal again your next turn. additional rules parley with rivals there are 2 interactions that can occur between players in the same sector: 1. trading when 2 or more players’ ships are stopped in the same sector, players may buy, sell and trade crew, fuel, parts, cargo, contraband, ship upgrades and gear without restriction. players are free to discuss and make these deals outside of the normal turn order and other players may take their normal turn while bargains are struck. dealing with other players in this fashion does not require using an action. the opportunity for trading ends when one of the players leaves the sector. 2. hiring disgruntled crew while stopped in the same sector as a rival, a player may pay the hiring cost of a disgruntled crew to the bank. that crew jumps ship; add the card to your crew area and remove the disgruntled token. pass the dinosaur the player whose turn it is holds the dinosaur marker, then passes it to the next player after taking their second action. if, as your second action, you’re buying from a supply deck or dealing with a contact, you may pass the dinosaur to the next player before you’re done considering your cards to speed up the turns. death in the ’verse whenever a test result reads kill some number of crew, choose an appropriate number of your crew to remove from the game. whenever crew are killed the controlling player always may choose which crew are discarded. if you have a medic in your crew, make a medic check when a crew is killed: 1-4: crew dies, remove from play 5-6: crew is returned to the ship. medics may make a medic check even if they are the ones at risk of dying. only make 1 medic check per crew killed, regardless of how many medics are in your crew. all medics have this ability, even if this rule is not printed on their card (as with simon tam and doralee)."
93,149776,FIRETEAM ZERO,2016,EMERGENT GAMES,2.7593,54,"setup players choose a mission and refer to its mission briefing in the mission briefing book. place the specified sector tiles into the proper configuration. players choose or randomly determine a player to take the start player token. starting with that player and going clockwise, each player selects a hero and takes that hero’s reference card. if the mission briefing specifies that a particular role is required for the mission, someone must select that hero. in the core set, only one leader (abe or maxine) can be used in a mission. if playing solo, choose 2 heroes and play them both as if it were a 2 player game. take the upgrade, action, and focus cards matching your hero’s role. select any upgrade cards you are entitled to as specified by the mission briefing and shuffle them together with your action cards to form your action deck. upgrade cards are marked with a star in the center and come in sets of 4 identical cards. when you select an upgrade, shuffle all 4 cards of that type into your deck. select any focus cards you are entitled to and place them faceup in front of you. any remaining upgrade and focus cards are returned to the box. place the 12 spawn tokens face up in the indicated locations in any order you choose. place the exit point token in the indicated location (if one is specified). if the mission features a boss monster, place a power token where indicated. place the threat track near the board, with the threat token on the first space. shuffle the twist cards specified by the briefing and place them facedown near the track. take the monster reference cards and objective cards specified by the briefing and place them faceup near the board. shuffle the event cards and draw the number specified by the briefing, returning the rest to the box. then, gather the discovery cards specified by the briefing and shuffle them together with the event cards to form the recon deck, which consists of 12 cards. place the lucky coin heads up near the board. take the monster figures which make up the spawn pool as specified by the briefing. roll the spawn die for each, placing that monster in the location which contains the corresponding spawn token. some missions may specify additional monsters to be set aside in a reserve pool. place both specialist figures and each player’s hero figure in the entry point location specified by the briefing. sequence of play 1. tactics phase perform the following steps in order. on the first round of the game, skip the first 2 steps. 1. determine start player the player that currently holds the start player token passes it to the player to his left. 2. play a tactical response one player (only) may play a tactical response from his hand. the player who currently holds the start player token has the final say if there are any disputes. a hero that is knocked down may not play a tactical response, or be affected by such a card played by another player.3. draw cards each player who did not play a tactical response may draw action cards from his action deck to replenish his hand size (normally 5 cards). anyone who played a tactical response does not draw any cards. a hero that is knocked down may draw cards normally. if your action deck becomes depleted, immediately reshuffle your discard pile to form a new deck. you may have a number of cards equal or over your hand size if you were instructed to draw cards by a game effect (in which case you would no draw cards in this phase). 2. hero phase starting with the player who holds the start player token and going clockwise, each player takes a turn. on your turn, you may normally move your hero and perform 1 action. both are optional, and you may perform your action either before, after, or in the middle of movement. if your hero has been knocked down, you must choose at the start of your turn to leave him down and skip your turn, or stand him up and take your turn normally. specialists cannot perform actions, cannot be targeted by an attack, and can only move by accompanying a moving hero. moving a hero moves from one location to an adjacent location up to a distance equal to his speed (normally 2). locations are adjacent even if they only touch diagonally. difficult terrain cost 2 moves to enter, and both moves must be spent at the same time. monsters are unaffected by difficult terrain. impassable terrain (yellow diagonal stripes) may not be entered, even by monsters. guarding specialists when you move your hero out of a location containing 1 or more specialist figures, you may choose to bring any or all of them with you if you wish. if yours is the only hero in that location, you must bring any specialists with you; this applies even if your movement is involuntary. fleeing you may not normally move your hero out of a location which contains more monsters than active heroes. however any special one-off moves such as those granted by an event, a reaction, or a tactical response are not restricted by the presence of monsters. specialists are not considered heroes and do not count toward comparing the ratio of monsters to heroes. actions you may normally perform only 1 action per turn. the two standard actions are attacking and searching, but mission objectives and some focus cards may provide additional possibilities.attacking you may attack a monster by playing 1 or more cards and combining them as a single attack action. all cards played must share the same attack type. the target must be also within each card’s attack range. add together the attack strength of each card played to determine the total attack strength of the attack and roll that number of attack dice. you may never roll more than 8 dice. each hit symbol rolled which matches the attack type of the attack inflicts 1 damage on the monster. some cards provide bonus hits, which are added to any hits rolled on your attack dice. there is no limit to the total number of bonus hits which may be added to an attack. any damage inflicted upon a monster is reduced by its resistance to that attack type. some effects allow an attack to ignore a monster’s resistance entirely. after subtracting any resistance, you must inflict damage equal to or greater than the monster’s health (the large number on its reference card) to kill it. all damage required to kill a monster must be inflicted in a single attack; any damage insufficient to kill it is lost and has no effect after that attack is resolved. if a monster is killed, remove it from the board and return it to the spawn pool or reserve pool as appropriate. boss fights inflicting damage upon a boss monster equal to or greater than its health merely injures it. when a boss monster enters play, place the indicated number of power tokens on its reference card (usually 1 for each hero). whenever an attack inflicts sufficient damage to injure a boss monster, remove 1 power token from its card. when the last token is removed, the boss monster has been defeated. remove it from the board, but do not return it to the spawn pool. terrain effects any ranged attack targeting a location with cover terrain has its attack strength reduced by 1 die, to a minimum of 0. attacks originating in the same location are not affected. monsters and heroes both benefit from cover terrain. any ranged attack originating in a location with elevated terrain has its attack strength increased by 1 die if targeting a non-elevated location. attacks targeting the same location (or any other elevated location) are not affected. monsters and heroes both benefit from elevated terrain. explosives any hits inflicted with a bomb attack type are applied to every figure in the target’s location: active heroes, monsters and attacker. specialists never take damage. special attacks if a mission or card effect requires you to attack things other than monsters, you may perform a normal attack action against your target as if it were a monster. any damage you inflict on another hero is resolved as if it had been inflicted by an attacking monster. when attacking something else, the effect will be explained by instructions. specialist: henry if the specialist henry is in your location or any adjacent location when you perform an attack action, you may reroll 1 of your attack dice after rolling for your attack.searching if your hero occupies a location containing a faceup spawn token and no monsters, you may use your action to search that location. turn the token facedown to indicate that it has been searched and draw a card from the recon deck, resolving the card’s effects immediately. mission objectives may require that the heroes search for discovery cards found in the recon deck. when found, these cards usually instruct you to place intel tokens on the related objective card (either immediately, or after performing some specified task) to indicate progress toward completing that objective. once the indicated number of tokens has been placed on an objective card, that objective is complete. ambush! if a recon card indicates that you are ambushed by a monster, spawn that monster in your location and activate it immediately. take that monster from the spawn pool if possible. if this is not possible because all eligible monsters are already on the board, take one of those instead, selecting the one furthest away from your location. reactions may not be played in response to an ambush. specialist: patty if the specialist patty is in your location or any adjacent location, you may search as a free action. these searches are resolved in the normal manner but do not count as your action for the turn, leaving you free to perform another action as well. 2. threat phase perform the following steps in order: 1. advance the threat token advance the threat token 1 space along the threat track. if it reaches a space that indicates a new twist card should be drawn, draw and a card from the twist deck and place it faceup on the track in the spot provided. each twist card added to the track introduces a new rule which goes into effect immediately. if the threat token reaches the last space on the track, it moves no further and no further twist cards are drawn. 2. activate monsters activate each monster in turn, beginning with any minions before activating any elite monsters, and saving the boss (if there is one) for last. within each type, you may activate the individual monsters in any order you choose. when a monster is activated, it moves and attacks in the following sequence: 1. monster movement if there is already an active hero in the monster’s current location, the monster does not move. otherwise, it moves a distance up to its speed toward the closest active hero, moving from one adjacent location to another in the same manner as a hero. if it must choose between equidistant heroes, it moves toward the one earliest in turn order. 2. the activation die roll the activation die: blank: no effect. move symbol: the monster immediately moves 1 additional location using the normal rules for monster movement. special symbol: check the monster’s reference card and resolve its special ability.3. monster attacks after moving, a monster always attacks an active hero within range of its attack if it is capable of doing so. if it must choose between targets at different ranges, it always chooses the closest. if it must choose between targets at the same range, it always chooses the one earliest in turn order. roll a number of attack dice equal to the monster’s attack strength. each hit symbol rolled which matches the monster’s attack type inflicts 1 hit on the target hero. the hero must discard 1 action card of his choice for each hit. if he does not have enough cards in hand to discard the required number, he is knocked down. taking one for the team when a hero is targeted for an attack, any other active hero in the same location may voluntarily intercede, becoming the new target for the attack. this decision must be made before rolling for damage. explosives any hits inflicted with a bomb attack type are applied to every active hero in the target’s location. monster attacks do not damage other monsters in the same location as their target. knockdown if a hero must discard a greater number of cards than he currently has in hand, he discards his entire hand and is knocked down. tip his figure onto its side until his next turn. each time a hero is knocked down, the lucky coin is flipped tails up. if the coin is already tails up, the players immediately fail the mission and lose the game. if your hero is knocked down, he is not considered an active hero. you may not play cards for any reason (including as a reaction), nor may your hero be damaged by any effect. monsters ignore a knocked down hero for the purposes of movement and attack. unprotected specialists if the last active hero in a specialist’s location is knocked down, the threat token is advanced 1 additional space along the track. if this causes a new twist card to be drawn, draw it immediately. if your hero is the sole guard for both specialists, the threat token is advanced twice if you are knocked down. 3. spawn monsters skip this step if a boss monster is in play. roll the spawn die for each available monster in the spawn pool, beginning with any minions before proceeding to any elite monsters. add each monster figure to the location which contains the spawn token corresponding to the number rolled unless it is secured. securing spawn points any location containing at least 1 active hero and no monsters is secured against monster spawning (place your hero figure on top of the spawn token as a reminder). if a secured location is rolled during monster spawning, roll again until an unsecured location is rolled. boss fights if the mission features a boss monster, monsters stop spawning when the boss monster enters play. for as long as the boss monster remains on the board, the spawn monsters step of the threat phase is skipped. if the boss monster is defeated, monsters resume spawning as normal if any objectives remain yet to be completed.winning the game the heroes complete their mission and immediately win the game when they have achieved all the objectives specified and all heroes have reached the designated exit point. if the mission does not designate an exit point, the heroes immediately win when they complete all of their objectives. the heroes fail the mission and lose immediately if a hero is ever knocked down while the lucky coin is tails up. cards & tokens action cards each of a hero’s action cards features an attack section at the top of the card which is used when playing those cards as an attack action during the hero phase. each card also has one of two other ways it can be played: as a tactical response or as a reaction. a player whose hero has been knocked down may not play cards for any reason, including as a tactical response or a reaction. reactions can be played at any time, when the triggering event specified by the card occurs. each player may only play 1 reaction in response to a single triggering event. the target of the reaction (as specified on the card) must be within the indicated range. reactions may not be played in response to an ambush. objective cards each mission features a number of objective cards. each card describes what must be accomplished in order to complete that objective: often that a certain number of intel tokens must be placed on them. the card itself may specify what must be done to place an intel token on it; or the heroes may have to search to find the required discovery cards which will supply those tokens. some objective cards indicate that the heroes may flip the lucky coin back to heads up once the objective has been completed. if it is already heads up when such an objective is completed, it remains heads up. intel tokens intel tokens fulfil a number of functions: they are placed on objective cards to track progress toward completing an objective; on discovery cards to track progress toward resolving an encounter; and on the board to represent things with which the heroes might interact. use the letters on the backs of the tokens to differentiate them if you are tracking multiple things at the same time. you can place a matching token on the corresponding card if you need to keep track of which tokens go with which card. spawn & reserve pools each mission specifies a mix of monster figures which make up the spawn pool. any monsters placed on the board during setup are taken from this pool unless otherwise specified. killed monsters are returned to the spawn pool, where they become available to return to the board during the threat phase. some missions may specify additional monsters to be placed in a reserve pool. these may be spawned under mission-specific circumstances but are not considered part of the mission’s spawn pool. monsters in the reserve pool are spawned only when specifically indicated, and are returned to the reserve pool when they leave play. if you are instructed to add a monster from the reserve pool to the spawn pool, it becomes part of the spawn pool for the remainder of the mission, spawning normally during the threat phase and being returned to the spawn pool if killed."
95,37046,GHOST STORIES,2008,ASMODEE,2.9023,1034,"setup the game can be played at 4 levels of difficulty: initiation, normal, nightmare, and hell. these rules are for initiation level; other numbers of players require adjustments as noted. randomly arrange the 9 village tiles to form a 3 by 3 square. the front of each tile is the location with its owner (active); the back, without its owner (haunted). at the beginning of the game place all locations faceup. place the 4 game boards along the sides of the square of tiles so each is facing a player. each of the boards has 3 rectangular spaces for ghosts, 6 circular stones (2 steps in front of each of the 3 ghost spaces) for the haunting figures, 3 circular spaces for the buddha figures, and stones in the lower-left corner depicting the taoist’s power. the boards are double-sided, each side with a different power. randomly assign each player a color, and which side of their board to use. each player takes 4 qi tokens, a yin-yang token and a tao token in their color, and a black tao token; and places the taoist figure of their color on the central village tile. place the 2 buddha figures on the buddhist temple tile.shuffle the ghost cards and insert a random, unseen, wu-feng incarnation card 10 cards before the bottom of the deck. ghosts are characterized by color, resistance, abilities, and sometimes a reward. ghost abilities are grouped according to when they are activated: those in the left stone are applied when the ghost enters the game; those in the center stone are applied each turn in the yin phase; and those in the right stone are applied when the ghost is exorcised. if a ghost has several abilities, they are applied from left to right. the last player to have seen a kung-fu movie starts. game turn the players take turns in clockwise order. each player’s turn comprises 2 phases (yin and yang). yin phase (ghosts) 1. ghosts’ actions announce the ghosts on your board. abilities in a ghost card’s center stone are active in the yin phase. a. presence of ghost(s) with the haunter ability for each of these ghosts on your board, update the position of the associated haunting figure. if the figure is on the card, advance it off the card, to the stone depicting a haunter. if the figure is already on the first stone of the board, it advances to the haunting stone at the edge of the board, and you must flip the first village tile in front of the ghost facedown (it becomes haunted). if the tile in front of the ghost is already haunted, then the next one on the same line gets flipped facedown. the haunting figure is then returned to the card, ready for the next such cycle.b. presence of ghost(s) with the tormentor ability for each tormentor (a ghost with a curse die on the center stone) on your board, roll the curse die: no effect. the first active village tile in front of the ghost becomes haunted. bring a ghost into play according to the placement rules. discard all your tao tokens. lose 1 qi token. 2. board overrun? if all 3 ghost spaces on your board are occupied, lose 1 qi token and immediately end your yin phase without performing step 3. 3. arrival of a ghost if your board is not overrun by 3 ghosts, draw the first ghost card from the deck, and bring it into play: ghost placement rules: red (mountain), green (forest), blue (river), or yellow (marsh) ghosts must be placed on the corresponding color board, if possible. black ghosts must be placed on the active player’s board, if possible. if all 3 spaces are already occupied, then the active player chooses any other location. the abilities indicated in the ghost’s left stone are applied as soon as the location is chosen. if all 12 spaces are occupied by ghosts at this time, instead of adding the ghost you lose 1 qi token. yang phase (taoist) as the taoist, you follow this sequence. additionally, you may use your yin-yang power before or after any step. 1. move (optional) you may move your taoist figure to an adjacent space. diagonal movement is allowed. 2. request help from a villager or attempt an exorcism you may perform only one of the 2 following actions: a. request support from a villager you may request help from the villager on your current tile. the actions are detailed on the reference sheet. b. attempt an exorcism you may exorcise the ghost from a space adjacent to the tile on which the you are standing. once a ghost is exorcised, it is discarded and its abilities vanish. if you fail, nothing happens. to attempt to exorcise a ghost, roll the 3 tao dice, and roll a number of colored faces equal to the ghost’s resistance. the white faces are wild, and can represent whatever color you choose.if you fail, you may spend tao tokens of the color you need in order to cover the difference. a taoist standing on one of the 4 corner tiles may exorcise both adjacent spaces, or 2 ghosts with one roll. you must roll both ghosts’ resistance in one roll to succeed and may, as usual, use tao tokens to cover the difference. you are never required to spend tao, but if the dice are sufficient to exorcise a ghost, you must exorcise it. during an exorcism, a taoist may use tao tokens of one or more taoists standing on the same village tile. players can neither give nor exchange tao tokens otherwise. certain ghosts curse and/or reward the taoist that exorcises them, as indicated on the right-hand stone on their card. the most frequent curse is to roll the curse die; the potential rewards are gaining tao tokens (the player chooses the color from those available in the supply), gaining a qi point, or recovering your yin-yang. curses are always applied before rewards. 3) place a buddha (optional) if you obtained a buddha figurine during a previous turn, you may place it if your taoist faces an empty ghost space. place the figure on the buddha symbol. you may place 2 buddhas in the same turn if you stand on a corner tile and the corresponding spaces are free. once a ghost is placed or moved onto a space protected by a buddha, the ghost is immediately discarded; and it may not apply its curses or grant its rewards. the buddha is then placed back on the buddhist temple tile. yin-yang each taoist has a yin-yang power, which permits you to receive aid from any villager without having to be on that villager’s tile, or to flip a haunted tile back to its active side (bringing the villager back). when you use your yin-yang, return the token to the supply. exorcising certain ghosts may give back a player’s yin-yang to use again (even in the same turn). death of a taoist a taoist with no more qi is dead. all their possessions are lost (tao tokens, buddha figures, yin-yang, power tokens), and their figure is placed lying on the cemetery tile. ghosts on their board remain in play. the player continues to play and deliberate with the other taoists, and they can still win the game. they may even come back to life, with the aid of the cemetery tile. their board becomes possessed and the ghosts occupying it continue to act (steps 1 and 2 of the yin phase). the incarnations of wu-feng an incarnation of wu-feng comes into play 10 cards before the end of the deck. each incarnation has an ability, and conditions which must be met in order to vanquish it. every incarnation has a color and is subject to the same placement rules as ghosts.the incarnations are not affected by the sorcerer’s hut tile or buddhas. an incarnation that comes into play on a space occupied by a buddha is not eliminated, but the buddha is still returned to the buddhist temple tile. some incarnations cast a curse when they are exorcised. winning and losing the game the game ends if the players manage to exorcise the last incarnation of wu-feng. 3 situations result in the players’ defeat: 1. all the taoists are dead (no more qi tokens). 2. a 3rd location in the village is haunted. 3. the deck of ghosts is exhausted while an incarnation of wu-feng is still in play. even if the last incarnation is sent to hell, the players still have to suffer any curse it carries. they only win if applying the curse does not bring about their defeat. players may score their games (see the rulebook). 1, 2 or 3 players setup set up boards without players randomly; these will be neutral boards. place 3 qi tokens on each of these. in addition to yin-yang and tao tokens, give each player (not neutral boards) a power token. remove 5 random cards from the deck (and the game) for each missing player, without looking at them. then add the incarnation(s) of wu-feng as normal. in a 2 player game, the players must sit facing each other. in a solitaire game, the red board must have the dance of the spires power visible. take 1 tao token of each color (plus black in initiation mode), and 3 power tokens. no aid can be requested from the cemetery tile, and the pavilion of the heavenly wind action allows the player to move their own taoist. neutral boards a neutral board’s turn is reduced to a shorter yin phase (no step 3), and there is no yang phase. 1. ghosts’ actions a. presence of ghost(s) with the haunter ability for each of these ghosts on the board, update the position of the associated haunting figure according to the normal rules. b. presence of ghost(s) with the tormentor ability for each tormentor, a player must roll the curse die and apply its effect for the neutral board (the green taoist’s power is ineffective for this die roll). the loss of tao tokens has no effect on a neutral board. 2. board overrun? if all 3 ghost spaces on the board are occupied, the board loses 1 qi. a neutral board cannot receive qi. if the board was already at 0 qi, a player must take the qi loss. possessed board when a taoist dies, or a neutral board loses its last qi, the board becomes possessed and neutral. the power of the possessed board becomes inactive (place an inactive power token on its power stone). any loss of qi points must be taken by a player of your choice (the green taoist’s power is ineffective if this is due to a die roll). power token a power token allows the active player to use a neutral, unpossessed board’s active power during their yang phase. multiple tokens may be used during the same turn, but not for the same power. place any used power tokens, or those that belonged to a dead taoist, on the central tile of the village. an active player who ends their turn there can reclaim 1 or more power tokens. like tao tokens, power tokens cannot be exchanged between the players. taoist powers yellow taoist 1. bottomless pockets before your move, take a tao token of whatever color you choose from among those available. 2. enfeeblement mantra before your move, place the enfeeblement mantra token onto any ghost in the game. the ghost’s exorcism resistance is reduced by 1, whoever performs the exorcism. note that when fighting multicolored incarnations, the color of the mantra may be chosen after the dice roll. when the targeted ghost is removed from the game, take back the token; you may use it again on your next turn. if you lose your power, remove the enfeeblement mantra token from the game. red taoist 1. dance of the spires during your move, you can fly to any village tile. 2. dance of the twin winds before your move, you can move 1 other taoist 1 space. green taoist 1. the gods’ favoriteyou can reroll each tao die involved in a support action or an exorcism (you may keep some of the tao dice and reroll the rest). you may also reroll the curse die. you must always keep the second result. 2. strength of a mountain you have a fourth (gray) tao die when performing exorcisms, and you never roll the curse die. blue taoist 1. heavenly gust you can request aid from villagers and attempt an exorcism, in whatever order you choose. 2. second wind from your current village tile, you can request aid from villagers twice or attempt 2 exorcisms. the 2 exorcisms are independent: you can’t keep a partial success from the first and apply it to the second.powers of the incarnations howling nightmare the taoists can only exorcise this incarnation if the haunting stone facing them on the opposite board is not occupied by a ghost. uncatchable this incarnation must be on a location occupied by a buddha figure in order for you to exorcise it. this can be done by moving the incarnation onto a buddha, or bringing it into play on a buddha. this incarnation is the only one affected by buddhas. death army this incarnation requires the active player to roll the curse die each turn, and when the incarnation is destroyed. forgotten ones when this incarnation comes into play, all taoists are prevented from using their powers, including power tokens. bonecracker all players must discard a tao token when this comes into play, as well as at the beginning of each yin phase of the player who harbors this incarnation on their board (even a neutral board). if a player has no tao, nothing happens. dark mistress when this incarnation comes into play (and until its destruction), the taoists are prevented from using tao tokens (put the inactive tao marker on the table). creeping horror this incarnation captures a tao die upon its arrival and keeps it until its destruction (keep the die on the card). vampire lord the vampire lord is a haunter with a resistance of 4. hope killer this incarnation has a resistance of 8 (2 blue + 2 red + 2 green + 2 yellow) and requires a roll of the curse die when it is destroyed. nameless this incarnation has a resistance of 1 blue + 1 green + 1 yellow + 1 red + 1 black. upon its arrival in the game, this incarnation discards the tao token on the circle of prayer village tile. additionally, the white faces on the tao dice no longer count as wild. level of difficulty normal mode means the taoists start the game with 3 qi tokens, not 4. taoists begin the game with their colored tao token but without the black tao token. nightmare uses the rules of normal mode, but there are 4 incarnations to defeat. with only 1 or 2 players, there are only 3 incarnations. remove the appropriate number of ghosts if there are fewer than 4 players, and then (without looking) randomly insert the incarnations into the deck as follows: 10 cards, 1 incarnation (repeat 3 more times), then the rest of the cards. hell is the same as nightmare, but the taoists start the game without their yin-yang."
97,227460,HANNIBAL AND HAMILCAR,2019,PHALANX GAMES,3.9205,88,"setup choose a scenario. select the specified strategy cards and shuffle them into a facedown deck. shuffle all the battle cards into a facedown deck. in the hamilcar scenario, do the same for the tactics cards. remove the general’s cards with the icon when playing the hannibal scenarios, or those with the icon when playing the hamilcar scenarios. then set up the roman general’s cards on the roman side of the board, faceup, and the carthaginian general’s cards on the carthaginian side of the board, faceup. place the turn/truce marker (appropriate side faceup) on the indicated space of the turn track. place the political control markers (pcs), tribe markers, and walled city markers on the map as instructed by the scenario. place pcs on the provincial display as instructed. place the combat units (cus) and general miniatures (or markers) on the board as instructed. place subordinate generals on their commanding general’s cards. sequence of play 1. reinforcements skip this phase on the first turn. 1. carthaginian player places reinforcements as instructed. then, if there are any displaced carthaginian generals, place them on any space containing 1 or more carthaginian cus that are not currently under siege. carthaginian reinforcements are placed in specific areas; if the roman player controls the area, those reinforcements are not placed. 2. roman player places reinforcements as instructed. reinforcements may not be placed inside a besieged walled city. if an enemy force occupies an unbesieged friendly walled city space, reinforcements may still be placed inside the walled city if the total cus in the city do not exceed the maximum number allowed within it. an enemy general without cus does not restrict the placement of reinforcements and becomes displaced if reinforcements are placed in that space. if roma is besieged and all roman generals are inside it, the roman player does not receive any reinforcements. 3. roman player elects consuls and proconsuls designate one of the roman generals on the map as a proconsul (this is optional but recommended), who then remains on the map with their army. place the proconsul marker on his card. you are only allowed 1 proconsul in play at a time. remove the other roman generals from the map and return their general’s cards to the consular pool (your roman general’s cards). out of this pool, randomly draw 2 roman general’s cards to be consuls for the turn and place their miniatures on the map. consuls are placed together or separately in a space containing at least 5 roman cus (if there is only one such space, both consuls must be placed together). a consul may be placed with a proconsul, in which case the proconsul becomes a subordinate. consuls may be placed inside a besieged roma (roman cus may not) if there is no other legal space to place them. 2. strategy each player draws the number of strategy cards listed on the turn track or in the scenario rules.each scenario details who is the first (deciding) player, who must ask their opponent if they are going to preempt. their opponent may preempt by immediately playing a major or minor campaign card and going first. if there is no preempt, the deciding player chooses who goes first. players alternate playing strategy cards until all cards in their hands have been played. if one player uses all their cards and the other still has some left, the latter plays them one at a time until they are all played. when you play a card you may either use its operation points (ops) or resolve its event. a remove if played event must be removed from the game after being played as an event (but not if it is played for its ops). you may discard a strategy card faceup rather than play it: no action occurs and it is now your opponent’s turn. discard piles may be examined by any player at any time. if there are not enough cards in the deck to deal a full hand to each player, reshuffle the entire deck and the discard pile (excluding cards that have been permanently removed from play) before any cards are dealt. the deck is also reshuffled when the truce card is played or discarded (whether the event is used or not); in this case, reshuffle the deck at the end of the turn. when using ops, do one of the following: move a general (with or without cus) whose strategy rating is less than or equal to the ops; place pcs equal to the ops, each on a space that does not contain one of your pcs, a tribe, walled city, or an enemy cu. you may also convert enemy pcs (by flipping them over) if you have a cu in the pc’s space; raise troops (3 op card only) by placing 1 cu with any general in a friendly controlled space in a friendly controlled province (not a besieged walled city). events can only be played by the side indicated by the color behind the op number (red for roman or blue for carthaginian). counter events (crossed swords icon and purple frame) can only be played in the middle of a card play or battle, and do not count as your normal card play. 3. winter attrition all cus (with or without generals) in spaces containing an enemy pc or a non-friendly tribe suffer attrition. 4. political isolation removal each player (starting with the romans in the hannibal scenarios or the carthaginians in the hamilcar scenario) must remove all their non-walled, non-tribe pcs that are isolated. a pc is isolated if it cannot trace a path to: a friendly cu, a friendly controlled tribe, a friendly controlled port, or a friendly controlled walled city (besieged or not). the path cannot cross a mountain pass, enter a space containing an enemy pc or a neutral tribe (unless a friendly cu is also present), or a space with enemy cus (unless a friendly pc is also present). the path may pass through vacant spaces. 5. victory check players count the number of politically significant provinces they control (all provinces except gallia transalpina, massilia, liguria, baleares, and the optional mauretania). you earn 1 political point (pp) for each politically significant province you control. compare totals. if one side has fewer points than the other, the player in the minority must remove a number of their own non- walled, non-tribe pcs from the map equal to the difference. if a player does not have enough pcs to remove, they immediately lose the game.on the last turn, the player with the most pps wins. if there is a tie in the hannibal scenario, the carthaginian player wins. if there is a tie in the hamilcar scenario, the roman player wins. the roman player wins a sudden death victory if they control carthago. the carthaginian player wins a sudden death victory if they control roma, or if they control all provinces in italia except latium during a victory check phase. movement generals may move with or without cus, but cus cannot move without a general. a general and the cus with him are an army. only 1 army moves with each strategy card (unless a campaign card is played). a general without an army may not move into a space containing an enemy cu or stop in a space containing an enemy general without an army (though he may pass through such a space). pcs do not stop or slow movement of units. a general and up to 10 cus may move up to 4 adjacent (connected by a line) spaces (6 with a forced march card or the nero special ability). to move, select the general you wish to activate. if there are 2 or more generals with an army, you may designate which is the commanding general. then select up to 10 cus and any number of subordinates to accompany the commanding general. play a strategy card that can move the commander. move the army. as the army enters each space, it may trigger a reaction phase. if the non-active player is successful with an interception, the active army may back up 1 space and end its move. then, if your army has at least 5 cus and it enters a space containing 1 enemy cu without a general, the active army may overrun. the enemy cu is automatically eliminated. this is not a a land battle, your army can continue its movement, and you can overrun any number of times in a single turn. when the move is complete, the army may conduct a siege or subjugation attempt or a land battle (you can never do both on the play of a single strategy card). stacking and subordinates there is no limit to the number of cus that can be stacked in a space. there can be more than 1 general in a space, but only 1 can be the commanding general; all others there are subordinates. keep the commanding general on the map, and place the subordinates on the commanding general’s card. when a commanding general moves, the subordinates freely move with him. while a general is a subordinate, his special abilities may not be used. hannibal and hamilcar barca outrank all other carthaginian generals. consuls outrank proconsuls. if 2 or more generals of the same rank are in an army, the controlling player may change who is commander before activating the army. however, if 1 general outranks another, the ranking general must be commander. if 2 consuls are in the same space, a change of command die roll may be required to see who is in command. reaction phase if an army enters a space with a walled city, the non-active player declares their cus to be outside or inside the city and moves them above (outside) or below (inside) the city marker. the non-active player declares all their land interception and avoid land battle attempts before any are carried out, and is required to attempt all those declared. avoid battle: the non-active player rolls and, if successful, moves the army out of the space. land interception: the non-active player conducts interceptions in any order. an army intercepting into a space may not enter a walled city.when you move an army into a space containing 1 or more enemy cus, and those enemy cus do not, cannot, or fail to avoid battle, your army must stop, end its movement, and battle the enemy force. mountain passes and straits movement across mountain passes and straits costs 2 movement points (mps). roll for attrition immediately after crossing a pass (-2 to the roll if it was a non-alps pass). land movement across the strait of messana is allowed only if the moving player controls the city from which the movement is originating. walled cities a walled city is a space within a space; generals and cus can be inside or outside the marker. rome and carthage can hold 5 cus and other cities 2 cus. generals and cus may be split; generals inside are placed to the side of the marker. only cus outside a city stop enemy movement. generals and cus can be moved inside and outside cities through normal movement during your turn. each time an enemy army enters a non-besieged walled city space the non-active player with armies there may declare them as inside or outside. combining and dividing armies you can pick up and drop off cus and generals of equal or lesser rank along the way (with or without cus), as long as there are never more than 10 cus moving with a general at any time. the general being picked up must become a subordinate for that move. a general ending his move in a space with a higher ranking general becomes a subordinate; if they are of equal rank, the activated general is the commander. a subordinate general may be dropped off, or activated and moved off, with any number of cus, thus becoming the commanding general of their new army, possibly with subordinates of their own as long as they do not outrank him. a subordinate that detaches and moves off counts as moving 1 general. displaced generals a displaced general is removed from the map and does not return to play until the next reinforcement phase. a general is displaced if he is not accompanied by friendly cus and an enemy army enters his space, or if all his cus are eliminated due to retreat roll casualties, retreat losses, or the naval movement table (not attrition, storms at sea or the land battle casualties roll). in the hannibal scenarios, scipio africanus is eliminated if displaced. hannibal is eliminated if displaced and the carthaginian player must remove an additional 5 non-walled city, non tribe carthaginian pcs from any spaces on the map. campaign events a campaign event allows more than 1 general to be activated (not a single general multiple times). each commanding general must complete all movement and battles before the next general is activated. a cu or subordinate moved by a general during a campaign can be moved by another general during the same campaign as long as no cu or general moves more than 4 spaces (except nero, who can move 6 spaces). once an army is in a land battle, sieges/subjugates, backs up a space to avoid an interception, or fails a pursuit roll, all cus and generals in that army may not be moved by another general during that campaign. a campaign event cannot be used to conduct more than 1 siege or subjugation against the same walled city or tribe, but it can be used to battle the defenders from the space and then used again to conduct a siege or subjugation against the space, as long as a different general performed each action.naval movement a general, or a general with up to 5 cus (but not cus alone) may move from any port space to any other port space when a 3 op strategy card (ship icon in upper left) is played. a naval movement costs 3 mps. a campaign event allows one of the armies (with up to 10 cus) to use naval movement. you do not need to control a port to embark or disembark, and you may move into and out of any port space, including those that contain an enemy pc or cu (though an army’s movement must stop if it enters a space with enemy cus). naval movement may be directly into a walled city if it is friendly controlled and not besieged, though the movement can be into or out of a space containing a besieged walled city. in the hannibal scenarios, each time a carthaginian general or army moves by sea, the roman player rolls the naval movement die on the naval movement table: sunk: the cus are eliminated and the general is displaced. the cus lost do not count towards political consequences. return: the force must return to the port of embarkation and its remaining mps are lost. success: the naval movement is successful. land interception any army controlled by the non-active player may attempt an interception each time an enemy army or general enters a space (via land or naval movement) adjacent to the army and the space does not contain any non-moving enemy cus. you cannot intercept across any mountain pass or strait. you cannot intercept an attempt to avoid land battle, withdrawal, or retreat, and you cannot intercept an interception. declare which general and how many cus (max 10) are intercepting, and roll the die (+1 if the space you are intercepting into contains an enemy pc and no friendly cus). if the result is less than or equal to your commander’s battle rating (br), the interception is successful: move your intercepting force into the space. if there is then a land battle, the intercepting player gains 1 extra battle card. the original active player is still the attacker and plays the first battle card in the land battle. an intercepting army is never required to battle; it may instead back up to the space it most recently occupied and end its movement. if it has to back up across a pass, it must roll for attrition again. if it has to back up from a naval movement, it returns to its port of embarkation, rolling again on the naval movement table if appropriate (if the result is return it must stay and battle). if an army backs up into an enemy walled city or tribe space, it may still conduct a siege or subjugation on that space. multiple interceptions may be declared if you have more than 1 army adjacent to the space your opponent is about to enter; all must be declared first, then your opponent may wait until all are resolved before they decide to battle or back up. if more than 1 interception succeeds, the successful armies are combined in the space under the command of 1 general (the intercepting commander with the highest rank); if there is a tie for rank, the intercepting player may choose which is the commander. you may dispatch a portion of your army (under a subordinate or the commander) for an interception, declaring a general and a number of cus. only 1 interception can start from each space. if a subordinate intercepts, he becomes the commander of the intercepting force and the commanding general is left behind with at least 1 cu (consuls may not be left with fewer than 5 cus). an army inside a walled city may intercept an army in an adjacent space if there are no enemy cus outside the walled city. if you intercept an army that enters a walled city space by land movement, a land battle occurs, unless all cus retreat into the walled city. an army backing up a space may never leave behind cus outside the walled city. an army inside a walled city may not intercept an enemy army that enters the walled city space, nor can they intercept an enemy army that just left the walled city space. if an army fails an interception attempt, it cannot attempt an avoid land battle against that same army during the current card play. the army may attempt other interceptions without restrictions, and may even attempt to avoid land battle against other armies if the card in play is a campaign event. avoid land battle as non-active player, you may attempt to avoid land battle if an enemy army enters a space with one of your armies, or one or more of your generals without cus. if a die roll is less than or equal to your commander’s br, the attempt succeeds and you may move your generals or army (any in excess of 10 cus must be left behind) into any adjacent space. otherwise, a land battle is resolved with the failing army receiving 1 less battle card. generals without cus who fail are displaced. generals and cus that fail an interception attempt may not attempt to avoid land battle against the same army in the current round. an general or army avoiding land battle may leave generals and/ or cus behind; may not cross a mountain pass or strait; may not enter a space containing an enemy cu or pc; may not enter the space from which the enemy army is advancing; and may not enter a non-friendly tribe space. if avoiding battle with a subordinate, the commanding general must be left behind with at least 1 cu (5 cus if a consul). only 1 avoid land battle attempt is allowed per reaction phase, so generals may not split up and avoid land battle into different spaces, nor may you avoid land battle with 1 general after failing with another. after a successful avoid land battle, the active player may continue moving if a die roll is less than or equal to the general’s br and the army has not reached its movement limit. if you pursue the army that avoided battle, the avoiding army may attempt to avoid land battle again and you may attempt to pursue again, continuing until the avoid battle roll is failed or the general reaches his movement limit. an army outside a walled city may declare the army inside the city when the enemy army appears, or declare the army outside the city and attempt an avoid land battle. if the latter is successful, the army may then enter the walled city if it is empty of enemies. the active player would need to make a successful pursuit roll to keep moving. an army that fails its pursuit roll but ends its move on a walled city or tribe space may still conduct a siege or subjugation. battles a land battle is initiated when an army moves into a space with enemy cus that do not avoid battle. the moving army must end its movement. each player draws a number of battle cards (bcs): bcs equal to the commander’s br (if present) +1 bc for each cu in the land battle +1 bc if the battle was caused by a successful interception -1 bc for the non-active army if it unsuccessfully avoided battle a variable number for allies if a general is present +2 bcs for the roman player if the land battle is in latium +1 bc if the land battle space contains a friendly tribe the maximum hand (before taking into account elephant charges) is 20 cards. after battle all cards are shuffled back into the deck.allies a player gains allies by having political control of a province, and only if you have a general in the battle. each allied province is worth 1 bc, or 2 bc each for numidia major and numidia minor. allies in africa, iberia, and italia are available in any province within their region. allies in sicily are available in both provinces on the island (sicilia and syracusae). allies in the independent provinces (baleares, corsica/sardinia, gallia transalpina, massilia, liguria and, if in play, mauretania) are not available outside of their own provinces. the roman player may never receive more than 2 bcs for allies in italia. rome receives 2 extra bcs for any land battle that occurs in latium (in addition to any bcs for italian allies). this militia is available even if there is no general in roma. battle sequence 1. change of command die roll (consuls change positions on a roll of 4-6). 2. attacker plays land battle-related strategy cards. 3. defender plays land battle-related strategy cards. 4. elephant charge declaration and charge die roll, unless elephant fright is immediately played before the die roll. (hamilcar: -2 from the roll if forgotten tactics is in effect). 5. deal bcs, display cards revealed by spy in enemy camp, and begin land battle. a battle is fought in battle rounds. each round, the attacker plays a bc and then the defender must play a bc that matches it exactly. after each round, the defender may counterattack by rolling a die; if the roll is less than or equal to their commanding general’s br, they become the attacker in the next round. if the attacker plays a double envelopment card and the defender matches it, the defender automatically becomes the attacker if they wish. reserve cards can be used as a wild card; the type of card it represents must be stated by the player playing it, and it takes on all the characteristics of that card. successive rounds are played until the defender cannot or will not match a card, losing the battle. the defender wins if the attacker has no bcs remaining at the beginning of a battle round. land battle casualties after the battle, the winner rolls on the attrition table. cross- reference the number of cards played by the player who played the most bcs (including the last round; failed withdrawal attempts do not count as a round) with the die result to determine the cus lost by both sides. the winner also rolls a retreat die and consults their last played bc to determine the loser’s additional cu losses. roll the smaller die if the loser’s army began the land battle with 4 or less cus, or the larger die if they began with 5 or more cus. losses must be taken in cus (they cannot be absorbed with allies or militia). when the attacker loses by running out of cards, the victorious defender consults their last played bc to determine the loser’s cu losses. if there are elephant cus in the defeated army, the first cu removed must always be an elephant cu. all other losses may come from non-elephant cus. political consequences the loser must now remove a number of their own non-walled city, non-tribe pcs from anywhere on the map equal to half the number (round down) of cus they lost in the land battle. if unable to do so, the loser sues for peace and loses the game.retreats the loser of the land battle must retreat up to 4 spaces to a space both friendly controlled (contains a friendly pc) and clear of enemy cus, or to a space that contains more friendly cus. you may not leave behind any cus or generals. if you have a choice of spaces to retreat to, you must pick the closest (choose if there are several at equal distance). however you may choose a retreat path or destination that is not the closest if it causes fewer cu losses. after applying any retreat penalties, any friendly cus encountered along the retreat path (if they do not outnumber the retreating cus) become part of the retreating force. the 10 cus movement limit does not apply during retreats. the retreat may not cross a mountain pass or strait or use naval movement. if the losing army debarked in the battle space that round, it is eliminated, unless there is a friendly walled city it can retreat into (excess cus are eliminated). the original attacker must always retreat first into the space in which they entered the battle. if the original defender retreats, they can never enter the space from which the attacker entered the land battle. the retreating force may never reenter the land battle space during its retreat. a retreating force loses 1 additional cu for each space it enters that contains an enemy pc or non-friendly tribe. in an enemy- occupied space it loses an additional cu for each enemy cu there (and may not remain in such a space). enemy generals without cus have no effect on retreats and cannot block retreat paths (they are displaced if an enemy retreating force enters the space). a force that cannot retreat, has no place to retreat, or must retreat more than 4 spaces is eliminated. a retreating force may not retreat into a besieged walled city (except a force that sorties from the city). a retreating force may retreat into a friendly controlled non-besieged city if the land battle occurred in the walled city space. it may also split up: one force retreating into the city and one force retreating as normal (this is the only way a retreating force may be split up). withdrawals the current attacker may withdraw by forfeiting their chance to play a bc and rolling less than or equal to their commander’s br (only armies can attempt to withdraw). the defender may, if they wish, attempt to cancel the withdrawal by rolling less than or equal to their commanding general’s br. if the withdrawal does not happen, the defender may, if they wish, immediately become the attacker. there is no limit to the number of times you may attempt to withdraw in a single land battle. a successful withdrawal ends the land battle. the the withdrawing player must move their entire army (all cus) to an adjacent space (though units that sortie from a besieged walled city may withdraw back into it). battle casualties are resolved normally, but the retreat die roll is not used. there are no political consequences if a player successfully withdraws from a land battle. a withdrawing army may not split up; withdraw across a mountain pass, strait, or by naval movement; or withdraw into a space containing an enemy pc or enemy cu or a non-friendly tribe; or into the space from which the enemy army entered the land battle space. if the original attacker withdraws, they must withdraw to the space from which they advanced (even if it contains enemy pcs)."
99,63543,HORUS HERESY,2010,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,3.7683,164,"setup choose a scenario and sides, either randomly or by consensus (several methods are listed on p12 of the rules). lay out and assemble the board. each player takes a reference sheet, his side’s playing pieces, and shuffles and places facedown near himself his side’s combat deck and hero combat deck. the traitor player takes the extra bases used to convert imperial armies and imperial tank divisions into traitor armies and traitor tank divisions. ensure that any traitor armies and divisions are back on gray imperial bases before a new game. the imperial player takes the defense lasers and the emperor, rogal dorn, jaghatai khan, sanguinius, and the fabricator general. the traitor player takes horus, angron, fulgrim, mortarion, and magnus the red. shuffle and place the bombardment deck facedown on the table. place all hero damage markers on the first space of the hero damage track. place the imperial and traitor initiative markers on the first space of the initiative track with the traitor marker on top of the imperial marker. remaining markers and tokens are placed within reach of both players. each player places units and heroes on the main board according to the scenario’s unit setup instructions. all unused units, figures, bases, and heroes form the players’ stockpiles. assemble the event deck. for each act, find the event cards named and shuffle them facedown. if that act’s card list specifies that only some of those cards should be used, follow that instruction, returning unused cards to the box without looking at them. leave the resulting pile of cards facedown. stack the act piles on top of each other: the act i pile on top and subsequent act piles below it in order, until all of the piles have been assembled. corruption of imperial units. the traitor player chooses an imperial unit, from among the allowable unit types, that has been placed on the main map board. draw the top card from the bombardment deck: if it shows an imperial eagle, there is no effect. if it shows a chaos star, the unit is corrupted. if corrupted, the figure is placed on a traitor (black) base, but remains in the same area. the imperial base is returned to the imperial stockpile. drawn cards are discarded normally. carry out this procedure the number of times specified by the scenario. each imperial unit may only be placed in jeopardy of corruption once during setup. bombardment. the traitor player chooses a non-fortified area on the main map board, and decides whether this bombardment will be precise or reckless. draw the top card from the bombardment deck and applies the orbital result of the chosen type to the chosen area. drawn cards are discarded normally. carry out this procedure the number of times specified by the scenario. the same area may be bombarded multiple times. order card setup. each player removes all of his starting order cards (green skull in lower left corner) from his order deck. these cards form his starting hand of order cards. then follow any additional order card setup instructions. each player’s remaining order cards are shuffled to form his order deck and placed facedown near its owner. initiative and actions at the beginning of a round, the player whose initiative marker is closest to the start of the initiative track has initiative and is the current player. if both markers are on the same space, the player whose marker is on top is the current player. each round consists of the following steps: 1. action the current player chooses and resolves an action. each has an initiative cost paid during the advance initiative marker step. place an order choose an order card from your hand and place it facedown on the strategic map on one of the order stacks, for execution later. cost: 1 initiative point. execute order from strategic map choose and execute one of your order cards on top of one of the strategic map’s stacks. discard or recycle the card once the initiative cost is paid. you cannot execute orders placed since the last change of initiative (place them at 90º as a reminder). cost: 1 initiative point regardless of the cost printed on the order card. execute order from hand choose an order card in your hand and execute it in a chosen region. discard or recycle the card once its initiative cost is paid. cost: 0–3 initiative points, depending on the number of cost icons on the card. bury an order choose an order stack on the strategic map and move the top card (friendly or enemy) to the bottom of the stack without looking at it. cost: 1 initiative point. draw an order choose and draw 1 order card from your reserve, or draw the top card from your order deck, and add it to your hand. this action cannot be chosen if you already have 6 order cards in hand. cost: 1 initiative point. 2. advance initiative marker the current player’s initiative marker is moved toward the end of the initiative track a number of spaces equal to the action’s initiative cost. if his marker lands on his opponent’s marker’s space, the moving marker is placed on top. 3. change of initiative if the current player’s initiative marker is no longer closest to the start of the track, there is a change of initiative. if the markers are on the same space, there is only a change if the current player’s marker is below his opponent’s marker. on a change of initiative, two special activities occur: 1. coexistence battles: combat is carried out in all main map board areas where enemy forces co-exist. when there are multiple areas, the imperial player chooses the battle sequence. 2. stacking limits: after all coexistence battles have been resolved, stacking limits are checked and observed. if there is no change of initiative, nothing happens in this step. even when there is a change of initiative, the current player does not change until the next action round begins.4. re solve special phases a special phase is carried out for each special phase icon the current player’s initiative marker moved past or onto in the preceding advance initiative marker step; in the order in which they were moved past or onto. a particular space’s special phase is only addressed once per game. event phase the current player draws and executes the top card from the event deck. do immediately effects are carried out right away. draw orders phase each player may draw new order cards. starting with the current player, each player may discard any or all order cards from his hand. recyclable orders are placed in the player’s reserve rather than his discard pile. starting with the current player, each player may move any or all order cards from his reserve to his hand as long as he does not exceed 6 cards in his hand. each player with fewer than 6 cards in his hand draws cards from his order deck until he has 6 cards in his hand. refresh phase remove all activation markers from the main map board showing an activation icon. all routed activation markers are then flipped over to show their activation icons. order s players execute order cards either by placing them on the strategic map (place an order action) for execution later in the game (execute order from strategic map action), or executing them directly from their hand (execute order from hand action). players can also bury orders (bury an order action) and draw new order cards (draw an order action). the strategic map the strategic map is an abstract version of the main map. each region corresponds to a collection of areas on the main map, and has an order stack, where order cards are placed when players with the place an order action. the vengeful spirit’s order stack is near its areas. a player may only review a facedown order on the strategic map if it it belongs to him and is the top-most in its stack. fortress areas have dashed borders, and belong to all of the regions to which they are adjacent. the palace region consists only of the 7 contiguous fortified areas marked on the strategic map. the imperial plateau region consists of areas that together form a rough horseshoe shape. the only region division not denoted on the main map by either a crevasse or a fortification wall is in the north center. this border is marked by an orange dotted line and the words region division. executing orders an executed order always pertains to a particular region. if the order was executed from the strategic map, the region is determined by the stack the order came from. if it was executed from a player’s hand, he decides which region to target. when a player executes an order, he always has the option to ignore its effects and do nothing (no activation markers are placed). the initiative cost must be paid as normal, however. he may only control his own units, unless stated otherwise. when an order card with a strategic effect is executed from the strategic map (instead of from a player’s hand), its strategic effect is carried out in addition to its regular effect. recyclable orders and the reserve after an order has been executed, the card is discarded to its owner’s discard pile unless it has a recycle symbol, in which case it is placed in its owner’s reserve. this is a collection of faceup cards (tuck them halfway under the board) to which he has ready access during a draw orders phase. either player may review all of the cards in either player’s reserve at any time. activation markers place one of your activation markers (activation icon faceup) in each area activated by your order. you may not order units in an area that already has one of your activation markers in it. units from an unactivated area may move into a previously activated area. an order that would cause a second activation marker of the same type (imperial or traitor) to be placed in an area that already has one is ignored. an area is considered activated for a player whether its activation icon or rout icon is faceup. routed activation markers are, when ‘removed’, turned over to their activation icon side instead. movement movement orders allow one or more destination areas for movement to be chosen. units executing the order can begin their movement either inside or outside those regions. moving units spend movement points (mps) to move. a unit need not use up all its mps when moving. most have 2 mps, but some have special abilities that give them more mps. it costs 1 mp for a unit to move from one area to an adjacent area. if the border between them is a crevasse it costs 2 mp. a unit may only move into and through friendly or neutral areas. (an attack order is required to enter enemy or contested areas.) all moving units must end their move in a legal destination area described by their movement order. a unit that does not have enough mps to reach a legal destination may not move. fortifications do not affect movement. flying units pay only 1 mp to cross a crevasse, and may move through enemy and contested areas (but may not end their movement in one). flying transport when a flying transport unit begins its movement, or moves into any area, it may pick up a number of friendly units there up to its combat rating. it may not pick up units from an activated area. while moving, it may drop off the units in friendly or empty areas it travels through or ends its movement in. it may drop off units and then pick up others in the same area. the unit may pick up and drop off many units over the course of its movement, as long as the number of units in its payload never exceeds its combat rating. at the end of its movement, the flying transport unit must drop off all units. heroe s rules applying to units do not apply to heroes except where stated. some heroes begin play on the board according to the scenario’s setup instructions. heroes without specific setup instructions start in their owner’s stockpile from which they can can be introduced any time their owner may place units on the main map board from his stockpile. this placement does not “use up” any of the player’s capacity to place units; the hero placement is an additional benefit. heroes cannot be eliminated by defense lasers.hero special abilities each hero has one special ability common to all heroes, plus one or more individual special abilities described on their reference sheets. using a hero special ability at any given time is optional. heroes never have to “put back” hero combat cards if they are wounded during the course of a battle, because a hero’s special ability to draw hero combat cards only comes into play when the players are preparing to fight and drawing their cards. common special ability: hero combat cards: when at least one hero is present and engaged in battle, its owner may draw 2 hero combat cards and add them to his hand of combat cards at the start of a battle. only 2 hero combat cards may be drawn no matter how many heroes are engaged. this ability’s effectiveness is reduced for wounded heroes; but if wounded and unwounded heroes are both engaged on the same side, their player may still draw 2 hero combat cards. moving heroes heroes move via movement orders, and are considered units with 3 mps for the purposes of all movement orders’ effects. heroes are also considered units for the movement purposes of routing and retreating, and for the effects of event cards. unsupported heroes a hero in an area where there are no friendly units is an unsupported hero. he does not make the area he occupies friendly to his side, nor enemy to the opponent’s side (enemy units can move through or into the area). if enemy units co-exist in an area with an unsupported hero, this does trigger a coexistence battle during the change of initiative step. hero damage and elimination for each point of damage a hero sustains, his damage marker is moved one space toward the end of the hero damage track. the track has 3 sections: unwounded, wounded, and defeated. when a hero’s marker is in the unwounded section, he functions normally. in the wounded section, the hero only allows its owner to draw one hero combat card in battle. when a marker reaches the defeated space, that hero is eliminated; his marker is returned to the box and may not be re-introduced to play. when a hero is eliminated during battle, its owner must immediately draw a bombardment card for each of his units in that area. if the icon on the card drawn does not match the unit’s affiliation, that unit immediately routs. fortifications areas represented by protruding plastic pieces are fortified areas, and their borders are fortified borders. the vengeful spirit command center (circular area) is also a fortified area. when areas become fortified in the course of play, they are marked with fortification markers. there is no restriction on the types of units that can enter fortified areas. defending units in fortified areas subtract 2 from the regular damage the attacker generates in each of his active iterations. no units fighting a coexistence battle inside a fortified area gain any fortification advantages (but note rogal dorn’s special ability). units attacking from a fortified origin area gain no advantage. fortified borders do not affect movement unless related rule also apply.breaches a border segment (the length of border that an area shares with a single adjacent area) can only be breached once. two adjacent fortified areas are both breached if the border segment they share is breached. a breached border segment has a breach token placed over it. when an area fortified by a fortification marker is breached, remove the marker; that fortification’s effects on all its border segments are nullified. no breach tokens are placed. flying units attacking a fortified area cause the border between the target area and their origin area to be treated as breached as long as they are in battle. no breach token is placed. a defending force gains the full benefit of its fortifications only if all attacking units must cross an unbreached border segment between their origin areas and the battle’s target area. if any such borders are breached, the attacker’s total quantity of regular damage each iteration is reduced by 1, instead of by 2. fortifications and orbital bombardment a force inside a fortified area subtracts 2 damage from each orbital bombardment that affects it. if that area is breached on any of its border segments, subtract 1 damage instead. crevasse fortification crevasses are treated as fortified borders. defenders attacked by units that must all cross crevasses receive benefits as though they were defending a fortified area. however, if the defenders are attacked by units from multiple origin areas, some crossing crevasses and some not, the defenders receive no benefits of fortification. crevasses do not affect whether an area is considered fortified. thus, they are of no assistance against bombardments. crevasses cannot be breached (however flying units attacking across them treat them as breached). bom bardment both orbital bombardment and thunderhawk bombardment are resolved using the bombardment deck. rules and effects pertaining to “combat” or “battle” only affect the execution of a bombardment if combat is otherwise in effect. note the setup restriction against bombarding fortifications does not apply outside of setup. orbital bombardments 1. the bombarding player chooses an area on terra that will be subject to the bombardment. 2. the bombarding player declares whether his bombardment will be precise or reckless. 3. the bombarding player draws a bombardment card and references the appropriate orbital section. if the result is no effect, the card is discarded. damage is applied immediately. if a breach is specified, an adjacent fortified border segment is breached. the card is then discarded. damage is applied to the unit(s) present in the area; the bombarding player chooses how to divide the damage. all the damage must be assigned, if able. after destroying all enemy units in an area, a bombarding player must apply damage to his own units, if any are in the area. heroes are never damaged by bombardments. on a fortification breach, if multiple border segments of the target area are fortified, the bombarding player chooses one and places a breach marker there. a single bombardment never breaches more than one fortification border segment. if damage is also inflicted, the breach is inflicted first. thunderhawk bombardments the bombarding player draws the top bombardment card and applies the thunderhawk effect. damage “per thunderhawk,” means “per thunderhawk engaged in this combat.” damage is inflicted on the units in the target area (or origin areas, if the bombarding player is the defender) according to the same rules as orbital bombardments. thunderhawk bombardment damage can affect unengaged units in those areas. heroes are never damaged by thunderhawk bombardments. damage from thunderhawk bombardment is part of the special effect portion of the combat iteration. this damage is not part of “regular damage” and cannot be reduced with shields. once its effects have been applied, a bombardment card is discarded to the bombardment discard pile. defen se la sers when the traitor player executes port landing and drop pods orders, he first identifies the area where his units will land, and then chooses – from his stockpile and the traitor units on the vengeful spirit – which units he will attempt to land. the imperial player then determines how many defense lasers are in or adjacent to the landing area. he draws 1 card from the bombardment deck for each inbound unit, referring to the defense laser section and referencing the result that corresponds to the number of defense lasers. a hit result eliminates the inbound unit, disregarding its combat rank. miss has no effect. defense lasers cannot target inbound heroes.the imperial player must choose which inbound unit he is targeting before he draws each card, one bombardment card per inbound unit. a defense laser is not considered to be a unit. it cannot be issued orders, cannot move, does not count toward stacking limits, and cannot be involved in combat. a defense laser is destroyed immediately and returned to the box whenever the area it occupies becomes friendly to the traitor player. traitor armies & tank divisions traitor armies and traitor tank divisions function like other units, but are physically different. a traitor army unit is an imperial army figure attached to a rank i traitor base, and a traitor tank division unit is an imperial tank division figure attached to a rank ii traitor base. these units come into play when imperial armies and imperial tank divisions are corrupted. at the moment of corruption, the imperial unit is removed from its imperial base and placed on a traitor base. it becomes a traitor unit immediately and ceases to be an imperial unit; controlled by the traitor player until it is eliminated or the game ends. any damage sustained by a unit prior to its corruption remains. most scenarios call for the corruption of units during setup. when a corrupted unit is eliminated from play, its figure and base are separated and returned to their respective owners’ stockpiles. the figures can be remounted on imperial bases immediately; those units – like all stockpile units – are ready to enter play when orders or events call for them. the bases are ready to be used again when imperial units are corrupted again. iif the traitor player does not have sufficient bases of the appropriate type available, he can’t corrupt the corresponding unit type. areas areas can be divided into 4 types depending on which player’s units occupy them: neutral areas are those that contain no units from either side. note that an area containing only heroes is always neutral. contested areas are those that contain units from both sides. friendly areas are those that contain only units from a given player’s own side. enemy areas are those that contain only units from a given player’s opponent’s side. the vengeful spirit the vengeful spirit is a region whose 2 areas are adjacent to each other but not to any areas on terra. order cards pertaining to the vengeful spirit areas are placed in the labeled location in the upper righthand corner of the game board, which resembles the stacking locations on the strategic map. the imperial player has a “boarding action” order that allows movement between terra and the vengeful spirit, in both directions. the traitor player can use “port landing” orders in a special way to move units from any spaceport region to the vengeful spirit. to do this, the traitor player simply places a “port landing” order in the vengeful spirit region to move units from any spaceport area to either vengeful spirit area. the maximum combined combat ranks of units that may be moved is defined by the order. otherwise, the vengeful spirit areas observe all other game rules in the same way that areas on terra do. the vengeful spirit command center is a fortified area. stack ing l imits & deck management stacking limits each area on the main map board is subject to a stacking limit, usually of 6 units per side. all fortified areas have a limit of 3 units per side (fortified areas that become fortified by a fortification marker retain their original limit of 6 units). heroes and defense lasers are not units and do not count against an area’s stacking limit. stacking limits are only checked during the change of initiative step. each player must remove units of his choice from any area where he violates the stacking limit until he is no longer in violation. cards cards are discarded faceup into each deck’s discard pile unless directed otherwise, and the discard piles may not be examined unless directed otherwise. multiple discards may be discarded in any order, but must be announced. when a deck runs out, shuffle its discard pile to form a new deck. the event deck is never reshuffled. winning the game all victory conditions are immediate. death of the emperor or death of horus each player can win the game by eliminating his rival commander. spaceport victory once an initiative marker has moved on or past the spaceport victory space of the initiative track, a player wins if he is the only player with units (heroes are not units) present on all 4 spaceport areas. imperial hold-out victory if any initiative marker moves onto the imperial victory space, the imperial player wins the game.combat a battle occurs when one player executes an order that allows him to attack an area, and occasionally during a change of initiative step when units belonging to both players co-exist in the same area (ie, coexistance battles). one player in each battle is the attacker; the other is the defender. for the battle’s duration, these roles do not change. each battle is divided into a number of iterations. an attack order describes how many iterations are fought; unit coexistence battles have an 8 iteration limit. in each iteration, one player is active and the other passive. these roles alternate between iterations. the active player is attempting to damage his opponent, while the passive player is attempting to resist being damaged. a battle consists of the following steps: 1. joining battle the attacker, defender, target area, and one or more origin areas are identified. the player executing an attack order, becomes the attacker for the ensuing battle. his opponent becomes the defender. the order tells the attacker to choose a target area. this must include at least one enemy unit or hero. the order also tells the attacker the number of origin areas from which he may attack. these areas must be adjacent to the target area and must contain at least one of the attacker’s units. if the attacker has units in the target area, it becomes an origin area automatically, but does not count against the order’s limit on the number of origin areas that may be chosen. coexistence battle: the traitor player is always the defender; the imperial player is always the attacker. the area of coexistence is both the target area and the origin area. 2. engaging units the attacker specifies which units and heroes in the origin areas will engage in the battle, up to and including all of them. engaging a particular unit or hero brings its capabilities to bear, but it may be damaged or eliminated. all units and heroes in the target area, whether belonging to the defender or attacker, become engaged automatically. coexistence battle: all units and heroes present in the area are automatically engaged. flying units joining battles when a player with flying units executes an attack order and identifies a target area, his nearby flying units can immediately spend up to 3 mps to move to a friendly or neutral area that is adjacent to the target area.the area they move to must then be legally identified as an origin area for the attack (and counts toward the quantity of origin areas that the attack order allows), and the flying units in question must then be engaged in the battle. the area to which the units move becomes activated. flying units may not transport units to join battle in this way. coexistence battle: flying units may not join the battle. 3. preparing to fight both players draw a new hand of combat cards and hero combat cards from their decks as permitted by their engaged units and heroes. each player sums the combat ratings of his engaged units, divides that sum in half (rounding up), and draws that many cards. some order cards allow players to draw extra cards. each player with at least one engaged hero also draws 2 cards from his hero combat deck and adds those cards to his hand. if all engaged heroes on a player’s side are wounded, only 1 hero combat card is drawn. hero combat cards function just like regular combat cards in battle, though they are discarded to a separate discard pile. when a player is allowed to choose random cards from an opponent’s hand, they are allowed to see the card backs to assist in their choice. place the iteration marker on the first space of its track. 4. combat iterations the defender chooses the active player (ap) and the passive player (pp) in the first iteration of combat. these roles reverse in each subsequent iteration. in each combat iteration, carry out the following steps: 1. ap plays combat cards or retreats choose from your hand a number of cards up to the current iteration number and reveal them to your opponent. you may pass, in which case skip to step 6, then the next iteration begins. if you have no remaining combat cards in your hand you must pass. alternately, on any iteration except the first, you can retreat instead of playing combat cards. 2. ap carries out special effects from among the cards you played, choose and carry out up to 1 special effect that is not a free effect (free effect icon). you must be able to choose one of your engaged units meeting the effect’s unit requirement. if the special effect has a counter cost in brackets, the pp may discard that many shields (or more) from his own hand of combat cards to cancel the special effect. if your effect is canceled, you may not choose another.you may then choose and carry out, in any order, any number of free effects from among the combat cards you played. these free effects are carried out in the same way as regular special effects (may be countered, must meet requirements etc). 3. ap totals regular damage total your regular damage: the attack values for all of the combat cards you played, including those whose special effects you chose. sum the attack values for all of the combat cards you played, regardless of whether you met the unit requirement in the special effect area of the combat card. 4. pp resists regular damage the pp may discard a number of cards up to the current iteration number from his hand to resist your regular damage. for each shield icon on the pp’s discarded cards (ignore attack value and special effect), your regular damage is reduced by 1. damage cannot be reduced below 0. 5. ap assigns damage if any regular damage remains, assign it among your enemy’s engaged units in any way you choose. if the pp does not have any remaining units engaged in the battle, you may assign damage to his heroes. 6. iteration is advanced move the iteration marker 1 space forward on the iteration track. if this moves the marker past the number of iterations permitted by the order, the battle ends. coexistence battle: if this moves the iteration marker past the eighth space, the battle ends. the number of spaces on the iteration track does not limit a battle that would go on longer, given other rules allowing it. retreats during every combat iteration other than the first, the ap can retreat instead of playing combat cards. you cannot retreat if any of your engaged units are in an area that already has one of your routed activation markers in it. if the defender retreats, he must choose one friendly or neutral area adjacent to the target area and move all of his engaged units (and any heroes present) there. only flying units may retreat across a crevasse. the destination area of the retreat is marked with one of the retreating player’s routed activation markers. if the area already has an activation marker, flip it over. if the area already has a routed activation marker, don’t add a new one. if there is no adjacent friendly or neutral area, the defender may not retreat.if the attacker retreats, he does not move any units from their origin areas. those areas (i.e., those containing units that were engaged when the retreat was announced) are marked with routed activation markers as described for the defender, above. in both cases, the battle ends immediately. 5. end of battle the battle ends immediately once all allowed iterations have been resolved, all engaged units and heroes on one side have been eliminated, or both players have run out of combat cards and hero combat cards. if battle ends and no defending units remain in the target area, the attacker may move all, some, or none of his surviving engaged units and heroes there. otherwise, surviving engaged units and heroes remain in their respective origin or target area. any unused combat cards and hero combat cards are discarded; discard/recycle any attack order that initiated the battle. damage and unit elimination a unit that sustains a number of damage points equal to its combat rank is eliminated. partial damage persists: place a damage token bearing the amount of damage sustained in the unit’s base hook. previously sustained damage is cumulative with new damage. eliminated traitor units are returned to the box. traitor army/ traitor tank division units are taken apart and retained by their owners in their respective stockpiles. they may return to play. eliminated imperial units are returned to the box, except for imperial army, imperial tank division, and imperial titan units, which can return to play, and so are returned to the imperial stockpile when eliminated. routing if a defender’s unit routs, it is removed from the battle and moved to any friendly or neutral area of the unit owner’s choice adjacent to the battle’s target area. if no such area exists, if the target area already contains one of the defender’s routed activation markers, or the defender wishes, the unit is eliminated instead. if an attacking unit routs, it is removed from the battle and remains in its origin area, unless that area is already marked with one of the attacker’s routed activation markers, in which case the unit is eliminated. only flying units may rout across a crevasse. any area to which a unit routs is marked with a routed activation marker. if one of that side’s activation markers was already present with its activation icon face-up, flip it over so that the routed side is faceup. if one of that side’s routed activation markers was already present, no additional marker is added."

add one at the beginning of the next siege. playing a siege on his turn, a player may take one of these actions: – place a card from his hand faceup in front of him; – attack an opponent with one of the cards in front of him; – pass his turn. play then proceeds to the next player clockwise. placing a card on the table cards are always placed so they are visible to all players. once placed they cannot be moved. chariot, elephant, ballista, catapult, harrow and trojan horse cards are always placed by themselves. hoplites can be placed separately beside each other or stacked on hoplite cards placed earlier to form a phalanx, or on an elephant or trojan horse placed earlier. the value of the cards in a phalanx must decrease, from strongest, placed first, to weakest. the value is equal to the sum of the points multiplied by the number of cards in it. archers can be placed either separately or on an elephant or trojan horse. the value of the hoplites and/or archers on an elephant (maximum 2) is doubled. hoplites and/or archers on a trojan horse are placed facedown and only revealed at the end of the siege, when they can be placed by themselves, added to phalanxes, or placed on an elephant.attacking an opponent’s army except for the chariot, a player may never attack an opponent with a card directly from his hand. only one card placed from an earlier turn may be used, and it is discarded along with the target card. cards that a card can eliminate are shown on the left side of the card. hoplites, elephant, harrow and trojan horse cards can never attack. when hoplites are eliminated they are either solitary cards or the weakest value card in a phalanx (unless the attacker is an archers card sitting on an elephant). a player can never directly attack a card sitting on an elephant or trojan horse. passing when a player in a thanatos siege passes, he immediately takes the highest value hero card still available and places it by itself in front of him. this value is added to his army at the end of the siege. once a player passes he can no longer place or use cards in that siege, though he can still be attacked. his hero may never be eliminated. if only one player remains, he may place or use cards for as long as he wishes. when a player in a gorgon siege passes, he does not receive a hero card, but immediately discards all his army cards in front of him and no longer participates in that siege. athena and poseidon tiles the player whose total value of city cards is highest immediately takes the athena tile. the tile changes hands only when a player has more city points than the player who currently has the tile. in the same way, the poseidon tile is awarded immediately to the player with the highest value of trireme cards. new siege each player returns his hero card to the table and discards all the army cards in front of him. players keep the cards they have in hand but receive 3 new army cards. those who have more than 12 must discard down to 12. shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw deck if necessary. place new oracle and victory cards on the table. end of the game a player immediately wins as soon as the total of his victory cards (including the agamemnon, athena and poseidon tiles and subtracting the thanatos card) reaches 12 points. if the deck of oracle cards finishes before there is a winner, the player with the most points wins. if there is a tie, the tied players only receive 3 new army cards to add to their hands and start a new gorgon siege; the winner of this siege is the final winner. if neither of the players have the agamemnon tile, the player who had the hero of the highest value during the previous siege starts. 2 player rules the oracle and hero cards are not used. at the beginning of each siege, reveal 2 victory cards. a player who passes may still play thereafter during that siege, even passing for several turns as long as his opponent continues to play. the siege stops when both players pass in turn. the player with the strongest army chooses a victory card; the loser does not get one. if there is a tie, the loser is the last player to have passed. a new victory card is added to the remaining one and a new siege starts as normal. the winner is the first player with 15 victory points. playing in teams play as for a normal game, as individuals, but in 2 or 3 teams of 2. with 6 players (3 teams of 2), deal 10 army cards to each player. no player can have more than 10 cards in hand. to determine the winning team tally the total points of both partners. the winner is the first team with 15 victory points."

(space 6). hooper: take the fish finder token. place the blue hooper meeple in the white hooper’s boat meeple at the dock on the western side of the island (space 5). shark: attach a clip to your character board and slide it over the 0 slot at the bottom of the swimmer track. take the 4 power tokens and the shark meeple (do not place the shark meeple on the board). keep the power tokens secret from the crew. take the shark tracker pad and a pencil. choose a starting location from among the 12 spaces that contain water. pick a space and write the corresponding number or letter in the location column next to start. do not tell the crew your starting location. all of the shark’s movement is recorded on the shark tracker pad and kept secret from the crew. round sequence act 1 is played in rounds, each of which consists of 3 phases, played in this order: 1: event phase draw the top card of the amity event deck and place swimmers from the supply into the water of the beach spaces according to the letters shown next to the swimmer icon.michael (brody’s son) is a special swimmer token. when placing swimmers, do not place michael; only place him if an event card specifically says to do so. next, read the event text aloud and follow the instructions. 2. shark phase the shark may take up to 3 actions and may choose to play 1 power token. actions can be taken multiple times in any order. do not show or tell your actions to the crew. actions move move through water to an adjacent space. diagonal spaces are not adjacent, and you cannot move across land. eat 1 swimmer eat 1 swimmer in your space. after you’ve planned your entire turn, record it on your shark tracker pad. then announce that your turn is over and give the crew this information: swimmers eaten tell the crew how many swimmers you ate and at what beach. remove the corresponding swimmers from the board and return them to the supply, then slide the clip up the swimmer track on your character board 1 slot for each swimmer you ate. if your swimmer track reaches the 9 slot, act 1 immediately ends. motion sensors at any point during your turn, if you are in a space with a floating barrel, you trigger its motion sensor. at the end of your turn, you must inform the crew of any barrels whose motion sensors you triggered. you do not have to say when you triggered them—whether it was before or after eating swimmers—or in what order you triggered them if you triggered multiple motion sensors. power token each power token gives you a special ability in the round it is played. each may be used only once per game. if you play a power token, inform the crew and place the token facedown in front of you. do not tell the crew which token you are playing. power tokens feeding frenzy you may eat all swimmers in your space as 1 action. evasive moves you do not trigger any motion sensors this round, even if you move through spaces with floating barrels. out of sight if brody uses his binoculars or if hooper uses his fish finder this round, tell them you are not there or nearby, even if this is not true. the token is returned to the box at the end of the round, even if the crew took neither search action. if quint launches a barrel into your space, you must still announce that you’ve been hit. speed burst you may move up to 3 spaces as 1 action. this may be done only once. any other move actions you take are 1 space, as normal. 3. crew phase each crew member may take up to 4 actions. the crew may take their turns in any order, but once a crew member starts their turn, they must finish it before the next takes their turn. each crew member has different actions. they can be taken multiple times (unless stated otherwise) and in any order.quint move move through water to an adjacent space. diagonal spaces are not adjacent, and you cannot move across land. rescue 1 swimmer remove 1 swimmer from your space and return it to the supply. pick up barrels pick up any number of barrels in your space from either a dock, the water, or hooper’s boat. each source is a separate action. launch a barrel (once per round) quint launches barrels into the water using a harpoon gun on the orca. you may launch a barrel into your own space or an adjacent space. diagonal spaces are not adjacent. you cannot launch a barrel over land. place the barrel token in the space you are targeting. the shark must announce if they are in that space. if the shark is there, it is hit and the barrel is attached to it: place the barrel on the shark’s character board. if this is the second barrel attached to the shark, act 1 immediately ends. if the shark is not in that space, the barrel remains in the water. it is now a floating barrel with a motion sensor the shark might trigger in future rounds. brody move move across land to an adjacent space. diagonal spaces are not adjacent, and you cannot move through water. rescue 1 swimmer remove 1 swimmer from your space and return it to the supply. pick up 1 barrel if you are at the shop, pick up 1 barrel. place the barrel under your meeple to indicate you are carrying it. you may carry only 1 barrel at a time. drop 1 barrel if you are at a dock and carrying a barrel, drop it by placing the barrel on the dock’s barrel symbol. there is no limit to the number of barrels that can be at a dock. use binoculars (once per round) if you are at one of the 4 beach spaces, place the binoculars token on your space. the shark must announce if they are in the water at that beach. if they are, place the shark meeple there. if the shark played the out of sight power token this round, they will tell you that they are not there in any case. close a beach (once per round) if you are at the mayor’s office or the amity p.d., close any beach, as long as it has no swimmers. place the beach closed token faceup on the beach. when an event card would have you place one or more swimmers at that beach, do not place them, but instead flip over the token so it shows opening soon. the next time an event card would have you place one or more swimmers at that beach, do not place them, but instead remove the beach closed token from the board. only 1 beach can be closed at any given time. if a beach is closed, you may take this action to close a different beach. move the beach closed token to the newly closed beach and turn it faceup.hooper move move up to 2 spaces as 1 action. each move must be through water to an adjacent space. diagonal spaces are not adjacent, and you cannot move across land. rescue 1 swimmer remove 1 swimmer from your space and return it to the supply. pick up barrels pick up any number of barrels in your space from either a dock or the water. each source is a separate action. give barrels to quint if you are in the same space as quint, give him all the barrels you have on your boat. place the barrels next to quint’s character board to indicate they are now on the orca. hooper cannot launch barrels into the water. use fish finder (once per round) place the fish finder token in the water in your space. the shark must announce where they are in relation to the fish finder. • if the shark is in the same space, they must tell you. place the shark meeple there. • if the shark is in an adjacent space that is connected by water, they must tell you they are “nearby. ” diagonal spaces are not adjacent. • if the shark is neither in the same space nor an adjacent space, they must tell you they are “not there or nearby. ” if the shark played the out of sight power token this round, they will tell you that they are not there or nearby in any case. end of the round after all 3 crew members have taken their turn, the round is over. if the shark played a power token that round, return it facedown to the box. begin a new round, starting with the event phase. end of act 1 act 1 ends immediately if one of the following happens: 1. the crew attaches a second barrel to the shark. 2. the swimmer track on the shark’s board reaches the 9 slot. start act 2. do not move the clip on the swimmer track yet. act 2: the orca shark goal: eliminate all 3 crew members or completely destroy the orca. crew goal: eliminate the shark. setup shuffle the shark ability cards and randomly give the shark the number of cards indicated by the swimmer track on their character board from act 1. the shark player may look at their cards, but should keep them hidden from the crew. give each crew member their 2 corresponding gear cards and their target token. shuffle the crew gear cards and randomly give the crew (as a group) the number of cards indicated by the shark’s swimmer track. the crew divides these cards among the 3 crew members however they choose. each crew member places all of their gear cards faceup next to their character board. flip all 4 character boards to the act 2 side. attach a clip to each character board and slide it over the 0 slot at the top of the wound track. flip the board to the orca: act 2 side. build the orca by placing 1 boat tile in each of the 8 zones on the board. each tile should show the undamaged side. shuffle the resurface cards and place them facedown in a deck on the deck spot on the board. each crew member places their meeple on a boat space of their choice. any number of crew members can share a space. give the shark player the 3 large resurface tokens and the shark meeple. place the 3 small resurface tokens and the 3 dice next to the board. round sequence act 2 is played in rounds, each of which consists of 6 steps, played in this order: 1: resurface options turn over the top 3 resurface cards and place 1 faceup on each spot (a, b, or c) on the board. the cards should be rotated so the boat outline matches the orientation of the orca on the board. these are the shark’s 3 resurface options for this round. the resurface zone (highlighted in red) is the zone where the shark will resurface if they choose that card. place the small resurface tokens (a, b, and c) in the water spaces of the corresponding zones so players can more easily see all of the resurface options for the round. if the resurface cards run out, shuffle the discard pile to create a new deck. 2. shark chooses the shark secretly selects one of the 3 resurface cards by playing a large resurface token (a, b, or c) facedown in front of them. the shark may also play 1 shark ability card from their hand by placing the card facedown underneath their resurface token. each ability is active during the round in which the card is played. the card is removed from the game at the end of the round, whether the ability was used or not. 3. crew prepares the crew prepares for the shark’s appearance by moving (optional), choosing weapons, and placing target tokens. the crew may discuss their options and intentions, but they should not discuss them until after the shark has locked in their resurface token in step 2. move each crew member may move up to 2 adjacent spaces. you may move through boat and/or water spaces. however, moving from a water space onto an adjacent boat space requires climbing back onto the boat and takes both of your moves.choose weapon each crew member chooses 1 weapon from their crew gear cards. there are 3 types, designated by the symbol in the card’s top-left corner. melee weapons: these are close-range weapons that allow you to roll dice to inflict wounds on the shark. firearm weapons: these also allow you to roll dice to inflict wounds on the shark, but they may be used at any range. attachable weapon: these are close-range weapons that are attached to the shark and hinder it. the effect remains active for as long as the weapon is attached to the shark. each crew member places their chosen weapon card above their character board. place target token each crew member places their target token in the water space of the zone where they think the shark will resurface. multiple crew members may target the same space. if you are using a melee weapon or an attachable weapon, you must be in the same space or adjacent to the water space you are targeting. if you are using a firearm weapon, you may target any water space, regardless of where you are. accessories crew gear cards that do not have a symbol in the top-left corner are accessories that can be used in addition to weapons. the 3 types are: chum: after the shark locks in their resurface token in step 2, chum may be played. the shark must reveal 1 of the 2 resurface tokens that they did not choose. this gives the crew a better chance of predicting where the shark will resurface. only 1 chum card may be played each round. ammo: the pistol and rifle are each loaded with 1 shot. extra ammo lets you discard the ammo instead of the weapon after firing, saving the weapon for use in a later round. shark cage: the shark cage may be played before the shark rolls for an attack. the crew member who uses it cannot take any wounds in the round in which it is played. step 4: shark reveals the shark flips over their chosen resurface token. discard the 2 resurface cards that were not chosen. place the shark meeple in the chosen zone’s water space and return all target tokens that are not in that space. if the shark played a shark ability card, it is also revealed at this time and its ability goes into effect. shake off if the chosen resurface card has a shake off symbol, the shark shakes off (discards) all attachable weapons attached to them. at the start of act 2, each zone has 2 spaces: a boat space and a water space. after a boat tile is destroyed (removed from the game), that zone will only have 1 large water space. borders of all spaces are defined by white lines and tile edges.two spaces are adjacent if they share a border (white line or tile edge). diagonal spaces are not adjacent. as the boat gets damaged, different spaces will gain or lose adjacency. step 5: crew attacks each crew member who targeted the correct zone may attack the shark. crew members may attack in any order. crew members who targeted the wrong zone do not attack. when you attack the shark, do the following, depending on what type of weapon you used: melee weapon or firearm weapon roll the number of dice shown on the card and add up the number of hits rolled. if the weapon has + , add 1 hit to the total. if the total number of hits is equal to or less than the shark’s evade value (shown on the resurface card), the attack misses and the shark takes no wounds. if the total number of hits is higher than the shark’s evade value, the attack is successful. subtract the evade value from the total number of hits, and the shark takes that many wounds. the shark slides the clip on their wound track 1 slot for each wound taken. check the weapon for abilities that affect how they are used. attachable weapon automatically attach the weapon to the shark (place the card faceup in front of the shark). you do not need to roll the dice, and the shark’s evade value has no effect. the weapon’s ability immediately goes into effect and stays in effect until the shark is able to shake it off. step 6: shark attacks the shark may choose to attack either the boat or a crew member in the water. attack the boat you may choose 1 boat space to attack. you must be adjacent to the boat space you are targeting. announce which boat space you are attacking. roll the number of dice shown on the resurface card, and total the number of hits. apply the results, based on the hits needed to damage or destroy the boat space. the undamaged side of each boat tile shows 2 numbers: the smaller number is the number of hits the shark must roll to damage the boat space, and the larger number is the number of hits required to destroy it. the damaged side of each boat tile shows one number: this number is the number of hits required to destroy the boat space. if you did not roll enough hits to damage the boat space, the attack misses. if you did roll enough hits, flip the boat tile to the damaged side. if you rolled enough hits to destroy the boat space, remove the boat tile from the game board. if a boat space gets damaged or destroyed, all crew members that were on that boat space fall into the water. after flipping or removing the boat tile, place their meeple(s) in the water space of that zone.attack a crew member you may choose 1 crew member to attack. the crew member must be in the water, and they must be in your space or an adjacent water space. you may not attack a crew member who is on the boat. announce which crew member you are attacking, then roll the number of dice shown on the resurface card. the crew member takes 1 wound for each hit rolled. the crew member slides the clip on their wound track 1 slot for each wound taken. bonus attack(s) before going underwater again, the shark may roll a bonus attack against each crew member that is in the water near them. one at a time, roll 1 die against each crew member that is in your space or an adjacent water space. the targeted crew members take 1 wound for each hit rolled. eliminating crew members if a crew member’s wound tracker reaches , they have been eliminated from the game. remove their crew meeple from the board and discard all of their gear cards. end of the round after the shark finishes their attack and any bonus attacks, the round is over and the shark dives back into the depths. remove the shark meeple from the board, return all target tokens to their respective crew members, and discard the faceup resurface card and the shark ability card (if one was used). begin a new round, starting with step 1. end of the game the game can end in one of 3 ways: 1. if all 3 crew members have been eliminated, the shark wins. 2. if the orca has been destroyed (all boat tiles have been removed), the shark wins. 3. if the shark’s wound tracker reaches , the shark is eliminated and the crew wins. playing act 1 or act 2 separately either act 1 or act 2 may be played as a standalone game with these modifications: act 1 if the shark’s swimmer track reaches the 7 slot (or higher), the game ends immediately and the shark wins. if the crew attaches a second barrel to the shark before the swimmer track reaches 7, the game ends immediately and the crew wins. act 2 during setup, give the shark 6 random shark ability cards. give each crew member their corresponding gear cards, then give the crew (as a group) 7 random crew gear cards, which they immediately divide among the 3 crew members however they choose."
105,73761,K2,2010,REBEL.PL,2.2544,570,"setup choose which side of the board to use: the easier or harder route. the tables in each altitude zone on the board indicate the maximum number of mountaineers that can occupy a space, depending on the number of players. above 7000 meters with 5 players there are additional figures in red: players should agree whether to use the larger maximum number of mountaineers (easier) or the smaller maximum number (harder). each player chooses a color and takes the matching 4 mountaineers, 2 tents, 2 acclimatization markers, player mat, set of 18 player cards, and—if playing the family variant—a rescue card. each player puts 2 differently shaped mountaineers on the start space of the board, and 2 differently shaped ones on the lowest score space. a player’s acclimatization markers go on the 1 value spaces on his player mat. choose one of the sets of weather tiles (summer is easier, and winter is harder; it doesn’t matter which side of the board is being used) and return the unused set to the box. shuffle the weather tiles and deal 2 of them faceup above the board to form a sequence of six spaces (days) with weather values. place the other tiles in a stack under the second weather tile. place the black weather marker on the first day (on the leftmost space of the left weather tile). place the cardboard risk tokens in a facedown pool; then randomly reveal 3 faceup. each player shuffles their deck of cards (except the rescue card) and deals themselves a hand of 6 cards. the player who was most recently in the mountains takes the starting player marker. sequence of play the game is played for 18 turns (an 18 day expedition). each turn is divided into several phases, played in sequence. the phases are played by players simultaneously, except for phase 3. 1. card selection all players select 3 cards out of the 6 in their hand, placing the 3 cards facedown in front of themselves. when all players have chosen their cards, they are revealed simultaneously. 2. risk tokens players add up the movement points (mps) on their 3 selected cards. for rope cards (different movement values up and down), only the upward movement value is added. acclimatization cards (number in a blue circle) are not counted. the player with the highest mp sum chooses one of the 3 visible risk tokens and puts it beside their 3 selected cards for this turn. on a tie for the most mps, no player takes a risk token. finally, 1 of the hidden risk tokens is drawn and placed faceup so once again 3 risk tokens are visible.3. action phase players play one after the other, starting with the player with the starting player marker and going clockwise. you may take more than 1 action as long as you have enough cards. a player who holds a risk token during their turn has to suffer the consequences. climber movement you may use movement cards to move a mountaineer with the number of mps shown on the cards, up or down. indicate the mountaineer who will move and the card or cards to be used. the amount of usable mps is the sum of the points (in green circles) on the cards. a mountaineer can move only between adjacent spaces (connected with rope). the cost to enter a space is marked in a yellow circle in that space. lf the space has no cost shown, it costs 1 mp to enter. a rope card gives mps in one chosen direction: use the ‘up’ points when moving up (ie, along a rope where the carabiner is attached to the destination space), or the ‘down’ points only when moving down. for other movement cards, the movement direction is not relevant. during a single move, you may change direction as desired, but ‘down’ points from a rope card can only be used for moving down. mps from one card may not be divided between 2 mountaineers. you do not have to use all the mps, and you do not have to move a mountaineer at all. a space can only have as many mountaineers as indicated in the table in that altitude zone on the board, depending on the number of players (and the pre-game decision whether to allow extra mountaineers on 7000m+ spaces or not). a mountaineer can pass through a space with the maximum number of mountaineers, paying the appropriate number of mps, as long as he doesn’t stop there. marking victory points (vps) every time a mountaineer successfully goes higher (to a space with more vps—the number in the green flag), that mountaineer’s marker is moved up the victory point track to the corresponding value. when a mountaineer goes lower, the corresponding vp marker does not change its position. the vp marker of the first mountaineer to reach the peak is placed at the top of that vp space. mountaineers who reach the peak afterward arrange their markers in order below it. raising acclimatization level add acclimatization points to mountaineers according to the played cards. points from one card cannot be divided between 2 mountaineers, but a mountaineer can receive points from multiple cards. add points by moving the marker on your player mat on the track corresponding to the given mountaineer. pitching a tent a mountaineer can pitch a tent on his current space by spending as many mps as the space’s entry cost and place the mountaineer’s corresponding tent. in the case of rope cards, only upward mps can be spent on a tent.each mountaineer can pitch only 1 tent during the game. a tent cannot be moved; once placed, it remains in that space until the end of the game. with enough mps, a mountaineer can enter a space and place a tent there in 1 turn. a space can have more than 1 tent. risk tokens if you have a risk token, it must be applied. if the token has a value of 0, nothing happens. if the token has a value of 1, you must subtract 1 point from mps or acclimatization points; in one of 3 ways: • subtract 1 mp from one of the played cards; • subtract 1 acclimatization point from one of the played cards; • subtract 1 point from the acclimatization level of a mountaineer to whom at least 1 card was assigned this turn. in the case of rope cards, you must decide whether the mountaineer will use it to move up or down, and subtract the risk token point from the selected value. a mountaineer who does not move in a given turn and who did not receive acclimatization points cannot suffer the consequences of a risk token. if the risk token has a value of 2, you must subtract 2 points as described above. you can divide the penalty points between movement and acclimatization points, and even between mountaineers. remember, the penalty can only be applied to a mountaineer who is moving or getting acclimatization points due to card play. weather influence each weather tile shows the weather forecast for the next 3 days, giving information about the weather which will affect a given altitude zone (or zones) and about the effects (modifiers) which mountaineers in this zone will suffer. the marker on the weather tile shows the current weather conditions for climbing. red circles are acclimatization symbols with the number of points which every climber in the given altitude zone (or zones) must subtract from their acclimatization level in phase 4 (acclimatization checks). yellow circles means entering every space in the given zone costs the indicated number of additional mps (both moving up and down). this also applies to placing a tent. red and yellow circles means that both symbols work at the same time, as above. blue circles mean no weather modifiers. 4. acclimatization checks checking each mountaineer separately, add or subtract the appropriate number of acclimatization points by adjusting the marker on the climber’s track on the player’s mat. • if the mountaineer is on a space with favorable acclimatization (blue circle), add acclimatization points equal to the number in the circle. if the mountaineer is on a space with unfavorable acclimatization (red circle), the number is subtracted. • if the space has a tent with the same color as the mountaineer (not necessarily that specific mountaineer’s tent), the mountaineer gains 1 acclimatization point. • if the current weather affects the zone where the mountaineer is, then the mountaineer loses the indicated number of acclimatization points. at the end of this phase, any mountaineer’s acclimatization level which is greater than 6 is reduced to 6. if any mountaineer’s acclimatization level drops below 1, that mountaineer dies. that mountaineer’s vps are reduced to 1, and he is removed from the board. family variant if using the family variant, when one of your mountaineers dies, you can use your rescue card to save the mountaineer, moving him to any space at an altitude below 6000 meters. the vp marker for that mountaineer must be moved backward 4 spaces. your rescue card can only be used once; return it to the box after use. 5. end of turn the player to the left of the starting player receives the starting player marker. the weather marker is advanced to the next space on the weather tile. if it moves onto the first space of the weather tile on the right side, move this tile to the left side, revealing a new one on the right side. if the marker is moved onto the last tile (you can not reveal a new tile), then only 3 days remain until the end of the game. after moving the weather marker, all players draw 3 more cards to have 6 in their hands. if there are no more cards to draw, in the next turn players will have only 3 cards to play. only when the players have no cards left in their hands do they shuffle their cards and draw 6 new cards. game end the game ends at the end of the last (18th) day, when all weather tiles have run out. whoever has the highest sum of vps from their 2 mountaineers is the winner. on a tie, the winner is the tied player whose climber reached the peak first (as indicated by the order of markers on the peak’s vp space). otherwise the players with the highest total points tie. solo play when playing solo, the games rules are the same. the maximum number of climbers in a given space is the same as a 2 player game. always take a risk token, no matter what cards are played. if one of the mountaineers dies, the game ends immediately, and you gain as many victory points as the surviving climber scored, plus 1 vp for the dead mountaineer. then compare the number of vps with the table in the rules to discover the victory level achieved."
106,269385,LORD OF THE RINGS JOURNEYS IN MIDDLE-EARTH,2019,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,2.6329,425,"first campaign setup select the new game button on the app’s title screen and follow the screens for selecting a campaign, a difficulty, and a save slot. each player selects a hero in the app to use for the campaign, then takes their hero’s figure and hero card. if playing solo, choose 2 heroes and control both. each player selects their starting items, takes the item cards that match the name and tier displayed in the app, and places them near their hero card. shuffle the damage cards, fear cards, and weakness skill cards (not the other skill cards) into separate decks. separate the exploration/inspiration, search/ threat, person, and enemy banner tokens, plus the 3 types of boon cards, into separate piles to create the supply. input a group name in the app, then select begin and watch the cutscene. each player selects a role in the app for the first adventure. the recommended starting role for each hero is aragorn: captain; beravor: pathfinder; bilbo: burglar; elena: musician; gimli: guardian; and legolas: hunter. heroes will be able to change roles between adventures. each player takes the following 15 skill cards: 1 copy of each card numbered 1-6 with the word basic on the bottom of the card; the skill cards numbered 1-5 with the name of your hero on the bottom of the card; the skill cards numbered 1-3 with your role on the bottom of the card; and 1 weakness card from the weakness deck. place the starting skill card for your role (with the number 1 after the role name at the bottom of the card and stars next to the card name) faceup below your hero card. then, shuffle your remaining 14 cards together to create your skill deck and place it facedown in front of you. select embark in the app and follow the instructions, placing map tiles and tokens as shown. playing the game the game is played over a series of rounds, each of which has 3 phases that players resolve in order: 1. action phase heroes take turns in the order of their choice (the order can change from round to round). during your hero’s turn, you can perform up to 2 actions, which may be the same action twice. after all heroes have taken a turn, select the hourglass button in the lower-right corner of the app screen to proceed to the shadow phase.travel action the map is made up of map tiles, each of which is divided into spaces enclosed by gray borders. spaces that share a gray border are adjacent to each other. spaces separated by black borders are not adjacent unless they are connected by gray borders that are aligned together. when you perform a travel action, you can move twice. each time you move, move to an adjacent space. you can interrupt your moves to perform the second action of your turn. each map tile has a square box where an exploration token may be placed, as indicated by the app. a map tile with an exploration token on it is unexplored. when you move into any space on an unexplored tile, you must immediately explore the tile. select the appropriate exploration token in the app, select the confirm button, and follow the instructions. exploring a tile does not require that the hero ends their movement in a space in that tile. exploring a tile is not a separate action: it is the result of a hero moving onto a tile that has an exploration token. attack action to attack an enemy group (one or more plastic figures of the same type that move an attack together), choose an item with a stat icon in the upper-left corner to attack with, then choose 1 enemy group in range. an enemy group in the same space as the hero is in range. an enemy group in a space adjacent to the hero is also in range if you are attacking with an item card with the ranged icon . then resolve an attack test against that enemy group. interact action if you are in the same space as a search, person, or threat token, perform an interact action by selecting the token in the app, then selecting the button with the action icon and following the instructions. then, continue your turn. you can inspect tokens in the app at any time by selecting them and reading their text. inspecting is not an action, and you can select the cancel button to close the token’s description. however, if you select the button with the icon, you are performing an interact action and must meet its requirements. 2. shadow phase the app guides players through these steps: enemy activation each enemy group attempts to move and attack. first, the enemy group moves up to the indicated number of spaces toward the targeted hero, taking the shortest path of spaces possible. it stops when it is in range of that hero (if it is in the hero’s space or if it is in an adjacent space and has the ranged icon on its portrait).if the enemy group cannot get in range of its target but can get in range of another hero, that closer hero becomes the new target. if multiple heroes satisfy this condition, the heroes choose which one becomes the new target. if the enemy can get in range of a target, the attack button is selected and the app displays the amount of damage and fear that the hero might suffer. if the enemy group cannot get in range of any target, it ignores the entire instruction and the no target button is selected. this provides the enemy with a new instruction (usually moving the enemy closer to a hero). darkness only resolve this step when the app instructs you to. a hero is in darkness if any of these conditions apply: • they are in a space with a printed darkness icon. • they are in a space with a darkness token. • the app states that they are in darkness. each hero in darkness suffers an amount of fear indicated by the app. threat threat is represented by a threat bar at the top of the app screen. when threat increases to a threshold’s number, a threat event is activated in the app and heroes resolve it by following its instructions. if the threat bar ever fills completely, the game ends and the heroes fail the adventure. threat increases during each threat step by: • 2 for each hero playing • 1 for each threat token on the map • 1 for each unexplored tile some effects can cause threat to increase during other game phases. at any time, you can select a threshold in the app to view a brief description of its event. 3. rally phase first, each hero resets their skill deck by shuffling their discard pile into their deck. then, the app instructs the heroes to scout 2. each player reveals the top 2 cards of their skill deck, and may prepare one of them by placing it below their hero card. if a card is prepared, the abilities on that card are available to be used. you can only have 4 skill cards prepared at a time. if you ever have more than 4, you must discard cards until only 4 prepared cards remain. after choosing whether or not to prepare a card, each hero places their cards that were not prepared on the top or bottom of their deck in any order. after scouting, select the continue button and proceed to a new round, starting with the action phase.completing an adventure the heroes win or lose an adventure together. in any case, all of them proceed to the next adventure. each adventure has a series of objectives. during an adventure, the current objective is displayed beneath the threat bar. after completing 1 objective, the app provides a new objective automatically. if the heroes complete the final objective before the threat bar is full, they win the adventure. if a hero is defeated, the remaining heroes continue playing; but if they do not complete the final objective by the start of the next shadow phase, they lose the adventure. tests to perform a test, reveal a number of cards from the top of your skill deck equal to the value of your tested stat (agility , might , spirit , wisdom , or wit ). then determine the number of successes . each success icon on the upper-left corner of revealed cards is 1 success. ignore the card text during tests. you use successes differently depending on the test: some tests require the hero to input the number of successes into the app by selecting the + button, then the app provides the outcome of the test. the successes for some of these tests are cumulative; the heroes can perform the test multiple times, and the app tracks the total number of successes. some tests provide a number that indicates how many successes are required to pass. if the hero has successes equal to or greater than the required number, they pass the test. otherwise, they fail the test. in either situation, the app provides the hero with further instructions. after completing the test, places all the cards you revealed during the test into your skill deck discard pile. fate and inspiration during a test, your revealed cards may contain fate icons . these have no inherent effect; but the hero can spend inspiration tokens (return them to the supply) to convert fate icons to success icons . each inspiration spent converts 1 fate icon. when you gain an inspiration, take an inspiration token from the supply and place it on your hero card. you cannot have more inspiration tokens than the inspiration limit on your hero card. attack tests to perform an attack test, choose any number of your equipped items to use for the attack, then choose a stat in the upper-left corner to test from those items. if you choose multiple items, all the items must have at least 1 stat in common, and the chosen stat must match an icon that is on all of the items that you chose. then, spend successes to resolve one or more of that item’s abilities. each ability indicates how many successes must be spent to resolve it, and each ability can be resolved only once per attack. most abilities add hits to enemies: select the enemy’s portrait, then the attack tab, then select the + button in the attack pane to input each hit. abilities may also provide attack modifiers: select the matching modifier(s) in the app: pierce: hits ignore an enemy group’s armor. smite: hits ignore an enemy group’s sorcery.cleave: hits are applied to all enemies in an enemy group. lethal: if an enemy’s remaining health (not armor or sorcery) is halved during an attack, that enemy is defeated. sunder: permanently decreases an enemy’s armor by 1. if an enemy is defeated, the armor of another enemy in the group is also reduced by 1. stun: the enemy group is exhausted, and if the enemy group is elite, it cannot counterattack. after inputting all hits and modifiers, select the apply button to apply the hits to the enemies (even if you had no hits). the enemy menu displays a health value for each figure in the enemy group as well as their armor or sorcery value. hits reduce armor or sorcery values first. if an enemy’s health is reduced to 0, it is defeated and removed from the board. if an enemy is not defeated, it regains all of its armor and sorcery, and it may counterattack. the enemy group can attack if it is in the hero’s space or in an adjacent space and has the ranged icon . if it can attack, select the yes button and resolve an attack. dual-wielding a hero can attack with more than 1 item if they all share the stat that is being tested. spend successes to resolve abilities on any of the chosen items. if you are attacking an adjacent enemy group, all of the chosen items must have the ranged icon . damage and fear when you suffer damage or fear , reveal a damage or fear card from the appropriate deck and place it faceup in your play area. then, resolve the card’s effect. if you are instructed to keep it faceup, it has a persistent effect. if you suffer multiple damage or fear at the same time, reveal each card one at a time, resolving each completely before revealing another. if you are specifically instructed to suffer facedown damage or fear, place that damage or fear facedown next to your hero card without reading the card’s text. you cannot look at the text of a facedown damage or fear card in your play area unless a game effect specifically allows it.if you are granted a chance to negate damage or fear before you suffer it, test the indicated stat: each success icon produced prevents 1 damage or fear (if you choose to do so). if you need to flip damage/fear cards faceup, select them at random from among your facedown damage/fear cards. if you need to discard a damage or fear card, you may discard (to the bottom of the appropriate deck) a faceup card of your choice or a random facedown card. last stands after a hero has suffered damage or fear, if they have a number of damage (faceup or facedown) equal to or greater than their damage limit or a number of fear (faceup or facedown) equal to or greater than their fear limit, that hero must perform a last stand. select the party button in the lower-left corner of the app. then select the hero’s portrait and the limit (damage or fear) that was reached, and follow the instructions. if you reach both of their limits, perform 2 last stands in the order of your choice. if you fail the last stand test, you are defeated. remove your figure from the board; the party loses the adventure at the beginning of the next shadow phase unless they complete the final objective. enemies readied and exhausted an enemy group is either readied or exhausted. enemies become exhausted (darkened portrait) either after the app activates them or after they attack. exhausted enemies cannot activate, counterattack, or be provoked. the app readies all enemy groups at the end of the shadow phase. provoking enemies while you are in the same space as a readied enemy group, these actions will provoke that enemy: • before you move out of a space with a readied enemy • before you interact with a token in a space with a readied enemy to provoke an enemy, select the provoke button to the left of the enemy portraits in the app, then select the portrait of the enemy. that enemy immediately resolves an enemy attack against the hero as instructed by the app. after the enemy attacks, you can continue your action. an enemy group is not exhausted when it is provoked. interrupting enemy activations some abilities can interrupt an enemy’s activation to apply hits or modifiers. select the enemy’s portrait, input and apply hits or modifiers indicated by the ability, then continue the enemy’s activation.placing enemies when an enemy group must be placed on the map, the app indicates where the group is placed and how many figures are in the group. when an enemy group is placed, the app adds that enemy group’s portrait to the enemy bar along the bottom of the screen. there should be 1 enemy group (containing 1 or more figures) on the map for each enemy portrait shown in the app. elite enemies an elite enemy group’s portrait has a spiked frame and banner icon. when placed on the map, place the elite banner token (red background) that matches that enemy group’s banner icon along with the enemy figures. an elite enemy group’s bonuses are listed in its enemy menu. the app automatically applies all enemy bonuses, but the heroes can select bonuses in the enemy menu to view their effects. all elite enemies are also able to counterattack even when exhausted. duplicate enemy groups there may be multiple enemy groups of the same type that are not elite. when this happens, each additional enemy group is assigned an enemy banner, presented next to that enemy’s portrait in the app. when you place that enemy group on the board, place the matching enemy banner token next to that group’s figures. cards abilities abilities that apply hits and modifiers to enemies are not attacks. to resolve these abilities, input hits and modifiers in the enemy’s menu and select apply, but always selects no if the app prompts a counterattack. you can only resolve an ability on a skill card while that skill card is prepared. if the card is not prepared (even when it is revealed during a test), ignore its ability text.when a card has multiple abilities, only one can be used unless stated otherwise. title cards title card abilities can usually be used only once during an adventure. when you gain a title card, take it and prepare it immediately. weakness cards if you gain a weakness card, place the top card of the weakness deck in your skill deck discard pile. you can prepare a weakness card to temporarily remove it from your skill deck even though it does not grant any abilities. resetting the skill deck you must reset your skill card deck during the rally phase; when there are no cards remaining in your deck; and when an effect instructs you to do so. reset your deck by shuffling your discard pile with any remaining cards in your deck and place the newly shuffled deck facedown. do not shuffle prepared cards into the deck.boons if you gain a boon, take a boon card of the appropriate type. you can only have 1 copy of each type. trinkets trinkets are item cards with the trinket icon . when you gain a trinket, search the unused item cards for the specified card and place it faceup next to your other items. then place a number of depletion tokens on the trinket equal to the number in the lower-left corner. if you are instructed to deplete a trinket, you must spend 1 depletion token by removing it from that trinket’s card. after the last depletion token is spent, the trinket is flipped facedown and cannot be used again during that adventure. during setup before each adventure, each hero can equip 1 trinket from among all the trinkets that the heroes have gained. after each adventure, return all equipped trinkets to the party’s inventory. trinkets receive their starting number of tokens at the beginning of each adventure. item cards abilities prefaced by a numeral and can only be used by spending during an attack test. items that can be used during an attack test contain 1 or more stats in the card’s upper-left corner. a hero can equip up to 1 armor card, a number of item cards that have a total of 2 or fewer hand icons (2 items or 1 item), and 1 trinket . you may equip more trinkets if you gain them during an adventure. the lore value in the lower-right corner indicates how much lore the party must gain before an upgrade for that item becomes available; you always upgrade to a card of the next higher tier (the roman numeral). roles a hero can select a different role for each adventure. when you select a new role, remove the role-specific cards numbered 1-3 that correspond to the previous role from your skill deck. keep those numbered 4 or more. any skill cards you purchased remain part of your skill deck if you select a new role. when you gain experience at the end of an adventure, it is always specific to the role you chose for that adventure. you can only spend experience from a role to purchase a skill card that matches that role. when you sell a skill card, you gain experience for the role that corresponds to the skill card that was sold. other rules nearby a component is nearby another component if they share the same space or are in spaces that are adjacent to each other. a nearby space refers to that space and all spaces adjacent to it. a component is not nearby itself."

the detective players and take the matching policeman pawns and reference sheet. jack also takes his reference sheet. jack takes a move track sheet and places it behind his screen, along with a pencil. he places a black jack pawn on the first night space of the board’s night track. jack secretly chooses his hideout, writing its number on his move track sheet in the top oval. the hideout may be any numbered circle on the board except a red numbered circle. jack takes the 5 red crime scene markers, the 19 yellow clue markers, the 8 white woman tokens, the 3 coach and 2 alley special movement tokens, and the red time of the crime token. one of the detectives shuffles the 5 head of the investigation (‘the boss’) tiles and places them facedown on the space in the bottom left corner of the board. the detectives take the 5 white wretched pawns and the 7 black police patrol tokens. nights the game is divided into 4 nights: 1. first night (august 31st, 1888) 2. second night (september 8th, 1888) 3. third night (september 30th, 1888): 2 murders 4. fourth night (november 9th, 1888) each night is divided into 2 parts made up of phases. each phase names either jack the ripper or the police as responsible for carrying out its instructions. first p art: hell  jack the ripper: preparing the scene jack collects special movement tokens (coach and alley): # night special movement tokens 1 aug 31st, 1888 3 coach and 2 alley tokens 2 sep 8th, 1888 2 coach and 2 alley tokens 3 sep 30th, 1888 2 coach and 1 alley token 4 nov 9th, 1888 1 coach and 1 alley token  jack the

7 women (4 marked) 3 sep 30th, 1888 6 women (3 marked) 4 nov 9th, 1888 4 women (1 marked) jack places the woman tokens facedown on any red numbered circles. the red-marked woman tokens are jack the ripper’s possible targets. the white-only tokens are fake targets. keep the red-marked faces hidden when they are placed: only jack knows which are the actual targets.on the 2nd and subsequent nights of the game, jack cannot place woman tokens on the red numbered circles occupied by red crime scene markers.  police: patrolling the streets the detectives turn over the top tile of the head of the investigation pile. the player controlling the policeman of the corresponding color is the head of the investigation for the current night. on the first night, he places the 7 police patrol tokens facedown on any of the yellow-bordered crossings (small black squares). 5 tokens have faces marked with the colors of the policeman pawns. the 2 black tokens are fake patrols. keep the marked faces hidden when they are placed: only the head of the investigation knows the actual positions of the policemen. from the 2nd night on, the head of the investigation places the tokens according to the following restrictions: – 5 tokens must be placed on the positions occupied by the policeman pawns at the end of the previous night. the tokens do not need to match the colors of the pawns that previously occupied the positions, and they can be fake patrols. – 2 tokens must be placed on yellow-bordered crossings that were not occupied by policeman pawns at the end of the previous night.  jack the ripper: the victims are chosen turn all of the woman tokens faceup. replace those marked with red with wretched pawns. remove the unmarked tokens from the board. place the time of the crime token on the yellow roman numeral i on the move track.  jack the ripper: blood on the streets jack must decide whether to kill a target or wait. if the time of the crime token is on the roman numeral v, jack must choose to kill a target. if jack decides to kill, he replaces one of the wretched pawns on the board with a crime scene marker. return the wretched pawn and 1 red-marked woman token to the box. on the 3rd night, september 30th, there are 2 murders. the night then continues with phase 8. if jack decides to wait, proceed with phase 6.  police: suspense grows move the time of the crime token to the next yellow roman numeral in ascending order. the head of the investigation then moves each of the wretched pawns on the board. each must move along dotted lines to an adjacent, unoccupied numbered circle. a wretched pawn cannot: – end its movement adjacent to a police patrol token; – cross a police patrol token during the wretched’s movement; – end its movement in a circle containing a crime scene marker. if a wretched has no legal moves it remains in its current circle. jack the ripper: ready to kill jack chooses a police patrol token and reveals it. if it is a fake patrol (black face), it is removed from the board. otherwise, it remains on the board, faceup. the game continues with another iteration of phase 5.  jack the ripper: a corpse on the sidewalk jack records on his sheet, in the space corresponding to the roman numeral currently marked by the time of the crime token and on the row corresponding to the current night, the number from the numbered circle marked by the crime scene token he just placed. jack is now located at that numbered circle. for the rest of the night he will be moving between circles, trying to get back to his hideout without being caught. jack places the second jack pawn on the board’s move track, on the space marked by the time of the crime token. that pawn is used to keep track of jack’s moves while he tries to escape.  police: alarm whistles the detectives reveal all the police patrol tokens that have not yet been revealed. replace the color-marked tokens with the corresponding policeman pawns and remove the fake tokens from the board. remove from the board any wretched pawns still in play. second p art: hunting  jack the ripper: escape in the night jack moves from his current numbered circle to an adjacent numbered circle along the dotted lines. he may not move over a crossing occupied by a policeman pawn. jack plots his move secretly, noting his destination circle on his sheet in the next available space to the right of his current location, in the row representing the current night. once his destination has been secretly noted, jack moves his jack pawn 1 space rightward on the board’s move track. his pawn’s location should always correspond on the track to the roman or arabic numeral of the move he just made. jack cannot choose a destination that would force him to move over a crossing occupied by a policeman pawn. if, for this reason, jack cannot make a legal move, he loses the game. if he wishes, jack can replace his normal movement with a special movement. to do so, he must expend a coach or alley token. if jack moves onto his hideout, he may declare that his escape was a success, and the current night’s hunt ends. if jack runs out of moves (ie, he fills in the 15 squares on his sheet) without reaching his hideout and declaring his escape, he loses the game.  police: hunting the monster after consulting together, the detectives move their policeman pawns. each player moves the pawn(s) whose policemen he controls, starting with the head of the investigation and going clockwise around the table. if a player controls multiple pawns, he chooses the order in which he moves them.when moving, a policeman pawn can move up to a distance of 2 (0, 1, or 2) crossings, along the dotted lines, ignoring numbered circles. when moving, a policeman pawn can move over other policeman pawns, but cannot end its move on the same crossing as another policeman pawn.  police: clues and suspicion starting with the head of the investigation and going clockwise around the table, each detective states, for each policeman pawn he controls, if that policeman is looking for clues or executing an arrest. each policeman pawn can execute only one of these actions (if a player controls several policeman pawns, he can choose a different action for each one). both actions can only be undertaken in the numbered circles adjacent to that policeman pawn (those directly connected by dotted lines to the crossing where the policeman is located). looking for clues to look for clues, the detective announces the number of an adjacent numbered circle. jack checks to see if that number appears anywhere on his sheet in the current night’s row. if it does, he places a clue marker on that numbered circle, and that policeman’s action ends. if it does not appear, the detective announces the number of another adjacent numbered circle. this process repeats until either a clue marker is placed or there are no more adjacent numbered circles. executing an arrest to execute an arrest, the detective announces the number of one adjacent numbered circle. if that number is jack’s current location (the most recent number jack recorded on his sheet), jack is arrested and loses the game. if the number is not jack’s current location, that policeman’s action ends. if jack has not been caught or reached his hideout after all policemen have taken actions, play proceeds with another iteration of hunting phase 1. the end of the hunting if jack is on the numbered circle he chose as his hideout, he may declare his escape, and the hunting (and that night) ends. remove all clue markers from the board. leave the policeman pawns and crime scene markers in place. remove the special movement tokens and the jack pawn from the move track. if the false clue rules are being used, discard any unused false clue markers. jack moves his pawn to the next night on the night track. the next night then begins with hell phase 1. special movements instead of carrying out a normal movement, jack can decide to use one of his special movement tokens. when used, a special movement token is placed on the space(s) of the move track corresponding to the turn that move was made. that token cannot be used again that night. if jack uses a special movement token, he must apply its effects. jack cannot declare his escape if he just used a special movement to move onto his hideout; the last move that takes jack into his hideout must be a normal move.coach jack can use a coach to move to 2 adjacent numbered circles in succession on the board at once (like a double move). he can also move through crossings containing policeman pawns. the 2 numbered circles involved in a coach move must be different from each other and from the circle he started the move from. both of the circles he moved to must be recorded in separate spaces on jack’s sheet in the proper order. jack’s pawn on the move track is moved twice, and the coach token is placed so it covers both of those spaces on the track. alley jack can use an alley to cross a block of houses, moving from a numbered circle on that block’s perimeter to any other numbered circle on that perimeter. a block of houses is an area of the game board that’s completely bounded, but not interrupted, by dotted lines. when jack uses an alley, he places that token on the corresponding space of the move track. 3rd night: the double event on the third night, september 30th, jack must kill 2 of the wretched. normal rules are followed with the exception that during hell phase 5, jack chooses 2 wretched pawns and replaces each one with a crime scene marker. then he notes the number of those 2 numbered circles on his sheet in 2 consecutive cells: the one indicated by the time of the crime token and the one to its right. he may record them in either order. because the second crime scene of the third night counts as jack’s first move that night, the detectives act first, with play starting from hunting phase 2. the hunting then proceeds as normal. jack starts his escape from the location corresponding to the second (rightmost) number he recorded. jack places his jack pawn on the space to the right of the time of the crime token on the move track, as jack’s ‘movement’ from the first crime scene to the second uses up his first move of the night. the detectives know both crime scenes, but not their order, so they cannot be sure exactly where jack is at the beginning of the third night’s hunting. end of the game jack wins the game if he kills 5 victims without being caught, returning to his hideout at the end of all 4 nights. the detectives win the game if they catch jack, or prevent him from reaching his hideout within the permitted number of moves. optional rules: jack jack’s letters during setup, jack takes the jack’s letter sheets. on each of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th nights, jack can use 1 letter to change the position of the police patrols. a letter can only be used after the police patrol tokens have been placed. once a letter is used and its effect applied, that letter is removed from the game. another letter cannot be used until the next night. the dear boss, saucy jack, and from hell letters are played during hell phase 3: dear boss jack moves a police patrol token (without looking at whether it is marked) from the a/a or c/b section of the board to any unoccupied yellow-bordered crossing. saucy jacky jack chooses 2 police patrol tokens from the b/a or b/b sections of the board. the head of the investigation moves both of them to any other unoccupied yellow-bordered crossings. from hell jack moves a police patrol token (without looking at whether it is marked) from the a/b or c/a section of the board to any unoccupied yellow-bordered crossing. the goulston street letter is played during the hunting, immediately after jack has moved in phase 1, but before any of the policemen move in phase 2. goulston street jack chooses either the red, green, or blue policeman pawns. then, the head of the investigation selects either the chosen pawn (the metropolitan police) or the brown pawn (the city of london police) and must immediately move that pawn to goulston street (the red-bordered crossing at a5/b8). false clues during setup, jack takes the 3 blue false clue markers. for every 5 yellow clue markers he reveals to the police during a given night, jack gains a blue false clue marker. jack can place one of these false clue markers on any numbered circle at the beginning of hunting phase 3. a false clue token blocks that numbered circle for the rest of the night: a policeman pawn cannot look for clues or execute an arrest there. optional rules: police rushing during hunting phase 3, each detective, starting with the head of the investigation and going clockwise, has a third option to choose from for his action: rushing. to rush, choose a policeman pawn that can still act and move it to an adjacent crossing (ignoring numbered circles). area arrests during hunting phase 3, when executing an arrest, the detective announces all of the numbered circles adjacent to his policeman pawn’s location. if any of these numbered circles correspond to jack’s current location, jack is arrested and loses the game. otherwise, no information is given. catch me, if y ou can during setup, when jack secretly chooses one of the numbered circles on the board as his hideout, he cannot choose red numbered circles or numbered circles adjacent to them. i know y our address during hell phase 3, if the revealed head of the investigation tile is swanson (brown) or abberline (red), the head of the investigation detective can immediately execute an arrest, declaring the number of any circle on the board. if that numbered circle was choosen by jack as his hideout, the detectives win the game. this ability can be used only once during the game."
112,222509,LORDS OF HELLAS,2018,AWAKEN REALMS,3.3348,221,"setup set up the board. place the first level of each monument in the game in its region with its matching god’s artifact card underneath it. shuffle the events deck (monster and quest cards), monster attack deck, and combat deck, and place each on their space on the board. set aside the artifact cards assigned to their matching monsters. shuffle the remaining neutral artifact cards and place the deck on its space on the board.shuffle the blessing cards from the gods whose monuments are in the game into 1 deck and place it on the map. place the monster die, monster wound markers, glory tokens, quest tokens, monster miniatures, monument parts, monument cards and monster trays near the board. choose 1 random temple card and put it on its space on the board. place temples and the oracle of delphi on this temple card (only the first 6 temples for 3 and 2 player games). draw 7 cards from the events deck and resolve them: 1. place quest cards in the quest slots and place the quest token for each drawn quest in its matching region. once the third quest card has been placed in the slot, ignore subsequent quest cards drawn during setup (they still count toward the 7 cards drawn). 2. after drawing a monster card, place its miniature in the region indicated, and place the monster tray (along with the artifact assigned to it) next to the board. if the drawn monster card shows a monster which is already on the board, ignore this card and draw another card instead. 3. shuffle all the event cards used during setup back into the events deck (not including quests on the quest tray). every player draws a combat card (these are kept secret, but the number of cards in a player’s hand is not) and a help tray (these describe the god powers). decide upon a starting player. this player chooses a hero, takes the corresponding hero board, chooses an armies board, and takes all components of that color (hoplites, priest, control tokens, and colored ring). place the plastic colored ring on your hero’s base, take 6 used action tokens, then place 3 attribute tokens on the leadership, strength and speed attributes at value 1. resolve the chosen hero’s starting bonus. then place the hero miniature, along with 2 hoplites, in any region. if the population strength in that region is 2 or less, place your control token there. moving counter-clockwise, the next player chooses one of the remaining heroes and armies and places them on the board following the same process. you cannot place your hero and hoplites in a region which already contains another hero. the last player to choose and place their hero on the board begins the game. map regions are the smallest named area on the map, marked with a population strength that determines the number of hoplites a player needs to take control of the region (use control tokens to mark which player controls a region). lands consist of 3 or 4 regions of the same color.cities give you a +1 fortification bonus and allow you to recruit 2 hoplites. sparta is a special city in laconia which gives you a +2 fortification bonus, and allows you to recruit 4 hoplites. shrines mark where temples can be built. the oracle of delphi can only be built in phocis. temple cards define which temples will trigger the blessing draft. a temple card also defines the special reward for building the oracle of delphi. sea trails connect regions by sea. regions connected with sea trails act as if they are adjacent to each other. by controlling regions with monuments, your hero gains its god’s artifact. there is also 1 free place for a monument, used in expansions. heroes and armies there are 4 heroes and armies: helen, achilles, heracles and perseus. each hero has a different starting bonus and special ability. armies are identical for rules purposes. put your hero and player boards together to form 1 board. a hero has 3 attributes. leadership determines the number of hoplites a player can move each turn during the hoplite movement regular action. strength determines how many combat cards a player draws at the beginning of a hunt. speed determines the number of regions a hero can traverse during the hero movement regular action. once raised, an attribute cannot be lowered unless a special instruction specifies otherwise. when you receive a priest, place him in your priest pool. only priests placed there are counted as player property. game sequence players take turns in clockwise order. on your turn, use your regular actions, then you must end your turn with a special action. regular actions regular actions may be performed in any order, but you can perform a given regular action only once. you may use any number of your artifacts during your turn if they are charged. turn a used artifact card sideways. artifacts are charged (turned right way up) whenever any player performs a build monument special action. once per turn, you can send a priest from your priest pool (you start without any priests) to any monument. after placing the priest, immediately raise the related hero attribute by 1 and use the monument power corresponding to its level. the hero attribute increase is permanent. a priest can take any free spot on a monument and remains there until any of the players performs a build monument special action. if there are no free spots on a monument, a player cannot place a priest on it. movement you can move your hero through a number of regions equal to their speed attribute, or over 1 quest step (if your hero is on a quest). heroes can move and stop in any region without regard to the presence of hoplites, other heroes, or monsters. they cannot make any actions in regions they are passing through; they can do so only before or after a whole move. if a hero ends their movement in a region with a quest token in it, they can immediately move to the quest step assigned to that quest if they meet the requirements described by its quest card. after entering a quest, a player can move only 1 quest step, regardless of their speed attribute. hoplite movement you can move a maximum number of hoplites to a neighboring region equal to your leadership attribute. hoplites move from a region to any other neighboring region. no hoplite can move twice. you can, during your move, fortify a hoplite in each region you control which contains a city or sparta. treat that city as another region for movement, but they normally take part in battle. fortified hoplites receive a bonus to army strength if they fight in the region (+1 for a city, or +2 for sparta). moving hoplites out of a city or sparta into the region with that city or sparta is treated as movement. fortified hoplites always die last. moving hoplites into a region with enemy hoplites results in a battle. moving hoplites into a region controlled by an enemy, but without hoplites, allows you to take control of that region. this is not a battle. you can take over the region without meeting population strength (even with just 1 hoplite). first make all your moves with your hoplites and then fight any ensuing battles. the attacking player decides on the order of battles. if any special rule enables you to move your hoplites by more than 1 region, you can only travel through neutral regions or those under your control. you can end the movement in a region controlled by an enemy. during that movement, you do not take control over regions you are moving through. special actions mark a used special action with a used action token. that action then remains unavailable until the token is removed. recruit recruit up to 2 hoplites in every region you control with a city in it (or up to 4 hoplites in sparta). if there is room in the city or sparta, one of the recruited hoplites may be recruited already fortified. you can have a maximum of 15 hoplites. when you have none left you cannot put more on the map in any way. you cannot remove hoplites from the map to relocate them. march move any number of your hoplites from 1 region to a single neighboring region. fortified hoplites cannot be relocated with this action. you can move hoplites who were previously moved in a regular action or as a result of abilities or monuments. the same rules used when moving hoplites as a regular action apply.build temple build a temple in a region you control with a shrine. place a temple on the shrine slot and add 1 priest to your priest pool. if you build the oracle of delphi, receive the additional rewards listed on the temple card. if, under the temple slot, there is a red frame with the draft keyword, start a blessing draft. you can have a maximum of 4 priests. if you have 4 in your priest pool or at monuments, you cannot receive more. prepare choose any 2 of these options (one can be chosen twice): heal a single injury on your hero. draw a combat card. recruit 1 hoplite in the region where your hero is present. you cannot perform this action if your hero is outside the map (on a quest, or in a region also occupied by another player’s hoplites). however, you can do so in an empty region controlled by an enemy, and thus take control of it. usurp if you possess a glory token matching the color of the region where your hero is located, you can instantly take control over that region and can recruit 1 hoplite in it (which may be recruited already fortified in a city or sparta). you do not lose the glory token. all enemy hoplites must withdraw from the region, but suffer no losses. hunt begin a hunt for a monster in the same region as your hero. build monument build a level of a monument. choose the monument you want to build and add the appropriate piece to it. return all priests from all monuments to their controlling player’s resources (not to the priest pool). the player using this special action receives as many priests as the number of temples they control (the oracle of delphi counts as a temple). building monuments marks the end of a round. all players remove their used action tokens and charge their artifacts (turn them right way up). proceed with the monster phase. the build monument special action can be used by a player even if other special actions have not yet been used. if the 5th level of a monument is built, trigger a monument activation card. monster phase the player who performed the build monument special action rolls the monster die for every monster on the map (in an order of their choice): nothing: nothing happens. move on to the next monster. action: the monster performs a region attack as described on its monster tray. move: the player who performed the build monument special action must move the monster to adjacent region of their choice. move or action: the player who performed the build monument special action decides whether the monster performs an action or moves. any additional decision required is made by the active player. event phase the player who performed the build monument special action draws the top card from the events deck and immediately resolves it. there are 2 types of cards: quest: if there is space on the quest track, place the appropriate quest token in the region indicated and place the quest event card in the free slot on the quest track. if there are already 3 quests on the quest track, place this card on the discard pile without any effect. monster: the effect of the card depends if the monster is already on the map or slain: if the monster is already on the map, it evolves. place the card next to its monster tray. the evolve effect lasts until the end of the game (or until the monster is slain). if the monster is not on the map, place its miniature in the region indicated on the drawn card. place its monster tray and the artifact assigned to it next to the map. if the monster has been slain, discard this card without effect, and draw another. after the event phase, the next player begins their player turn. monsters monsters appear on the map as the result of events. the number of wounds they have indicates their monster power. monsters can evolve (if they are already present on the board and their event card is drawn again), increasing their number of wounds or gaining additional rules. wound symbols determine which combat cards a hero must employ to kill a monster. those with the symbol of a priest ( ) or artifact ( ) on them grant additional rewards, even after an unsuccessful hunt. to inflict a wound on a monster, discard a combat card with a wound symbol corresponding to one on the monster tray, then place a wound marker in the appropriate spot. some cards enable any type of wound marker to be placed on a monster. the special attack is the monster’s attack when the special attack monster card is drawn. the region attack is the effect when an action result is rolled on the monster die (there might also be a passive ability that works in the monster’s region). hunt a hero must be in the same region as the target monster to begin a hunt. combat begins when you use the hunt special action. choose 1 of the monsters in the same region as your hero (there may be more than 1 monster present) and then draw as many combat cards as the level of your hero’s strength attribute. follow these steps: 1. hero attacks monster the hero must inflict at least 1 wound on the monster. if you fail to do so, hunt ends immediately. you can inflict multiple wounds at the same time, and even slay the monster on the first turn if you have the appropriate combat cards. 2. monster attacks hero the player to the left of the player fighting the monster draws 2 cards from the monster attack deck and chooses 1 of them. the hunter can: a. defend: play any number of combat cards with a total value equal to or higher than the strength of the monster’s attack to defend yourself from the attack. then, draw 2 combat cards. b. not defend: resolve the monster attack card effects (receive injuries, end hunt etc.), then draw 1 combat card. repeat the hunt sequence until the hunt ends: a. successfully: a monster receives a final wound; or b. unsuccessfully: you are unable to inflict any wounds on the monster during your attack; or a card was played during the monster’s attack which causes an end to the hunt; or you failed to defend yourself from the attack; or the hero receives a fourth injury. after an unsuccessful hunt your hero receives 1 additional injury (if possible). all wounds inflicted on monsters remain. to mark an injury on a hero, flip a chosen attribute token; that attribute has a value of 1 until the hero heals that injury. a hero can receive 3 injuries during a hunt (each aimed at 1 of their attributes). if the hero receives a fourth injury, the hunt ends. injuries may be healed by performing a prepare special action or using artifacts. hunt rewards whenever you unsuccessfully end a hunt, you still get to pick 1 reward from wounds that you have inflicted with an priest ( ) or artifact ( ) symbol on them. however, if a hunt against a monster is successful, and you manage to deal the last wound, you: • receive a glory token in the color of the region in which the hunt took place. if the token belongs to another player, taken it from them. • choose 1 reward from an artifact linked to this monster or priest/neutral artifacts from wounds the player inflicted (only during this hunt). • place the monster miniature near your hero board. if you have 3 monster miniatures, you win the game. if you deal a wound to a monster without hunting it (with a blessing or artifact), you do not receive any rewards. however, if you slay the monster this way (by dealing the last wound), you receive a glory token and the monster is placed next to your hero board and counts toward victory. battles if hoplite movement results in the hoplites of 2 players meeting in the same region, a battle ensues, with all hoplites in the region taking part. if the movement causes the start of more than 1 battle, the active player decides in which order they are fought. follow this sequence: 1. play combat cards the defender can play 1 combat card from their hand. if they do, resolve that card’s effect and add its strength to their army strength. if they pass, they cannot play more combat cards during the current battle. the attacking player can play 1 combat card in the same way. if they pass, they also cannot play any more cards. repeat this sequence until both players pass. playing some of the most powerful cards causes you to kill your own troops after the battle. these cards have red casualty symbols marking how many hoplites need to be killed. you cannot play combat cards with a total number of casualty symbols exceeding the number of your hoplites in a battle.no player can have more than 4 combat cards in hand during the game. you may draw additional cards, but must then immediately discard cards down to 4. this limit does not apply during a hunt, but once a hunt is over, you must immediately reduce the number of combat cards you hold to 4. 2. compare army strength players compare army strengths. every hoplite is worth 1 army strength point. a combat card’s card power determines how much the card adds to army strength during battle, or the defense value during a hunt. add the value of combat cards played, plus any bonuses resulting from fortification of the defenders, blessings, artifacts, or special skills of the hero. the player with the highest army strength wins. if players have equal army strengths, the defending player wins. 3. casualties and withdraw players (losers and winners alike) kill as many hoplites among those who participated in the battle as there were casualties symbols on the combat cards they played. the losses from combat cards result from the combat cards you played and not those your opponent played. the loser of the battle kills an additional hoplite and has to withdraw their remaining hoplites to a neighboring region of their choice. you cannot withdraw to a region controlled by another player or a region in which another player’s hoplites are present. if you are unable to withdraw your units, all of them are killed. if the attacker loses the battle, they must withdraw to the region from which they attacked. in any event, hoplites that are fortified are always killed last. 4. control the winner of the battle takes control from the owner of the region in which the battle was fought. if the attacker sustains losses to the extent that they have no hoplites remaining in the region, even though they won the battle, they cannot take control of the region. quests to start a quest, you must finish your hero movement in a region with a quest token and meet the requirements for starting the quest from any step. during your next turn, instead of a hero movement, you can move the hero along the quest steps by 1 position (hero speed is not relevant). as soon as you place the hero on the quest card, you no longer need to meet the requirements of subsequent quest steps. even if you are already on a quest, an enemy player can start the quest from a higher step and finish the quest before you. when you move a hero to the final step of a quest track, the quest is completed (therefore, if you meet the requirements of the third quest step, you can finish the quest immediately). place your hero on the map in the region containing the quest token; the hero cannot move this turn. receive the reward written on the quest card for completing the quest and take a glory token in the color of the region where you undertook the quest. remove the quest token from the map. once you embark upon a quest, you cannot abandon it.artifacts artifacts let you use the special skill described on the card. after being used, an artifact cannot be used again until it is charged during a build monument special action (by any player). once you obtain an artifact, you have it for the rest of the game. artifacts are visible to other players. god’s artifacts are artifacts obtained by controlling a region with a monument. they work just like normal artifacts, but once any other player takes control over a region with a monument for a given artifact, that player immediately takes the god’s artifact (charged for its new owner) associated with that region from its previous owner. blessing cards building a temple with the draft keyword and red frame triggers a draft of blessing cards: special enhancements in the form of passive bonuses for your hero and army. the player who built the temple which triggered the blessing draft draws an amount of blessing cards equal to the number of players +1, picks 1, and passes the rest of the cards to the player to the right (counter-clockwise). continue this process until all players have drawn a card from the draft, then discard the unused card. blessings cards are permanent and visible to other players. victory conditions the game ends immediately when a player meets one of these victory conditions: 1. warlord of hellas: control of 2 lands. in a 3 player game, controlling the blue land does not count toward this victory condition. in a 2 player game, you must control 3 lands. 2. favored of the gods: control 5 regions with temples. 3. monster slayer: slay 3 monsters.4. king of kings: this victory condition is activated once any monument is fully built. whoever controls a region with a fully built monument after 3 turns wins. in a 2 player game, ignore this victory condition. a player who builds the final part of a monument takes the monument activation card and places 3 of their used action tokens on it. from this point on, whenever they use a special action, they take the token from the monument activation card. when the last token is taken, the player who controls the region with the first fully built monument wins. two-player mode in a 2 player game, change the following: victory conditions warlord of hellas: you must take control of 3 lands, not 2. king of kings: ignore this victory condition. build monument special action before using the build monument special action, a player can choose 1 of the special actions already used (with a used action token on them) and use it before the build monument special action. if all

if you have agents available, you must assign one. if you have no more agents available to assign, you can no longer take turns during that round. for the rest of the round, play skips to the next player in order who still has available agents. if no one can legally assign an agent, the round ends. 2. complete quest after assigning an agent, you may complete one quest. each quest card specifies how many and what kind of adventurers (and/or gold) are needed to complete it. you don’t have to complete a quest, but you cannot complete more than one quest on your turn, regardless of how many agents you assign or reassign on your turn. remove the required adventurers and gold from the tavern on your player mat, return those tokens to the supply, then collect the specified reward.end of round when all agents at waterdeep harbor have been reassigned, the round ends. all players return all their agents to their pools. the player with the first player marker begins the next round. buildings the number of empty building spaces on the board is not a limit to the number of buildings that can be in play. you cannot control more buildings than you have building control markers. builder’s hall when you assign an agent to builder’s hall, choose one of the faceup buildings available for purchase and pay its gold cost. immediately score any vp for that building, place its tile in one of the open spots on the board and attach one of your control markers to it to show you are the owner, and follow its when purchased instructions. then draw the top tile of the building stack and place it faceup on the vacated space. owner benefit: once a new building is in play, anyone can assign an agent to it, but the owner gains the benefit described in the tile’s owner line (not when the owner uses their own building). cliffwatch inn cliffwatch inn has 3 action spaces; you can choose any of the available action spaces, and you can assign more than one of your agents to cliffwatch inn if it still has an open action space (but still only one agent per turn). whenever you take a faceup quest card, immediately replace it with a new card from the quest deck. waterdeep harbor waterdeep harbor has 3 action spaces; assign agents to available spaces in numerical order, starting with space 1. you can assign more than one of your agents here if it still has an open space (but still only one agent per turn). assigning an agent to one of the waterdeep harbor spaces has 2 effects: 1. play one intrigue card from your hand. if you have none, you cannot assign an agent to waterdeep harbor. follow the card’s instructions immediately; its effect takes place just once. 2. reassign agent. after all agents have been assigned in the round, each player with an agent in waterdeep harbor reassigns that agent to another action space (thus taking an additional turn with that agent). reassign agents in order, starting with the action space numbered 1. you cannot reassign an agent to waterdeep harbor.quest cards there are 5 different types of quests, and a quest’s type indicates what sort of adventurers are most important to completing it: arcana (wizard) commerce (any + gold) piety (cleric) skullduggery (rogue) warfare (fighter). each time you take a quest card, you must place it faceup with your other active quests. the ‘requires:’ line shows which resources are required to complete the quest. the ‘reward:’ line shows the reward that a completed quest provides to the player who completes it. adventurers and gold are taken from the supply and placed in your tavern. quests provide a reward once when completed; then turn the card facedown and place it on the completed quests area of your player mat. different lords of waterdeep score bonus vp for completing quests of particular types. mandatory quests when you play an intrigue card with a mandatory quest, choose an opponent and place the card faceup in front of him. they cannot complete any other quests until they have completed the mandatory quest. when a mandatory quest is completed, place the card in the intrigue discard pile. plot quests these have ongoing effects as well as rewards. when you complete a plot quest, place its card faceup near your player mat to remind you of the ongoing effect. ending the game at the end of the 8th round of play the game ends; perform final scoring for each player. final scoring each player counts up vp and advances their scoring marker (use the counters representing 100 vp when a score marker passes the ‘0’ space): each adventurer in your tavern: 1 vp. every 2 gold in your tavern (rounding down): 1 vp. lords of waterdeep card: as specified by the card. the player with the most vp after final scoring is the winner. on a tie, the player with the most gold wins."

otherwise it is blowing south. place the wind compass to indicate wind direction. the highest rolling player chooses to set up on the east or west sides, and begins by placing a single mow, ind or sol squadron. players alternate taking turns placing a single mow, ind or sol squadron within 9"" of their table edge and 9"" from the north and south edges. squadrons one ship from each squadron is nominated as the flagship; place a flagship counter on its template. if a flagship is sunk or cannot move, another ship may take over as flagship. all actions for each ship are performed individually. each ship moves, shoots and then performs any boarding action before moving on to the next ship in the squadron (or passing play to your opponent if you moved a mow or ind). once a player touches a ship they are committed to finishing its move. you cannot pass on a turn but may select a squadron and perform no actions with it. if a sol ever ends a turn more then 6"" from its flagship it becomes a straggler and subject to the rules for stragglers until it rejoins its squadron.turn sequence 1. initiative phase roll a d6 to determine who goes first. on a double the wind changes one position; clockwise for evens, counter-clockwise for odds. reroll to win initiative. house rule: on double 5s or 6s the wind changes 2 positions. 2. magic phase the starting player casts a spell and their opponent may attempt to dispel it, then vice-versa. 3. battle phase starting with the player with the initiative, players take turns moving and fighting with a single mow, ind or squadron of sol ships. 4. end phase record keeping, replenish magic cards, check for fires spreading and move stragglers. the rule of one 1 on a d6 roll always means failure despite modifiers. 6 on a d6 roll always means success when rolling for saves despite modifiers. magic roll the casting number or higher to successfully cast or dispel a spell. the spell colour a spell can dispel is shown on the bottom of the card. if a spell allows you to move an enemy ship you may not move it off the table. unless stated on the card, spells last for a single turn. spells are discarded once attempted or used. a wizard lord adds +1 to their roll when casting or dispelling a spell. once per turn, if they fail to cast or dispel a spell of their own college colour, they may reroll the dice. house rule: no spell may be cast on the first game turn. movement ship templates give the ship’s maximum speed in inches. speed can be affected by damage and the wind as noted. use the turning template when turning; each turn must use 2 inches of movement. movement under sail check the wind direction by placing the turning template against the ship. if a straight line from the wind to the ship’s bow passes through the template you are not sailing into the wind. some ships move faster with the wind astern. place the template so it is facing the stern and use the same procedure.once the direction of the wind is found the ship is considered to be at that angle to the wind for the whole of its turn. all ships under sail which turn to face the wind must finish moving immediately after the turn. a ship under sail that starts its movement against the wind may only make a single turn to face out of the wind. movement with oars ships using oars are not affected by the wind. they may turn 90º on the spot by expending half their move and 180º by expending all; and may row backwards up to 2” instead of a normal move. you may only move at ramming speed if you make no turns. ramming ships with oars and rams may ram . the ship must move at least 3"" in a straight line to the target. damage is inflicted immediately according to the ramming chart for that vessel, and then the ship may fire its cannons and initiate a boarding action. obstructions any ship moving over a sandbank, rocks, terrain etc ends movement, runs aground and must make a below the waterline saving throw. if failed the ship takes 1-3 points of below the waterline damage. if starting the battle phase aground, roll 4+ to move away or be stuck until the next turn’s attempt. collisions if a ship touches another, movement ends. a ram or boarding action may take place. if starting a turn in contact a ship may push clear at a cost of half movement, moving along the side of the other ship. any ship that sails off the table edge has left the battle and may not return. combat and damage choose your target and measure the range using the range template, with the centre mark touching the centre of the front or side of the firing ship. cannons are the standard weapons and have a range of 9"" and each can fire once per battle phase. a ship can be in close, medium, or long range. a shot hits the first obstacle that is under the range template. declare if you are aiming high or low if required (you cannot split cannons firing in the same direction) and roll a d6. the result indicates the hit location on the target’s template. the target can make a saving throw for each hit location, modified by the shooting weapon’s range (if applicable). other weaponry may have different specifics and requirements, but the general rule is that to check the range, roll the dice to determine location, conduct saves and then mark damage if necessary.damage if a location fails its save, place a damage marker and note the side effects if there are any. if an area containing cannons that can fire broadside is destroyed, the ship can no longer fire on both sides with those guns. critical hits if a destroyed area is hit again and fails its save, a critical hit occurs (unless otherwise indicated). roll on the critical hit table: 1 panic spreads through the ship as the enemy shots strike home inflicting terrible damage on men and equipment. the crew call upon the captain to guide them through the danger. make a roll on the captain’s chart. 2 the tar-saturated wood catches light and flames start to spread across the ship. replace the damage marker on this location with a blaze marker. test on the blaze spreading table in the end phase. 3 a great chunk of the ship is torn away, washing men and goods overboard. the ship loses 1 crew counter. if the ship is left without any crew counters, it is abandoned. 4 with an ominous creak, the seams of the boat start to split. the ship takes 1 below the waterline hit. 5 a great gash appears in the side of the ship as the sea floods the lower decks. the ship takes 2 below the waterline hits. 6 the hull gives way with a resounding crack. the ship takes 3 below the waterline his. if a ship’s crew strength is reduced to 0 the ship is abandoned. if a below the waterline hit is indicated the ship does not get a saving throw for that hit. if a fire is indicated replace the damage counter with a blaze counter; it may spread in the end phase. captain’s chart 1 the captain’s maps and charts are burnt to a crisp. the ship may not move this turn if it hsn’t already done so as the captain has to preplot its course. place a no movement counter next to the ship; remove the counter at the end of the turn. 2 the captain’s treasure chest is split open, spraying the deck with gold. the ship may not fire this turn as the crew are too busy picking up the fallen booty. place a no firing counter next to the ship; remove the counter at the end of the turn. 3 the captain is caught by a stray shot and killed outright. the ship may do nothing but defend itself until the end of the turn, when a new captain is elected. place a no movement and a no firing counter next to the ship; remove both counters at the end of the turn. 4 the captain is washed overboard by a freak wave. roll a dice. to pick the captain up: 1-2 ship must take a 2"" left turn. 3-4 ship must take a 2"" right turn. 5-6 ship must move straight ahead 2"".5 the captain’s secret rum stash is hit. the decks are awash with alcohol. roll a dice for each crew counter: on a 6 they are drunk and fall overboard. remove any drunk crew counters from the ship. 6 mutiny! roll a dice for each crew counter: on a 5 or 6 they take to the boats and abandon ship. remove the mutineers from the ship. effects of ramming the opposing player must make a saving throw against a below the waterline hit. if it fails the ship takes damage (see the attacking ship’s details). sinking once a ship’s below the waterline area is destroyed it sinks. place a sunk counter on the template and replace the ship with a wreckage marker. wreckage markers obstruct movement and line of sight like a ship. during the end phase replace it with a debris marker; this does not obstruct movement or line of sight. at the end of the next turn this is removed. any admiral or wizard who was on the ship may cling to wreckage or debris while it is there. boarding actions only 1 boarding action can be initiated per turn if a ship is in contact with 2 or more ships. both sides roll a dice and add the number of crew counters on their ship. the defender adds the number of remaining cannons he has pointing in the direction of the attacker. a ship with an admiral gets +1 to the boarding action roll. the player with the lowest total loses a crew counter. a winning attacker may press on or break off the attack. a winning defender may cut grapples and the boarding action ends. if he continues he is the attacker and can no longer add cannons to his roll, but then his opponent may if he has them. if totals are the same, both sides lose a crew and the defender decides whether to cut grapples. if all the crew are killed, any admiral or wizard on board is killed. a ship with no crew counters left has lost; place an abandoned marker on the ship’s template and an abandoned counter by the ship. any boarding action against the ship will succeed automatically. captured ships an winning player may transfer crew counters (up to the original ship limit) and take the ship as a prize, or scuttle the ship. a prize ship (place a captured marker on the ship’s template and a captured counter by the ship) cannot move or fire and if repelling boarders the crew cannot use the ship’s cannons. house rule: if a ship has been captured for at least 1 full turn it is worth double battle honours. ships are scuttled during the end phase. a recaptured ship may be recrewed but acts as a straggler this turn.end phase pick up survivors any ships in contact with wreckage or debris may rescue admirals or wizards clinging to it. wreckage and debris remove debris markers; any characters clinging to the debris are lost. change wreckage markers into debris. fires roll on the blaze spreading table for each area on fire on the ship: 1 blaze goes out; remove the blaze marker (bm) 2-3 blaze does not spread 4 blaze spreads forward; place another bm 5 blaze spreads upward; place another bm 6 blaze spreads backwards; place another bm if a fire goes out, replace it with a damage marker. if the fire spreads, place another fire marker left or right as appropriate. there is no saving throw. if there is a choice of areas roll a die. if there is no space nothing happens. if the area is already damaged it is simply set on fire; there is no critical hit. blazing locations are treated as destroyed locations. if there is a fire in a location that can take 2 hits and only one is ablaze, any result that says a fire spreads means the second part of the area is now ablaze too. stragglers stragglers cannot move or fire in the battle phase though they may defend as normal if boarded. in the end phase they may move but cannot fire or board. scuttle ships if the original boarding ship is no longer in contact the boarding crew are out of the game. replace the scuttled ship with a wreckage marker. remove counters remove any no movement or no firing counters placed as a result of critical hits or magic spells. pick up magic cards if your wizard is still alive and not clinging to wreckage, discard any magic cards not wanted and then replenish your hand to full strength. then, any spells played this turn with a duration of 1 turn are removed. victory if all of one side’s ships are sunk or captured the game ends; the other player is the winner. optionally, play to a time limit and count up battle honours: each player totals the number of below the waterline hits for all enemy ships they sunk or captured. any enemy ships scuttled or abandoned at the end of the game count as ships sunk. an admiral captured or killed is worth 5 battle honours. wizards are worth 1 for a wizard champion, 2 for a master wizard and 3 for a wizard lord."

event cards beginning with ‘play as an action’ can be played as an action during an action round. troubleshooting there are normal headlines and mastermind headlines. troubleshooting a normal headline 1. determine trouble level roll dice equal to the district’s threat number. dice boosting: if any dice show a boost icon, roll them again (ignore any more boost icons). if any of your heroes or supporting heroes in the district has a skill shown on the headline card, ignore all boost icons. the total of of hit and trouble icons is the trouble level and is recorded on the trouble track. 2. reduce trouble reduce the trouble level by the appropriate troubleshooting rating (crime, danger or mystery) of a ready hero in the district. if the level is at 0, go to headline resolution. 3. play villains all other players, beginning with the hero player’s nemesis and proceeding clockwise, take these steps: draw one villain card (in a 2-player game, draw 2). decide whether or not to play a villain card. as soon as one is played it is the lead villain and this step stops. the current trouble level must be equal or higher than the trouble level requirement on the card. reduce the trouble level by the villain’s trouble cost. if no one plays a card go to headline resolution. play backup effects and agents. the effects and trouble cost on the lower half of one or more villain cards are played (no trouble level requirement). most wanted villains each villain on a most wanted space is available to all players during the play villains step of a troubleshooting action, but can be played only as a lead villain. the trouble level requirement of a most wanted villain is 0, but the cost must be paid normally. 4. combat resolve combat using the combat rules. if the villain wins a defeated ready hero is placed in recovery with one wound token. heroes on support spaces stay where they are. discard the headline card. lead villain, backup effect and agent cards are discarded. lead villain cards with a most wanted icon which are placed on a most wanted space. if the spaces are full the player controlling the nemesis of the defeated team decides whether to replace a card or discard the villain. if the hero wins discard any ko tokens, discard the lead villain, backup effect and agent cards. 5. headline resolution if there was no lead villain or the hero defeats him, take the headline card and the number of victory points indicated. reset the trouble level to 0. troubleshooting a mastermind headline scheming the hero player’s nemesis can choose one of these scheming options: increase the threat the nemesis may add his threat (crime, danger or mystery) to the district’s threat. draw additional villain cards the nemesis may draw a number of additional villain cards equal to the highest level among the ready heroes in the district. boost combat the nemesis may give the lead villain dice boosting. attempting master plans at the start of a troubleshooting action involving a mastermind headline, the hero player’s nemesis may attempt a master plan. master plans must be attempted in order (prologue, development then conclusion). place the nemesis figure on the headline card and show the hero player which one of his master plans he is attempting. once all master plans are completed no more may be attempted, though scheming abilities may still be used. if the hero player wins a troubleshooting action he scores the headline normally, and must then choose if he wants to challenge the mastermind villain.any ko tokens are not discarded. start a new battle versus the mastermind, using his combat abilities and powers. mastermind villains may always use dice boosting. a number of villain cards equal to the henchmen rating of the mastermind are drawn from the villain deck and played as backup effects without cost. if the lead villain or mastermind wins (or the hero player chooses not to challenge) the mastermind completes his master plan and can from now on use the special ability of that master plan card. if the hero wins the hero may put one of his team power-up cards into play. the failed master plan card may be attempted again later (not in the current round). the archnemesis the archnemesis can take a scheming action and attempt a master plan when his opposing player is attempting to solve any headline. combat combat powers each character (hero or villain) has 1-3 combat powers (red, orange and yellow, each of which has 3 values (attack, defend and outwit) from 1-5, indicating how many dice you roll if you choose that power. combat special abilties are normally used by discarding a card (a resource card for heroes and a villain card for villains). any villain player may discard a villain card to use the ability of a lead villain, not just the player controlling it. support (combat) special abilties are used during combat. the hero must be in the support space of the area in which the teammate is engaged in combat. resolving combat the hero player and the player who played the lead villain both take 3 combat power tokens of different colors. the hero has first initiative. these steps are repeated until combat ends: 1. choose powers each player secretly chooses 1 combat power token and tokens are revealed simultaneously. 2. first attack phase if a hero has a team member in a support space of his area, he receives dice boosting. the character with initiative (the attacker) rolls dice equal to the attack rating of his chosen power (if it is 0, skip this step) and may use special abilities. then his opponent (the defender) rolls dice equal to the defend rating of his chosen power and may use special abilities. if the defender’s defend is 0, the attacker will score a ko unless the attacker doesn’t roll any hits. count hit icons rolled. if the attacker’s number of hits are equal to or greater than the defender’s, he scores 1 ko. if the defender now has a number of kos equal to his ko value, he is defeated.3. second attack phase as above with swapped roles. 4. outwit contest the character with initiative rolls dice equal to the outwit rating of his chosen power. the player that rolls more hits scores a ko on the other and gains inititaive for the next combat sequence. on a draw, no kos are inflicted, the player who currently has initiative keeps it, and another combat sequence is fought. allies, backup effects & agents to activate an ally’s ability, discard 1 pp token on the ally card or discard the card itself if it has no tokens. to activate a backup effect’s ability, discard the card. agents abilities are in use throughout the combat; the cards are only discarded once the combat has ended. special abilities abilities may not be used multiple times to affect the same roll or value. if an ability applies to dice ‘just rolled’, this includes any rerolls from dice boosting. abilities affecting results are applied after rolls and boosting. abilities affecting this combat sequence must be used at the beginnning of the sequence before choice of powers; those affecting the next sequence must be used at the end of a sequence. the player with initiative goes first if there two players want to use abilities at the same moment. multi-character combat if there is more than one ready hero in the district, choose which hero will fight at the beginning of each combat sequence. combat does not end until the lead villain or all the ready heroes have been defeated. if one hero is defeated, the villain has initiative on the next sequence if the fight continues. winning the game the scenario details the victory conditions for the game. if the game ends on a specific condition or game round, the player with the most victory points is the winner. if there is a tie, the tied player who scored the scenario headline is the winner. otherwise, the tied player with the most team power-ups in play is the winner. special headlines special headlines may enter play as indicated on the scenario card. heroes may move onto a special headline as though it was a district, and then use another action to troubleshoot it. the special headline has no support space. a team nemesis may not attempt a master plan, though he may still take a scheming action is he is the archnemesis or the scneario has a mastermind icon. if the headline is solved the game ends when the current action round is completed, otherwise it remains in play to be solved later. the house of m scenario ends with a special confrontation with magneto (see page 12 of the rules)."

and ship class sheets. place the board on the table with the standard game side faceup. shuffle the first contact cards and place 1 card facedown in each system on the board. separate the market, goods, and racial technology tokens and group them by culture next to each culture’s supply area to the left side of the board. shuffle the encounter, reward, and mission decks and place them separately facedown near the board. sort the blue dot/asteroid, cargo hold tokens, drive, fame/ infamy, pirate, and telegate tokens by type and place them in stockpiles near the board. shuffle all passenger tokens and place them facedown in a stockpile near the board. each player chooses a color and takes the dashboard sheet, mission and merchant spaceport/drill tokens, and plastic merchant ship of that color. then each player chooses a pilot (human, eeepeeep, whynom, or qossuth) by taking the 2 corresponding pilot cards and placing the level 1 pilot faceup on the pilot card space of his dashboard sheet. deal 1 faceup mission card to each player. if your card has a destination, place your mission token in that system. randomly determine a first player and give them the first player card. sort the credit tokens into piles by denomination near the board. each player takes credits equal to the number of players x 20. counting clockwise from the first player, give the third player an extra c20 and the fourth player an extra c40. change may be made at the bank at any time. each player sets either his laser or shield dial to 2, then sets the other dial to 1. place the round marker on the 1 space of the round track. draw a passenger token from the passenger pool and place it on its specified starting location. each player places his merchant ship on the galactic base space. if players run out of credit, blue dot/asteroid, or fame/infamy tokens, use substitutes. all other components in the standard game are limited to the amounts in the box. game round at the start of each round (with the exception of the first) the first player advances the round marker 1 space on the game round track and resolves the effect of the round’s icon: passenger: the first player randomly draws a passenger token and places it on the starting culture indicated. if this starting culture has not yet been discovered, place the token in the corresponding culture’s supply area to the left of the board. drill: each player retrieves any drill tokens he has placed on the board and redeems them for c10 each. a player’s turn consists of 4 phases, performed in order. your turn ends when any of the following occurs: you finish your merchant spaceport phase; you fail a hazard check; an encounter card effect ends your turn; or you end your move step (or skip your movement phase) on any space other than a spaceport or a surface city. when your turn is over, the player to your left begins his turn. when the last player ends his turn, a new round begins.1. movement phase you may skip this phase to remain on your current space and end your turn. if you do so while on a surface city or spaceport, jump to the transaction phase. 1. declare heading if your ship is on any space other than a surface city or spaceport, declare your heading: point your ship in the desired direction along a connected path. if you fail to declare a heading before rolling speed dice, you must move along the path in the direction your ship currently faces. 2. set speed roll 3 speed dice to determine your movement value: the maximum number of movement points (mps) you can spend to move your ship during your move step. after rolling, you may be eligible to assign one of your rolled dice to your ship’s throttle to roll an additional speed die. you may never roll more than 4 speed dice during your turn, even if certain combinations of abilities say you may. 3. move spend your movement value to move along your current path. moving along a gray (solid or dashed) line costs 1 mp per space, while moving along a solid green line costs 2 mps per space. ships can move past one another without penalty. you cannot backtrack. if you exit a branching space in the same move step you entered it, declare which of the forward branches is your new heading, then continue your move step. 4. end movement end your movement phase by landing your ship or spending your entire movement value. ships can occupy the same space. you may only land on a surface city, spaceport, or asteroid. on a surface city or a spaceport, your movement phase ends; proceed to the first contact phase. if you land on an asteroid, your turn ends. if you do not land your ship, or are not stopped by other game effects, you must spend your entire movement value, after which your turn ends. assigning dice to use certain abilities, assign any of your rolled speed dice to the appropriate boxes on your dashboard. you can only assign dice during your movement phase, and only those dice rolled during your set speed step. a speed die always contributes its result to your movement value, even while assigned to an ability. you cannot change the value of a die when assigning it. the number of dice you can assign is equal to your pilot’s level. after you assign a die, it cannot be reassigned or removed for the rest of your turn. you may never assign more than 1 die to a die box on your dashboard. navigation assigning a die to your navigation die box gives you your navigation value for the turn, and determines how your ship moves through a navigation space or a telegate. throttle if any of your rolled speed dice show a 1, you may assign that die to your throttle die box to roll 1 additional speed die. the sum of the 4 rolled speed dice is your movement value for that turn. ship upgrades racial technologies that require an assigned speed die to function are called ship upgrades. assign a die to a ship upgrade by placing 1 of your rolled speed dice on the die box next to the upgrade you want to use.2. first contact phase if you end your movement phase on a surface city or neutral spaceport of a system with a first contact card: 1. flip it faceup to reveal which culture inhabits the system. 2. shuffle the culture’s 3 market tokens facedown, and place them in a faceup stack on the system’s market token space. any passenger tokens in this culture’s supply area are placed near the system’s market token area. 3. place the culture’s goods and racial technology tokens in their respective spaces, cost values faceup. 4. place credits equal to the culture’s iou value from the bank on top of the first contact card. 5. you may then immediately take up to 3 buy actions and up to 3 sell actions with that culture. the culture is now open for trade with any player who lands in its system, including the player who just discovered it. 3. transaction phase a player at a surface city or spaceport may trade with the system’s culture. you may perform the following actions: buy; sell; pick up a passenger and drop off a passenger. you may take any number of these actions, and in any order. if you land on a system’s surface city during the movement phase of the same turn, you can perform only 1 buy action and 1 sell action in the subsequent transaction phase. you may still pick up or drop off an unlimited number of passengers. this limitation does not apply to spaceports. the nebula habitat, the asteroid system, and the multi- generational ship do not have surface cities, only spaceports on which you must land to conduct your transaction phase. a. buy actions when trading, perform a buy action to purchase 1 of the following from the system’s culture: goods each culture sells 1 type of good (the goods tokens in its system’s market). buy a good by paying credits to the bank equal to its cost, taking the token from the culture’s market, and placing it in an eligible cargo hold below your dashboard.if you have no cargo hold space, you cannot buy goods unless you make room in your ship. when buying goods and racial technologies from a culture, you may purchase any of the goods and technology tokens in that system (you may look at the token backs at any time). equipment each culture has 2 pieces of equipment (lasers, shields, cargo holds, or drives) for sale as indicated by its market token. buy a piece of equipment by paying credits to the bank equal to its cost (shown on the culture’s market token). lasers & shields increase the appropriate dial by 1 point on your dashboard sheet. cargo holds you start the game with 2 (green) cargo holds and may purchase 2 additional cargo holds during the game. after you buy an additional hold, place a cargo hold indicator token above the leftmost available cargo hold on your dashboard to show it is now available to hold cargo. drives place a new drive on the drive token space on your dashboard, discarding any old drive. the yellow drive allows you to skip all yellow spaces on the board; the red drive allows you to skip all red spaces; and the combo drive allows you to skip all red and yellow spaces. if you do not wish to use your drive, announce this when declaring your heading.buying racial technologies there are 4 types of racial technology and each culture sells 1 type. you cannot have 2 or more of the same racial technology tokens at the same time (except the data probe). buy a racial technology by paying credits to the bank equal to its cost. you may use the racial technology’s ability (described on the back of the token) with the exception of ship upgrades, which require the assignment of a speed die. ship upgrades place the token to the right of the topmost available ship upgrade slot on your dashboard. if you have no available ship upgrade slots, you cannot buy another ship upgrade unless you make room. in order to use a ship upgrade ability, you must assign a rolled speed die to its corresponding die box during your movement phase. structural techs place the token in an eligible cargo hold. the icon also represents the tech’s capacity requirement (1 dot) you need in order to equip the tech. if you have no available room in your cargo holds, you cannot buy a structural tech unless you make room. special techs there are 2 special techs: a throttle boost is placed facedown in the throttle die box; a fuzzy dice token facedown above your dashboard sheet. utility techs place the token to the left of your dashboard. utility techs cannot be jettisoned or offloaded. using first contact credits when buying from a culture, the player who established first contact may use the iou credits placed on its first contact card. these are normal credits, but can only be spent with that culture. b. sell actions to sell goods, your ship must be on a surface city or spaceport of a culture that buys that particular type of good. the cultures to which a good can be sold are listed on each of its goods tokens. when selling goods, look at the token on top of the culture’s market token stack to see the market condition, and determine which price you receive for selling the eligible goods token to that culture. low market: the token is sold at its lowest resale value. high market: the token is sold at its highest resale value.active market: the token is sold at its center resale value. the resale values of tokens are listed on their reverse side. when you sell a good, receive its value in credits from the bank, then return the goods token to its culture’s supply area (not to the culture’s market). each sale of a goods token counts as 1 sell action. whenever you perform at least 1 sell action in a culture’s market, a market shift occurs: after completing all your sell actions, take the culture’s top market token and place it at the bottom of its market token stack. if this reveals an active market, that culture produces 1 goods token. c. picking up passengers to pick up a passenger, you must be at a surface city or spaceport of a system containing at least 1 passenger token. during your transaction phase, you can pick up any number of passengers at that culture by placing the passenger tokens in eligible cargo holds below your dashboard. most passenger tokens have a capacity requirement of 1 dot; the diva and caterer passenger tokens have a capacity requirement of 2 dots.c. dropping off passengers to drop off a passenger, you must be at a surface city or spaceport of the passenger’s destination system. collect the passenger’s fare in credits from the bank, plus any fame or infamy tokens specified on the passenger token. then remove the token from play by returning it to the game box. if the galactic base icon appears as the starting location or the destination of a passenger token, that passenger either starts on, or must be dropped off at, galactic base. 4. merchant spaceport phase spaceports printed on the board are neutral. you can build your own merchant spaceports at systems on an empty orbit space. if you performed 1 or more buy actions during your first contact phase or your transaction phase, you cannot build a merchant spaceport that turn. to build a merchant spaceport in a system, you must be on one of its surface cities and pay c200 to the bank. place a merchant spaceport token of your color on an empty orbit space connected by a single green line to the surface city on which you are located. then move your ship onto the new merchant spaceport token and end your turn. if there is no empty orbit space adjacent to a surface city, no merchant spaceport can be built there. to build a merchant spaceport in the asteroid system, you must be on one of the system’s neutral spaceports and pay c200 to the bank. place a merchant spaceport token of your color on the orbit space connected to the neutral spaceport by 3 contiguous green lines. then move your ship onto the new merchant spaceport token, place an asteroid token on the (now bankrupt) connected neutral spaceport, and end your turn. merchant spaceports are worth c200 at the end of the game, even if they were purchased at a discount. after you have or have not built a merchant spaceport, your turn is over. you cannot build more than 1 merchant spaceport in a single turn. trading on merchant spaceports after a merchant spaceport has been built, players can no longer move from the orbit space containing the merchant spaceport to the connected surface city. if all of a system’s orbit spaces contain merchant spaceports, players can no longer access that system’s surface cities and must conduct their transaction phases on its merchant spaceports. a player that conducts a buy or sell action at a merchant spaceport must pay the spaceport’s owner c10 for each buy or sell action. if you are unable to pay the c10 fee after the transaction, you cannot make the buy or sell action. for each buy or sell action you conduct at your own merchant spaceport, receive c10 from the bank instead of paying a fee. end of the game and winning the game ends when the last player ends his turn in round 30. each player then determines his final score: 1. sell merchant spaceports: remove all your merchant spaceports from the board, collecting c200 from the bank for each spaceport you remove. 2. count fame: total all fame tokens in your play area, and add the fame from your reward cards, completed mission cards, and your dashboard (for ship upgrades, additional cargo holds, and your laser and shield levels). ship upgrades and cargo holds cumulatively provide fame points for each upgrade; lasers and shields provide only the fame indicated by the current positions of their dials. if you have the fuzzy dice racial technology, roll 2 dice and gain fame equal to the total result. all players then lose 1 point of fame for each point of infamy they accumulated. a player with less than 0 fame cannot win the game and is disqualified at this point. 3. award bonus credits: receive credits equal to your total fame x10. if your fuzzy dice roll had the same result on both dice, instead receive credits equal to your fame x20. 4. determine final score: total the value of all credit tokens in your play area to find your final score. unspent credits on first contact cards do not contribute to your final score. the player with the highest score at the end of the game wins. on a tie, the tied player with the highest total fame is the winner. on a further tie, the tying players share the win. hazards, pirates and encounters navigation spaces your ship must exit a navigation space using the path that matches your navigation value. a ship can never exit a navigation space in the direction from which it entered during the same turn. if you have a die assigned to navigation that would force you to do so, instead end your turn there (this does not apply if you start your turn on a navigation space). if you cannot, or do not, assign a die to navigation before exiting a navigation space, the player to your left chooses your exit path (except the path you entered from that turn). telegates being transported between telegates does not cost mps. only a player who enters a telegate space with a normal (non-telegate) during his move step is affected by it: 1. assign a speed die to your navigation die box if you have not done so already. 2. if you have assigned a speed die, move your ship to the telegate with the number that matches your navigation value. if your navigation value matches the telegate number on your space, or if there is no telegate with that number, remain on your current space; continue your move step. 3. if you do not have a die assigned, roll the purple effect die and place your ship on the telegate with a matching number. if the result matches the telegate number on your space, or if there is no telegate with that number, remain on your current space; continue your move step. 4. after using a telegate, declare a new heading and continue your move step from the destination telegate. hazards when you enter a hazard space, make a hazard check by rolling the purple effect die and comparing its result to the corresponding attribute on your dashboard or pilot card. laser checks result less than your laser value: continue move step. result equal to or greater than your laser value: either end your turn on that hazard space or decrease your laser value by 1 and continue your move step (treating laser hazards for the rest of your turn as blue spaces). shield checks result less than your shield value: continue move step. result equal to or greater than your shield value: either end your turn on that hazard space or decrease your shield value by 1 and continue your move step (treating shield hazards for the rest of your turn as blue spaces). piloting checks result less than the pilot skill value on your pilot card: continue move step. result equal to or greater than the pilot skill value on your pilot card: immediately end your turn on that hazard space.pirates when you enter a pirate token space during your move step: 1. if you entered the area by using your last mp, you are ambushed. you automatically lose the engagement; skip the remaining steps. 2. choose an attribute (lasers, shields, or pilot skill). 3. roll the purple effect die and modify the result by the pirate token value. 4. if the result is less than the chosen attribute, you win the engagement. if the result is equal to or greater than the chosen attribute, you lose. winning: rolled vs pilot attribute: you may add mps up to that of your pilot’s level to your movement value. continue your move step, leaving the pirate token on its space. rolled vs shield attribute: receive 2 fame. continue your move step, leaving the pirate token on its space. rolled vs laser attribute: collect c20 for every infamy token under the pirate token; then convert them to fame by flipping them to their fame side. flip the pirate token to its asteroid side, draw a reward card, and end your move step. losing: if transporting 1 or more goods tokens with a color matching the pirate token, return 1 such goods token (your choice) to its culture’s supply area. if you have no matching goods token, pay c20 to the bank. if you cannot pay c20, pay all your remaining credits instead. then end your move step and place an infamy token beneath the pirate token. encounters when you enter an encounter space, draw and resolve an encounter card, then discard it and resume your move step unless otherwise instructed. tokens placed on the encounter space stay there for the rest of the game, replacing the space. when an encounter card with production and culture icons is drawn, in addition to the card’s other effects, take all of the goods tokens from the indicated culture’s supply area and return them to the market in that culture’s system (if the culture is not yet discovered, nothing happens). title cards remain in play and can change hands. intel cards are typically placed beside the round track and can be purchased by paying the card’s price and meeting its conditions. when used, they are usually returned to beside the track, again eligible for purchase. asteroids when entering a space containing an asteroid, you may end your turn in that space even if you have unspent mps. if your ship is equipped with the license to drill racial technology, you can place 1 of your drill tokens on an asteroid space as your ship passes over or lands on the space. only 1 drill token can be present on an asteroid space at a time. if you have placed all of your drill tokens on asteroids, you cannot purchase a merchant spaceport until you have recovered your drills. if you have used all your tokens as merchant spaceports, you cannot place drill tokens. market production when a culture’s market reveals a market token with a production icon (also known as an active market), the culture immediately produces another goods token, if able. if there are any goods tokens belonging to the culture in that culture’s supply area, the current player takes 1 such goods token from the culture’s supply area and places it in the goods token area of that culture’s system.if there are no goods tokens in a culture’s supply area, the active market produces nothing. goods are also produced when certain encounter cards are resolved. making room in a ship freight capacity is symbolized by the capacity icon and a number of capacity dots. goods tokens, passenger tokens, and some racial technology tokens have a capacity requirement of 1 or 2 dots. each of a player’s cargo holds has a capacity of up to 2 dots. reorganizing you may shift cargo (i.e. goods, passenger, and structural tech tokens) between cargo holds at any time if you do not exceed the capacity of any cargo hold while doing so. offloading at any time during your transaction phase, if you are located on a surface city or spaceport, you may offload any number of goods, racial technologies, or passengers. remove the tokens from your cargo holds and place them in your current system’s market. the offloaded tokens immediately become available for purchase or pickup. this makes it possible for markets to contain goods, technologies, and passengers that originated in other systems. offloading does not count as an action, and you do not receive credits for offloading tokens. goods and racial technologies cannot be offloaded at galactic base but passengers can be. jettisoning when you end your move step on any space other than a surface city or spaceport, you may jettison any number of goods, racial technologies, or passengers. goods or technology tokens are placed in their originating culture’s supply area at the side of the board. a passenger token is removed from the game; then roll 2 dice and take infamy tokens equal to the higher result. when you offload or jettison a ship upgrade tech, shift other equipped ship upgrade techs upwards on your dashboard so that available ship upgrade slots are always at the bottom. pilots you begin the game with a level 1 pilot on your dashboard. a pilot’s level is indicated by the level icon on his pilot card. upgrade to level 2: during your move step, you may upgrade your pilot from level 1 to 2 by landing at galactic base and paying c60 to the bank; flip your pilot card to its level 2 side. upgrade to level 3: during your move step, you may upgrade your pilot from level 2 to 3 by landing on a surface city or spaceport in the system containing your home culture and paying c60 to the bank. this cost is not reduced by your home culture discount. then choose which level 3 pilot ability you would like to use and place that side of the level 3 pilot card faceup on the pilot space of your dashboard, discarding the previous pilot card. you are then unable to use the other level 3 upgrade for the rest of the game. if you are on galactic base or a surface city or spaceport of your home culture but skip your movement phase, you may still upgrade your pilot immediately before starting your transaction phase. you receive a discount to all buy actions made in the system containing your pilot’s home culture. a level 1 pilot provides a c10 discount;

124,17835,MONSTERS MENACE AMERICA,2005,AVALON HILL (HASBRO),1.8418,316,"setup randomly choose a starting player. pile the stomp markers in a stack by the board: 20 markers for 4 players, 17 for 3 players, and 14 for 2 players. shuffle the mutation and research cards separately and place these 2 decks face down by the board. the first player chooses 1 of the 6 giant monsters and takes its piece and record tile, then the player to the left does the same and so on. each player adjusts the sliders on their tile to mark the monster’s starting (coloured) health. the last player to choose a monster chooses one of the 4 military branches (except national guard) and takes its record tile and military units. the player to his right does the same and so on. place the pieces where indicated on each tile. the national guard is not controlled by any player. place its tile and pieces near the board. if there are fewer than 4 players, the last player places the units for each unused military branch (except national guard) on that branch’s bases on the board (1 unit per base). the first player places his giant monster piece on one of the monster’s 3 possible starting lairs. then he either deploys his military units or draws a military research card. the player to his left does the same, and so on. the last monster to survive the monster challenge is king of the giant monsters and wins the game. game turn players take turns going left from the first player. on a player’s turn he must do the following in order: 1. move your monster and military units. 2. fight any battles you started. 3. encounter the space your monster ends its move on (unless it retreated there). 4. deploy new military units or draw a research card. 1. move during your turn you may move your monster and any number of your military units. monsters each turn your monster may move any number of spaces up to its move value (it does not have to move). it must stop as soon as it enters a space with any military unit. it can never enter or move through a space with a monster until the monster challenge. it cannot cross water barriers unless it has an appropriate ability. it does not encounter spaces it passes through.disappear: instead of moving, your monster can disappear. take the monster off the board, and on your next turn place it on one of your lairs, ending its move for that turn. its health returns to its starting value. military units each turn each of your military units may move any number of spaces up to its move value (it does not have to move). you can only move your own military branch’s units (not national guard). a unit must stop as soon as enters a space with a monster. however it can move freely through other units and giant units. any number of units can be in the same space, even if from different branches. a unit cannot cross water barriers unless it has an appropriate ability. movement abilities fly: ignores water barriers and can freely move through spaces with other units and monsters. lake: cross water barriers or inland bodies of water only. sea: can cross water barriers on sea spaces.sea/seacoast only: can enter a space only if its current space, the space it is moving into, and all spaces in between contain water. 2. fight a battle occurs if your monster ends its move in the same space as 1 or more military units (including your own), or if any of your units end their move in the same space as a monster (even your own). a battle consists of 2 rounds of combat. in each round the monster attacks first, then surviving military units. if you start several battles in a turn, choose what order to resolve them in. attacking for each attack you make, choose a single target. if a d6 roll is equal to or greater than the defense value of the target, it’s a hit. you can attack the same target more than once, and see whether you hit before choosing another. monsters: start the game with 3 attacks per round. they can attack only military units until the monster challenge. each infamy token can be cashed in for 1 extra attack at any time, including during the monster challenge. military units: get 1 attack per round. they can attack only monsters. mutations: some attacks might cause a monster to mutate; the monster’s player draws a monster mutation card and places it face up in front of him. when attacking with multiple units that cause mutations, roll for each attack separately. if the monster mutates, the card takes effect before the units attack. damage a monster or military unit’s damage value is the amount of damage it deals to a target when it hits. a monster loses health equal to the damage value, and a military unit (except for giant units) is destroyed regardless of the value. a destroyed unit returns to its branch’s record tile and is again available for deployment. a monster with 0 health goes to hollywood except during the monster challenge. smash: an attack roll of 6 deals 1 extra point of damage. retreating if any military units survive after 2 rounds of combat, the monster must retreat to an adjacent space. military units are either victorious or destroyed. a retreating monster does not encounter (no stomping or mutating) the space it retreated from or the space it retreats to. a monster can’t retreat into a space that contains other players’ units or monsters, or across a water barrier if it doesn’t have the appropriate ability. if it can’t retreat as a result, it must disappear. if your monster attacks enemy units in its turn and must retreat, it retreats to the adjacent space it came from. if your units attack a monster on your turn and force it to retreat, you choose the space it retreats to and draw a military research card. hollywood if your monster’s health drops to 0 before the monster challenge, place its piece in hollywood and discard any of its infamy tokens. if it happened on another player’s turn, that player draws a military research card. at the beginning of each turn your monster is in hollywood, roll d6 and add the result to its health. when it improves to 5 or more, during the move step place your monster on los angeles (unless another monster is there) or one of its starting lairs. this ends its move. a monster can’t disappear while in hollywood. nuclear submarine the navy’s nuclear submarines can fight as submarines (lay the piece on its side) or cruise missiles (stand the piece on its end); declare at the beginning of a battle how it is fighting (you cannot change your mind). unlike the air force’s missiles, you can’t move a navy cruise missile to a new position; you must launch it into battle on the turn you move it. all cruise missiles are destroyed after the first round of combat whether they hit or not.3. encounter stomp a monster stomps a space containing a city, military base, or infamy site. take a stomp marker and place it on the space. once stomped, it can’t be stomped again. the monster whose player places the last stomp marker declares the monster challenge. spaces containing multiple icons grant the benefit of each. city: the monster gains health as shown on the board (health can never be higher than 40). military base: take 1 infamy token. the player whose military branch owns the stomped base (it may be you) chooses a unit from that branch and gives it to you as a trophy. that player decides whether to remove the unit from the board or from that branch’s card, and it can no longer be deployed. infamy site: take 2 infamy tokens.a monster may never have more than 15 infamy at any one time. mutate a monster visiting a mutation site can mutate. draw a monster mutation card and place it face up in front of you. a monster can only mutate once at each site it visits; that space has no effect if it visits there later. challenge once the monster challenge has been declared, your monster can move to a challenge site to become the new challenger. nothing happens on this space before that time. encountering other spaces a space with no icons or a moster lair has no effect on a monster that ends its move there.4. deploy your military branch card tells you how many units you may deploy each turn. you can deploy only 1 military unit (from any branch) in a given space per turn. you can deploy units from your branch only on unstomped bases belonging to that branch. national guard units can be deployed on any unstomped city, base, or infamy site. you can deploy a unit in a space containing a monster (if it retreated there, for example), as long as the space is otherwise legal. military research you may draw a military research card instead of deploying units, placing it face up in front of you. redeploy you can redeploy a unit of your branch by removing it from the board and placing it on any one of your bases. this counts as deploying 1 unit from your branch. you can’t redeploy national guard units, captain colossal or mecha-monster. giant military units captain colossal and mecha-monster are giant military units that enter play through research cards. giant military units are removed from play permanently when their health reaches 0. they can’t mutate, stomp, or declare the monster challenge. they can be in the same space as other military units, including another giant unit. placing one on a base doesn’t count as deploying a unit there that turn. if one is in play during the monster challenge, it must be the last creature challenged, even if its controller also controls the challenging monster. giant units don’t ‘weigh in’ like monsters and never fight each other. if either is standing at the end of the monster challenge it has saved america and its controller wins the game.the monster challenge monsters in hollywood can’t participate in the monster challenge. challenging the monster whose player takes the last stomp marker is the challenger. the monster challenge begins in that monster’s space at the start of its player’s next turn unless another monster gets to one of the 4 challenge sites first (there are extra stomp markers in case other monsters stomp spaces in the meantime). if one of the other monsters reaches a challenge site after the monster challenge has been declared, that monster becomes the new challenger. the monster challenge will begin at the end of that turn. if a monster becomes the challenger by using the last stomp marker but is forced to retreat before the monster challenge begins, it is still the challenger. however, if it disappears or is sent to hollywood, it can no longer challenge. the new challenger is the first monster to reach one of the challenge sites. fighting once the monster challenge begins, follow these steps: 1. the challenger’s player chooses any other monster (except those in hollywood), which immediately appears on the challenger’s space. 2. the monster’s ‘weigh in’. note their health. 3. the monsters fight a battle, with the challenger attacking first in each round of combat. however, there is no round limit—the monsters keep fighting until one is at 0 health. 4. the winner of the battle gains health equal to the loser’s weigh-in value. 5. the winner of the battle is the challenger and chooses the next monster to fight. the new battle begins immediately. repeat these steps until one monster is left. miscellaneous if either deck runs out of cards, don’t reshuffle it. no more cards of that type can be drawn. monsters, some units and cards have special rules; in case of a conflict with the general rules, follow the rules for that monster, unit or card. military tactical tips 1. attack with 4 or more units as a group. 2. defend large cities worth 2 or 3 dice of health. delay the monster by placing single units in its path. 3. work with the other military branches to delay monsters and defend large cities. 4. don’t neglect research."
125,113997,MYSTERIUM,2015,ASMODEE,1.8469,209,"setup one player chooses to be the ghost and the other players are psychics. the ghost may choose to play the game without uttering a single word; eg, he might confirm the psychics’ intuitions by knocking on the table: one knock for yes, 2 knocks for no. each psychic takes 1 intuition token (crystal ball), 1 sleeve, 1 clairvoyancy level marker (place this pointing to the 0 space on the clairvoyancy track), and a number of clairvoyancy tokens depending on the number of players: 2-3 players: 0 4-5 players: 4 (numbered from 1 to 4) 6-7 players: 6 (numbered from 1 to 6) place the clock on the table with the hour hand set to i (the 1st hour). the space in front of the clock is the clairvoyance token discard area. set up the progress boards as shown in the rules (starting from the psychics’ end of the table: the character, location, object, and epilogue boards). place the clairvoyancy track around the epilogue progress board, with the side faceup that corresponds to the number of players. the ghost places the screen in front of him. each column corresponds to a different psychic, and each row corresponds to a type of ghost card: character, location, and object. choose the game’s difficulty level: permitted total # discards by players: 2 3 4 5 6 7 the ghost easy: 4 5 5 6 6 7 /turn medium: 5 6 6 7 8 8 /game hard: 6 7 7 8 9 9 /game the ghost takes the number of crow markers corresponding to the chosen difficulty level. shuffle the character psychic cards and draw (facedown) the number shown above. look through the character ghost cards and select the ones whose numbers match the drawn character psychic cards; pass these to the ghost. place the character psychic cards faceup next to the character progress board. the ghost shuffles the received character ghost cards and draws as many cards as there are psychics in the game. he places these in the character spaces on the inside of the screen, in the columns representing the colours of the various psychics. return any remaining cards to the box without looking at them.repeat these steps for the location cards and then the object cards, placing the drawn psychic cards next to the appropriate progress boards, and the ghost cards in the appropriate spaces on the inside of the screen. this generates a combination of 3 cards (character, location and object) for each psychic. the ghost takes 6 culprit tokens, 3 crow markers, and the ghost tokens corresponding to the psychcs in the game. place the ghost tokens behind the screen, coloured side up, at the bottom of the appropriate columns. place the vision deck behind the screen. the ghost starts the game by drawing a hand of 7 cards from the vision deck. gameplay phase 1: reconstruction of events the psychics attempt to identify, in order, which characters are crime suspects, where the deed might have been committed, and what objects might have served as the murder weapon. each psychic moves their intuition token along the 4 progress boards to visually represent their progress. the phase takes place in 2 steps: step 1: vision interpretation at the start of the first turn, place the psychics’ intuition tokens on the character progress board. the ghost’s task is now to help the psychics to guess the character card assigned to them behind the screen. he does this by projecting a vision to each psychic, consisting of one or more vision cards. to project a vision, the ghost: 1. chooses a psychic and places 1 or more vision cards faceup in front of him; 2. pushes the ghost token matching the psychic’s colour against the screen to remind the ghost that he has already given vision cards to that psychic and cannot give him any more cards in the current turn; 3. draws vision cards to bring his hand up to 7 cards. if the vision cards draw pile is empty, shuffle it to create a new draw pile; 4. picks another psychic and repeats the same procedure until all psychics have received at least one vision card. upon receiving a vision, each psychic attempts to interpret it and discover the character/location/object to which it refers (depending which progress board their intuition token is currently on). psychics may freely examine their vision cards and psychic cards, and discuss hypotheses with the other psychics.when the ghost has projected visions to all psychics, he starts the sand timer. before the sand timer runs out, each psychic must place his intuition token on the psychic card to which he believes the ghost is guiding him. the other psychics may help with decision-making by analyzing cards and giving their opinions. psychics may change the positions of their intuition tokens at any time until the sand timer expires. several psychics may place their intuition token on the same psychic card; however, as each psychic has to find a unique combination (character, location and object), at least one of those psychics must be wrong. although the ghost may listen to discussions between psychics, he should never make comments or gestures that could serve as clues. discarding vision cards at any point in the game (including during the revealing the culprit phase), the ghost may discard any or all of his vision cards and draw new cards to bring his hand to 7 cards (subject to the limit on the number of discard operations determined by the difficulty level). place a crow marker on the screen every time these option is taken to keep track. using clairvoyancy tokens at any time until the sand timer expires, players may add or remove clairvoyancy tokens to the intuition tokens played by the other psychic. these tokens enable psychics to progress on the clairvoyancy track, potentially unlocking extra clues when attempting to identify the culprit in the final phase of the game. there are 2 types of clairvoyancy tokens: tokens with the icon, indicating that the player agrees with the psychic’s intuition, and those with the icon, indicating the opposite. a psychic may not play more than 1 clairvoyancy token per intuition token or add a clairvoyancy token to his own intuition token. a psychic may play as many clairvoyancy tokens as he wants during a turn, but is not obliged to use any at all. as multiple intuition tokens may be placed on the same psychic card, each clairvoyancy token should clearly point to the token with which it is associated. after use, all clairvoyancy tokens must be discarded to the space on the clock board, to be retrieved at the start of the fourth game turn. when the sand timer runs out, the vision interpretation step ends. step 2: spectral manifestation the ghost manifests itself to let the psychics know whether or not they have correctly interpreted their visions. the ghost may reveal this information in any order he pleases. he informs each psychic that his intuition was correct (if the psychic’s token was placed on the right card) or incorrect (if the token was not placed on the correct card). after manifesting to a psychic, the ghost moves the ghost token of the corresponding colour away from the screen. if the psychic picked the correct psychic card: the ghost flips the corresponding ghost card in the screen. any psychics who played a clairvoyancy token move their markers forward 1 space on the clairvoyancy track. the psychic collects the correct psychic card and slides it into his sleeve, discards all his vision cards, then takes his intuition token and places it on the next progress board. if the psychic has not picked the correct psychic card: any psychics who played a clairvoyancy token move their marker forward 1 space on the clairvoyancy track. the psychic returns his intuition token to the same progress board from which it was taken, and retains his vision cards in front of him. in each subsequent turn, the ghost will provide 1 or more additional cards to enhance the vision, until either the correct psychic card is picked or the game ends. if a psychic has just obtained his 3 psychic cards: when a psychic has successfully identified his combination of psychic cards, he places his intuition token on the mission accomplished space on the epilogue progress board. he then moves his marker forward 1 space on the clairvoyancy track for each hour remaining on the clock. thereafter, he continues to take part by helping the other psychics to interpret their visions, and may still play any remaining clairvoyancy tokens. at the end of this step, move the hour hand forward 1 hour on the clock. the psychics’ intuition tokens may be located on different progress boards. if one or more psychics have not yet identified their character, location and object, a new reconstruction of events phase begins. if the clock was already showing the vii (the 7th hour), the game ends and all players lose. if all the psychics have successfully identified their character, location and object combinations, move on to phase 2: revealing the culprit.phase 2: revealing the culprit this phase only takes place if all the psychics have successfully identified their character, location and object combinations before the clock strikes viii. step 1: suspect line-up the psychics arrange their combinations of cards into groups, in order to compare the suspects and enable the ghost to identify the culprit. collect any psychic cards that were not placed in sleeves and return them to the box, together with the character, location and object progress boards. the psychics collect all of their clairvoyancy tokens. place 1 ghost token per psychic in the centre of the table, numbered side up. return the unused ghost tokens to the box. the psychics remove their combinations of 3 cards from their sleeves and associate them with the numbered tokens, forming several groups of cards in the center of the table, each containing 1 suspect. step 2: shared vision the ghost attempts to guide the psychics towards the group of cards in the middle of the table that contains the culprit. the ghost picks 3 vision cards from his hand. these cards form a shared vision and must all point to the same group. one of the cards must point to the character in the target group, another to the location, and one to the object. the ghost then shuffles the shared vision cards and places them facedown in the middle of the table. this is the culprit’s group. the ghost secretly takes the culprit token with the number matching that group and places it facedown in the culprit space on the epilogue progress board. step 3: straw poll the psychics hold a majority vote to pick the group containing the suspected culprit. the ghost must not indicate which card in the shared vision relates to which element of the combination. the psychics vote in secret, and cannot communicate with each other during the procedure. psychics vote at different times, depending on their clairvoyancy level, as determined by the position of their clairvoyancy level marker on the clairvoyancy track. psychics with a low clairvoyancy level will see only 1 card from the shared vision before voting to identify the culprit’s group; psychics with an intermediate clairvoyancy level will see 2 cards; psychics with an high clairvoyancy level will see all 3 cards. psychics vote using the numbered sides of their clairvoyancy tokens. each psychic takes the token bearing the number of the group that he thinks contains the culprit and slides it into his sleeve. when all psychics have voted, the votes are revealed.revealing the votes and the true culprit pass all the sleeves to the psychic with the highest score on the clairvoyancy track (on a tie, to the eldest of the tied players). this player reveals each clairvoyancy token in turn, placing it on the card group matching the number on the ghost token. when all tokens have been placed: if one of the groups has received more votes than the others, it is the suspected culprit’s group. if no single group has a clear majority, the tie is broken in favor of the group chosen by the player who progressed furthest along the clairvoyancy track. that group is the suspected culprit’s group. if a tie persists, it is broken in favour of the group for which the eldest player voted. reveal the culprit token placed on the culprit space. end of the game if the group chosen by the psychics contains the true culprit, all players win the game together and the ghost’s spirit is laid to rest. otherwise, the game is lost. 2 and 3 player game modifications setup 1. the clairvoyancy track, the related markers and the clairvoyancy tokens are not used; 2. each player plays with 2 psychics; 3. during the shared vision, the 3 vision cards are placed faceup. phase 2: revealing the culprit step 1: suspect line-up 2 players: randomly create 2 additional groups of cards (with a character, a location and an object in each group) using psychic cards discarded during the game, bringing the total number of groups to 4. then place the tokens numbered 1 to 4 by the 4 groups thus formed. 3 player: place the tokens numbered 1 to 4 by the 4 groups of cards. step 3: straw poll 2 players: the player who plays the 2 psychics uses only one of his intuition tokens to designate the suspected culprit’s group. 3 player: psychics vote openly rather than in secret. the 2 players with the role of psychics must agree which group to identify as the suspected culprit’s group and place their 2 intuition tokens on it."
127,3072,NECROMUNDA,1999,GAMES WORKSHOP,3.1131,168,"setup & turn sequence players choose and prepare gangs, choose a scenario and set up appropriate tabletop scenery. each side takes a full turn in succession. each phase is completed before beginning the next: movement shooting hand-to-hand recovery games last until one side bottles out , withdraws, is destroyed, or a specific objective is achieved. movement move models one at a time in the following order: 1. chargers 2. compulsory moves 3. the rest moving, running and charging models move up to their m in inches (even on ladders). a model may run at double rate but cannot shoot in the same turn, and must stop if within 8"" of an enemy he can see. models wishing to engage in hand-to-hand (h-to-h) combat must declare a charge and move at double rate into base-to-base contact (or separated by a low wall or obstacle) with the enemy. if the model does not reach the enemy it is moved as close as possible and can do nothing for the rest of the turn. hiding a model can hide by ending its move in a concealed position. declare the model is hidden and place a hidden counter next to it—it cannot be seen or shot at. a model that runs or charges may not hide that turn. a model that shoots, moves so that it can be seen, or can be clearly seen by an enemy, is no longer hidden. a model automatically spots all hidden enemies within its i score in inches. terrain difficult terrain: half rate. very difficult terrain: quarter rate. barriers less than 1"" high and 1"" wide can be leapt over at no cost, but those 1""-2"" high and no more than 1"" wide cost half of a model’s total move to climb over. barriers higher than 2"" are impassable. falling and jumping falling: a model pinned, down or losing a h-to-h combat within 1"" of an edge will fall off on a d6 roll greater than his i. if he loses a h-to-h combat he also falls on a roll of 6. damage is a hit with a s equal to the fall in inches. a fall of up to 3"" inflicts 1 wound, and more than 3"" inflicts d6 wounds. a fall of more than 12"" takes the model out of action automatically. armour saves apply with save modifiers. in any case, the model is automatically pinned. a model in the way of a falling model is hit on a 4+, damaged and pinned as per the faller. position surviving models 1"" apart. use this rule when a model ‘charges’ a model on a lower level. jumping: if the vertical distance is 3"" or less, take an i test: failure means a fall, success means the model has landed safely and must stop, and a roll of 1 means the model may continue moving. jumps over 3” are treated as falls. horizontal jumps are d6"" and may be part of a charge.shooting one at a time, models not in h-to-h combat may shoot once with a weapon at a target within a 90º arc to their front. the model must be able to see some part of the target’s body. you must shoot at the closest target unless a more distant target is easier to hit. check range: if the target is out of range the shot is wasted; still roll to hit to see if the weapon requires an ammo roll . hitting and wounding subtract bs from 7 to find the number needed to hit and apply hit, range and cover modifiers. a roll of 1 is always a miss. see if the shot wounds the target by comparing the s of the weapon with the target’s t on the wound chart and rolling a d6. roll armour saves, taking into account weapon save modifiers. pinning a model hit is knocked over, placed faceup, and is pinned . he can do nothing, but if pinned at the start of his turn will automatically recover at the end of his turn. models cannot be pinned by h-to-h hits. a model engaged in h-to-h combat will automatically escape pinning. if a model has at least one of his gang within 2"" that is not a juve, down or broken he can try to escape pinning at the start of his turn by rolling equal to or less than his i. injuries when a model suffers its last wound roll for the injury: 1 flesh wound -1 from ws and bs for the rest of the game. if both reach 0 the model is out of action. 2-5 down model is placed facedown and may only crawl 2"". roll again to what happens to the model at the end of his recovery phase. 6 out of action the model is removed from play. if a model goes down or out of action each friend within 2” must make a ld test. if a weapon inflicts multiple wounds make another injury roll for each extra wound inflicted after the final wound. a model can suffer multiple flesh wounds. high impact weapons (strength of 7+) cause an out of action result on a roll of 5-6. other shooting rules if shooting into a h-to-h combat distribute hits randomly between all participants. some heavy weapons preclude movement in the same turn as shooting. blast weapons nominate the target and roll to hit; if the shot hits, center the blast template over the target. models wholly under it are hit. any model partially within the template is hit on a 4+ on d6. if the shot misses make a scatter roll. roll the artillery and scatter dice—a number shows how far you have missed the target in inches, and direction is indicated by the arrow. no shot may scatter more than half the range between the shooter and the target. a misfire indicates no effect. a hit and a misfire indicates the weapon may have exploded in the breach (see exploding weapons). grenades a model carrying grenades has enough to last the entire battle. throwing a grenade is like using a blast weapon, but the maximum range is based on the thrower’s s. s 1 4"" s 2 6"" s 3 8"" s 4 10"" s 5 or more 12"" the number on the artillery dice is halved if the throw scatters (the maximum scatter limit does not apply). roll a d6 on the misfire table if the scatter and artillery dice turn up hit and misfire. grenades thrown at a point on the ground are at -1 to hit (small target). flamers both flamers and hand flamers use the large teardrop-shaped template. models wholly under it are hit automatically. any model partially within the template is hit on a 4+ on a d6. hit modifiers for range, cover etc do not apply. hand flamers get only 1 shot per game. sustained shooting if a weapon is capable of sustained fire declare a single or sustained shot. for sustained fire, roll d3s equal to the weapon’s sustained fire value to determine the number of shots. each shot is treated separately and can be made at the same target or another model within 4"" of the original target. at least 1 shot must be allocated to the original target. ammo rolls a score of 6 on a hit roll indicates a d6 ammo roll is required, in addition to normal effects. if you roll less than the weapon’s ammo roll number it is useless for the rest of the game. some weapons must make an ammo roll every time they are fired. grenades automatically fail any ammo roll they make, indicating you have thrown your last grenade of that type. exploding weapons if an ammo roll is a 1 the weapon is not only useless, but there is a chance it may explode. if a further d6 roll is less than the weapon’s ammo roll rating, inflict an automatic hit on the user with a s value of -1. blasts are confined to the user. weapons with a rating of auto automatically fail their ammo roll but will may still explode on a further roll of 1. overwatch a model may go on overwatch at the start of its turn if it is not down, pinned or broken. it may not move, shoot or go into hiding (but may remain hidden) during its turn, but may shoot at any target as it presents itself at any time during the enemy’s turn. once the model has fired, is hit, forced to move, or at the end of the enemy’s turn, it is no longer on overwatch. declare the overwatch shot and determine the position of the enemy model at the moment of fire. there are modifiers to hit an emerging or disappearing target, or being charged by the target, whilst on overwatch. stray shots if a shot misses with a 1 to hit, and it passed within ½"" of a friend, it hits the friend on a further roll of 1. if several friends are eligible randomise who is hit.hand-to-hand combat models in base-to-base contact are in hand-to-hand combat; all models fight regardless of whose turn it is. they cannot shoot in the shooting phase or move away in their movement phase. 1 throw attack dice both players roll d6s equal to their a. 2 work out combat score each picks their highest scoring dice and adds his model’s ws and any combat modifiers to it. 3 determine winner the highest combat score wins. if a tie the model with the highest initiative wins. 4 number of hits the difference between combat scores is the number of times the winner has hit (still once if it was a tie). 5 throw to wound roll a d6 on the wound chart for each hit using the s value of the weapon (unless noted). 6 saving throw armour saving throws if appropriate, modified by weapon save modifiers. 7 resolve injuries in the same way as for shooting. weapons only h-to-h weapons and pistols may be used. all fighters carry a knife. weapons cannot be swapped during combat. one extra dice is rolled if the model carries a h-to-h weapon in each hand (hits are inflicted alternately). parrying fighters with swords may parry by forcing an opponent to re-roll his highest attack dice before working out his combat score. two combatants with swords cancel the ability out. criticals and fumbles any attack dice rolls of a 1 indicate a fumble. for each fumble the opponent may add +1 to his combat score. at least two attack dice rolls of a 6 indicate a critical hit. the first 6 is your highest score and each extra 6 counts as a +1 to your combat score. multiple combats in an order chosen by the outnumbering player, the out-numbered model must fight each opponent in succession. each subsequent enemy after the first gains an extra attack dice and a +1 to their combat score (cumulative). follow up if all a model’s h-to-h opponents go out of action he may make a follow-up move of 2"" out of the normal turn sequence. a model may also cross an obstacle without penalty or engage another enemy for the next turn’s combat (no charge bonus) with a follow-up move. fighters down a fighter that goes down is automatically out of action. in multiple combats some fighters can go down and crawl away 2"" during their move phase, as long as at least one continues to fight. breaking from combat a model broken while fighting h-to-h breaks off and takes one immediate automatic hit from his enemy.leadership & recovery take a leadership test by rolling 2d6. if the score is more than the model’s ld the test is failed. if a model goes down or out of action each friend within 2"" must make a leadership test. if the test is failed the model is broken. if he can stay and hide he will do so. otherwise the model will immediately run 2d6"" away from his enemy and towards the nearest cover. if he can reach a position of cover he stops, if not he runs the full distance rolled. in subsequent movement phases he moves another 2d6"" until he reaches such a position. he may not otherwise move or shoot. if a broken fighter is forced into h-to-h combat his ws is counted as 0. if he survives the round, he automatically breaks and runs for cover. remember, a model breaking from combat takes one immediate automatic hit from his enemy. recovering your nerve a broken fighter in cover that cannot be seen by an enemy may attempt to recover by making a leadership test during the recovery phase. a model may not be broken and recover in the same turn. leaders a fighter within 6"" of the gang leader may use the leader’s ld when testing, unless the leader is down or broken himself. the bottle test this leadership test is made at the start of the turn if a quarter or more of a player’s gang is down or out of action. if failed the gang loses the fight and the game ends. use the leader’s ld unless he is down or out of action, in which case use the remaining fighter with the highest ld. a player may voluntarily fail a bottle test. the conditions for the test must still be met and the player still loses the game. attacking structures structures have a t value and can sustain a certain number of wounds. most are large targets are therefore +1 to hit. instead of shooting, krak grenades or melta bombs can be placed on a structure within 1"" of the fighter—the target is hit automatically. structures in base contact with a model can be hit in h-to-h if the fighter did not shoot or fight in h-to-h combat that turn. each attack equals 1 automatic hit. psychology make a 2d6 leadership test in the following circumstances: fear if a model is charged by a model that causes fear and fails the test, the model is broken. if a model wishes to charge a model that causes fear and fails, the model can do nothing for the rest of the turn. make the tests when the charges are declared. a model that causes fear does not have to test for fear, and if confronted by terror tests for fear instead. terror circumstances are as for fear above. also if the model is within 8"" of the thing causing terror at the start of your turn. if the test is failed the model is broken and must run to cover as the model’s move for that turn. a model that causes terror is unaffected by fear and terror.stupidity test at the start of the model’s turn. if failed: roll a d6 before each h-to-h phase: 1-3 roll no attack dice this turn; ws still counts 4-6 fight normally roll a d6 to determine movement: 1-3 roll a scatter dice and move the model a full move in that direction. if it comes into contact with an enemy it becomes engaged in h-to-h combat as above. 4-6 model does not move the model can do nothing else that turn except run if he is broken. he does not have to take any fear or terror tests. hatred if a model hates his adversaries all leadership tests are taken with a ld of 10. a model fighting h-to-h with a hated foe may re-roll any attack dice in the first turn of combat, and must use his 2"" follow-up move to engage a hated enemy if possible, or at least move toward one. frenzy if an individual is frenzied: the model must always charge the closest enemy within charge range if able to do so. the model doubles his attacks, and cannot parry.the model must use his 2"" follow-up move to engage in h-to-h combat if possible. otherwise they must move closer to the enemy. the model is unaffected by frenzy, terror, stupidity or hatred. if the frenzied model is broken , these rules no longer apply. a player may wish to regain control over a frenzied model by making a ld test at the start of his turn. if successful this lasts until the start of the following turn. gangs house goliath house van saar house delaque house cawdor house orlock house escher gangs are set up with 1,000 guilder credits. anything remaining is the gang’s stash. a gang can be of any size from 3 models upwards, and must consist of 1 leader, any number of gangers and up to 2 heavies. no more than half the gang can be juves. all models are equipped with a knife for free. other weapons are bought from the gang’s weapons list. some are restricted to the leader when the gang is created, but later any ganger may purchase them. only 1 heavy weapon can be carried by a model. juves can only use h-to-h weapons, pistols and knives. determine each fighter’s initial experience: juves 0, gangers 20+1d6, heavies and leaders 60+1d6. hired guns underhive scum bounty hunters ratskin scouts wyrds pit slaves special characters hired guns can be recruited when a gang is created, or after any game, by paying the hire fee per battle. they do not count as part of a gang for collecting income or living expenses, cannot modify or sell their weapons and equipment, and they do not earn experience. for the purposes of calculating the gang rating, they are equal to their hire fee x 5.outlaws & outlanders outlawed gangs redemptionists ratskin renegades scavvies spyre hunters reporting a gang after a game, either player may report the incident to the guilders’ watchmen (unless the reporting gang is an outlaw or outlander gang). the accused player rolls 2d6 on the outlaw table (p8, outlanders book). outlaw gangs territory new outlaw gangs lose all but one of their territories. if this last territory is lost after a game, roll on the outlaw territory table (p10, outlanders book) for a new one. only one territory can be held at a time; an extra territory can be occupied and the old one abandoned, or it can be looted for its basic income value (or double the maximum if variable). collecting income a gang’s non-outlaw territory still supplies income if worked by a ganger, but income is halved. foraging any ganger who survives a game and is not performing any other tasks may go foraging, collecting d6 credits worth of supplies each. food & supplies each member of the gang must receive 3 credits worth of supplies to function. any model missing out on receiving these supplies suffers a cumulative -1 to strength and toughness per game until they do. a strength or toughness of 0 indicates starvation. weapons and equipment may be kept by other gangers. spending cash outlaws use the outlaw trading post tables (p14, outlanders book). hired guns, new recruits and rare items (outlaw trade table: p13, outlanders book) are available normally. scenarios outlaws roll on the outlaw scenario table (p16, outlanders book), but may both outlaw and normal gangs use either table if they get to choose. bounty any non-outlaw gang which captures or kills outlaws may collect a reward from the watchmen equal to the each outlaw’s total cost. if an outlaw is captured he may be exchanged as normal or sold for the bounty plus a bonus of d6x5 credits. regaining non-outlaw status an outlawed gang may buy off its outlaw status for 10% of their gang rating, as set when they become outlawed. generate 5 new pieces of norrmal territory. the outlaw territory may be discarded or kept as one of the 5. each time an outlaw gang plays another game against a non- outlaw gang add another d6x10 to this price. gang rating gang rating = value of fighters + experience serious injuries (p41, sourcebook) models which go out of action must roll d66 on the serious injuries chart at the end of the game. fighters who are down at the end of the game recover fully on a d6 roll of 1-3 and go out of action on a 4-6. experience (p42-49, sourcebook) determine each ganger’s initial experience. experience is gained after a fight as dictated by the scenario. a gang fighting a gang with a higher gang rating earns extra experience points.as gangers earn experience points they are entitled to a 2d6 roll on the advance roll table when they go up a level, taken immediately after the game when the advance is gained. juves become gangers after they have earned 21 experience points. new skills types are picked according to the skill types available table. choose a type and roll a d6 to determine the skill. characteristic increases may not go beyond maximum limits: m ws bs s t w i a ld maximum value 4 6 6 4 4 3 6 3 9 territory (p50-53, sourcebook) every gang begins with 5 territories from the territory table. at the end of a battle a gang can collect income from its territories. each ganger that does not go out of action can collect income from one territory, up to a maximum of 10 gangers. leaders, heavies and juves never collect income. cross reference the gang’s income with the number of models in the gang to find the profit remaining after deducting maintenance costs. this is added to the gang’s stash. a gang beating a gang with a higher rating receives a giant killer income bonus. the trading post (p54-57, sourcebook) cash can be spent on new recruits armed with weapons from the gang recruitment list, mercenary fighters (hired guns), or new weapons and equipment from your house weapons list. new recruits must fight at least one battle before being given other equipment. weapons must be of an appropriate type for the fighter. the number of rare items available is determined by a d3 at the start of the trading session. roll a d66 for each item on the rare trade chart. for each ganger used to search out rare items you may add a another randomly generated rare item, but these gangers cannot collect income. before rolling for items on the rare trade list, you may instead choose to use one or more of those offers to purchase weapons not on your house weapons list. each non-house weapon purchased reduces your rare trade offers by one. common equipment is accessible to all and does not cause a reduction in rare trade items. gangs with specialized starting weapons lists treat their list as a house weapons list. equipment can be automatically sold for half their price. rare items with a variable price fetch half the fixed price component.the value of fighters includes equipment. variable cost equipment is worth the fixed price component only. when a fighter is killed all his equipment and weaponry is lost. campaign game sequence pre-battle sequence 1. player with the lower gang rating rolls on the scenario table. the player who picks the scenario is the attacker. 2. roll for fighters with old battle wounds or head wounds. 3. set up terrain and gangs according to the scenario. post battle sequence 1. determine the extent of injuries for each fighter out of action. roll for injuries on the serious injuries chart. 2. allocate experience points and make advance rolls. 3. re-allocate territory if appropriate. 4. collect income from territory. 5. recruit new fighters and buy new equipment. 6. update total gang rating."

action deck until they have a hand of 5 cards. if your deck is empty, first shuffle the cards in your discard pile to form a new action deck. 2: first player token on every turn except the first, the player with the first player token passes it to the player on their left. if players need to do anything in order, start with the player with the first player token and continue in clockwise order. 3: player turns starting with the first player and going clockwise, each player performs a turn of 2 actions. continue performing turns in order until all players have passed, then go to the event phase. when you pass, you may discard any number of cards from your hand. then flip your help card to the pass side. if you cannot or choose not to perform any actions you must pass. if you perform only 1 action instead of the required 2 you must pass. once you pass you cannot perform any actions later that same turn and round. passing counts as taking an action in the player turn. a character who finishes a turn in a room with a fire marker suffers 1 light wound. this happens even if they pass, but once they pass they do not suffer any more wounds from fire this round. ii: event phase 1: launch css if there is a css token under the time token, reveal it and check which css pods are launched this round. 2: time track move the time token on the time track 1 slot to the right. check if you have to resolve the autodestruction sequence/alert procedure. on power thresholds, check if the power has to be reduced. 3: noise removal in sections with power, remove all noise markers in the corridors not connected to rooms with characters. do not remove noise markers from the technical corridors space. 4: intruder attacks each intruder in the same room as a character performs an attack. 5: intruder fire damage each intruder in the same room as a fire marker suffers 1 injury. 6: resolve event card draw and resolve 1 event card. if the event deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile to form a new event deck.1. intruder movement: all intruders with the intruder symbol shown (and not in a room with any characters) move to a neighboring room through the corridor indicated by the number shown. if there are 2 numbers, move the intruder types through the corridor with the first number, then through the corridor with the second number (if the intruder enters a room occupied by a character, do not move it further). if the number indicates a technical corridor, remove the intruder miniature from the board and put its corresponding intruder token in the intruder bag. if the number indicates a corridor with a door, the intruder does not move and the door is destroyed. 2. event effect: resolve the effect on the card. some cards have additional effects only resolved in sections without power. 7: intruder bag development draw 1 intruder token from the intruder bag: larva: remove this token from the intruder bag and add 1 adult token to the bag. creeper: remove this token from the intruder bag and add 1 breeder token to the bag. adult: all players, in order, perform a noise roll. if your character is in combat with an intruder, you do not perform a noise roll. return the token to the bag. breeder: all players, in order, perform a noise roll. if your character is in combat with an intruder, you do not perform a noise roll. return the token to the bag. queen: if there are any characters in the nest, place the queen there and resolve an encounter. otherwise, or if the nest is undiscovered, place an additional egg token on the laboratory board. return the queen token to the bag. blank: add 1 adult token to the intruder bag (nothing happens if there are none available). return the blank token to the bag. critical moments first intruder encounter: when the first intruder miniature of any type (not eggs) appears on the board, each player immediately chooses 1 of their objective cards to remove from the game facedown. the encounter is then resolved. first dead character: the first time any character dies, the facility immediately opens the main gate. remove its token. isolation room: when the time token reaches a white (#8) slot on the time track, the isolation room becomes usable. characters cannot lock themselves there before this happens. autodestruction sequence: if any character performs the cooling system room action, place the autodestruction token 3 slots forward on the time track, yellow side up. while it is yellow side up, players can turn off the sequence in the power generator room. during the event phase of the round marked by the yellow autodestruction token, just after moving the time token, move the token another 3 slots forward and flip it to the red side. when the time token is on a slot with the yellow autodestruction token and has to move further, the main gate opens (remove its token) and characters can no longer stop the autodestruction sequence. during the event phase of the round marked by the red autodestruction token, the facility is destroyed and all characters and intruders in the facility die. actions the number in an action symbol is the cost to perform that action. discard that exact number of any action cards from your hand faceup to your discard pile. the cost must be paid even if the action is interrupted by another player, and if a one use only item action is cancelled, discard the item. contamination cards are not action cards and cannot be discarded to pay any action cost. in combat only: a character may only perform this action in combat (if there is an non-egg intruder in their room). out of combat only: a character may only perform this action when they are not in combat. basic actions each character has the same set of basic actions. regardless of combat movement: move to a neighboring room directly connected by a corridor (closed doors block movement). when performing a movement in combat, you must escape instead. out of combat careful movement: move as normal, but instead of performing a noise roll after moving, place a noise marker in a chosen corridor connected to the room you are entering. if there is a noise marker in all the corridors connected to the room, or you are in combat, you cannot perform this action. pick up heavy object: pick up 1 heavy object (character corpse, intruder carcass, or egg) in the room you are in. you don’t need to use this action if you search and find heavy items. trade: start a trade with all characters in the same room. players may reveal and exchange any item cards and objects they want to trade. even though several players may take part in the trade (with or without the active player), the only player that performs the action is the one that started it. you may choose to give an item card or object without asking anything in return. characters cannot exchange ammo. craft item: discard 2 item cards showing blue component symbols to gain a crafted item with the same gray symbols. in combat shoot: attack an intruder with an energy/classic weapon in your hand, discarding an ammo marker from that weapon’s card. you can only shoot intruders in the same room. you may also shoot uncarried eggs outside of combat. melee attack: attack an intruder in the same room with bare hands or an improvised weapon. actions from action cards: you have a set of 10 action cards you may perform. discard the card from your hand faceup and pay its cost (in addition to the action card with the performed action). if an action card contains 2 sections separated by [or], choose the one you want to perform. actions from item cards and room tiles . computer actions: each character in a section with power and in a room with a computer may use a computer action to perform one of the 3 actions on the revealed computer card. afterwards, place the card on the bottom of the deck and reveal the next one. whenever a lock-down card is revealed, immediately resolve it. movement & exploration characters and intruders may be placed and perform actions only in rooms (css pods and the bunker are the exceptions). they may never stop in corridors; the effects of moving through a corridor are resolved after moving into the room. characters may not access technical corridors entrances or the technical corridors space, except with the use of certain cards. the facility is divided into 3 sections, each with its own power source. the elevator power token is a separate fourth section. after entering a room: 1. if the room tile was unexplored (facedown), turn it faceup. then reveal and resolve the exploration token on that room tile. 2. if the room is empty (explored or unexplored, but no other characters or intruders), perform a noise roll. exploration tokens 1. set up number of items in a room after revealing an exploration token, rotate the room tile until the number on the token faces the item counter symbol on the board next to the room tile slot: this is the number of items that can be obtained from the room. do not set this number in the nest room. 2. resolve special effect after resolving an exploration token, remove it from the game. silence: nothing happens. do not perform a noise roll for this movement. if this token was revealed due to a careful movement, you still place a noise marker. if you have a slime marker on your character board, resolve danger instead. danger: do not perform a noise roll for this movement. if there is an intruder in a neighboring room that is not in combat with any character, move it to this room. if there is more than 1 eligible intruder, move them all. if there are no intruders in any of the neighboring rooms (or if they are in combat), place a noise marker in each corridor connected to the room without a noise marker in it (including technical corridors). slime: place a status marker in the indicated slot of your character board: you have been covered with slime. fire: place a fire marker in the room. malfunction: place a malfunction marker in the room. doors: place a door token in the corridor through which you entered the room. door tokens can never be placed in technical corridors. noise roll to resolve a noise roll, roll a noise die: 1, 2, 3 or 4: place a noise marker in a corridor with the matching number that is connected to the room you entered (including technical corridors). silence: see above under resolve special effect. danger: see above under resolve special effect. noise markers a corridor may never have more than 1 noise marker. if you have to place a noise marker in a corridor that already contains one, resolve an encounter instead. if a marker must be placed and the number leads to a technical corridor entrance, place it on the technical corridors space. intruder movement if an intruder ends its movement in an unexplored room, do not reveal the room or its exploration token. if an intruder moves to a technical corridors entrance, it disappears in the ducts: discard all its injury markers, return its token to the intruder bag, and remove its miniature from the board. if there was a noise marker on the technical corridors space, do not remove it. when an intruder tries to move through a corridor with a closed door token, it does not move, but destroys the door instead. if several are moving from the same room, their movement is simultaneous: they destroy the door and all stay in the starting room. if you must place an adult intruder and all 8 models are already on the board, they retreat. remove all adult intruders not in combat and put the corresponding intruder tokens back in the intruder bag (if possible). then, place an adult intruder model in the room where the encounter occurred.markers doors door tokens are only placed in corridors and a corridor may never hold more than one. they do not affect noise markers. open doors are indicated by removing the door token from the corridor. at the start of the game, all corridors have open doors. if there are no door tokens left when you must place a door, take any non-destroyed door token on the board. closed doors (standing door token) prevent characters, intruders, and thrown grenades moving through the corridor. when one or more intruders try to move through a corridor with a closed door (including after a danger result on a noise roll), they do not move, but destroy the door instead. destroyed (door token lying down) allow movement through the corridor. a destroyed door can never be closed again. fire if you must place a fire marker and there are none left, the facility explodes and the game ends. a room may never hold more than 1 fire marker (if you must place another, nothing happens). they may be placed in an unexplored room. you can still use a room or search action when there is a fire marker in a room. malfunction if there is a malfunction marker in a room, that room’s action is unavailable (you may still search). a malfunction marker can never be placed in the nest or in the contaminated room. if there is a malfunction marker in a room with a computer, the computer is unavailable (as if there was no computer symbol). if you must place a malfunction marker and there are none left, the base is destroyed and the game ends. a room may never hold more than 1 malfunction marker (if you must place another, nothing happens). they may not be placed in an unexplored room. slime you may never have more than 1 slime marker at a time (if you get another, nothing happens). you may get rid of a slime marker by using the clothes item card or by taking a decon room action. encounters an encounter occurs when, after drawing an intruder token from the intruder bag, an intruder appears in a room where there is a character. they may also be triggered by the effects of some event or intruder attack cards. an intruder moving from one room to another room where there is a character is not an encounter. if you enter a room occupied by an intruder, do not resolve an encounter: you and the intruder are immediately in combat. to resolve an encounter: 1. discard all noise markers from all the corridors connected to the room (including technical corridors). 2. draw 1 intruder token from the intruder bag. there are 2 numbers on the back: use the smaller blue number if you are not in darkness, and the larger red number if you are. 3. place an intruder miniature in the room of a type corresponding to the intruder symbol on the token. 4. if the number of action cards (including contamination cards) in your hand is lower than the number on the intruder token, a surprise attack occurs. otherwise nothing happens. put the drawn intruder token aside; it may return to the bag if an intruder of that type hides (by entering the technical corridors during intruder movement). if you draw the blank token, place a noise marker in each corridor connected to the room in which the encounter took place. if this was the last token in the intruder bag, add 1 adult intruder token to the bag. if there are none available, nothing happens. return the blank token to the intruder bag and the encounter ends.combat a character and an intruder in the same room are in combat. character attacks intruder during your action round, you may attack an intruder in the same room using a shoot action (if you have an energy/classic weapon with at least 1 ammo) or a melee attack action. shoot action: 1. choose a weapon and 1 intruder to shoot. 2. discard 1 ammo from the weapon’s card. 3. roll the combat die if in a section without power, or the advantage die if in a section with power (see reference sheet). melee attack action: 1. draw 1 contamination card and add it to your action discard pile. 2. choose 1 intruder to attack. 3. roll the combat die (the advantage die is not used in melee). character escape during your action round, you may try to escape from combat by performing a movement action to go to a neighboring room (explored or unexplored). before moving, resolve a separate intruder attack for each intruder in the room you are escaping from. if you die, your character corpse stays in the room you tried to escape from. if you survive, end your movement in the neighboring room. if there is no one in that room, perform a noise roll; if it is unexplored, explore it as normal. intruder attack intruder attacks happen during a surprise attack, the intruder attack step in the event phase, or during a character escape. each intruder attack follows these steps: 1. choose a character in the same room as the target. if there is more than one, intruders attack the character with the fewest action cards in hand. on a tie, the character with the first player token (or the next player in turn order) is attacked. surprise attack: the target is whoever triggered the encounter. escape: the target is whoever is performing the escape action. 2. draw and resolve 1 intruder attack card. if the card has an intruder symbol matching the attacking intruder, resolve the card effect (ignore the blood symbol), including any additional effects resolved only in sections without power, if appropriate. if not, the attack misses. after resolving an intruder attack card, place it on the intruder discard pile. if the intruder attack deck runs out of cards, reshuffle its discard pile to form a new deck. infest: if the intruder attack is performed by a larva, do not draw any intruder attack cards. instead, if the targeted player doesn’t have a larva miniature on their character board, remove the larva from the board and place it on their board. the player then takes 1 contamination card. attacking players characters cannot directly attack other characters, but may accidentally or intentionally harm them as a side effect of their actions. character wounds and death when you suffer a light wound, place a wound marker in the upper space of your light wound track on your character board. if a marker is already there, move it to the lower space (where it represents 2 light wounds). if there is already a wound marker on the lower space, discard it and suffer a serious wound. draw 1 serious wound card (identical cards are not cumulative). from now on, you are affected by the effect described on it. if you have 3 serious wounds and suffer any additional wound (light or serious), you are killed. remove your miniature from the board and place a character corpse token and all your heavy objects in the room. remove your other items from the game. dressing and healing wounds dress serious wound: flip a serious wound card affecting you to its other side. from now on, ignore its effect, but it still counts against the limit of 3 serious wounds. heal: either remove (light wound) or discard (dressed serious wound card) the wound mentioned in the action effect. intruder injuries and death when an intruder suffers injuries, place the corresponding number of injury markers on its base. then check the injury effect: larva or egg: remove the miniature from the board. creeper or adult intruder: draw 1 intruder attack card. ignore everything on it except the blood symbol. if the number in the symbol is equal to or lower than the current number of injury markers on the intruder, remove its miniature and place 1 intruder carcass token in the room. otherwise, the intruder stays alive. breeder or queen: draw 2 intruder attack cards, add the blood symbol values, and compare the total to the current number of injury markers on the intruder. resolve as above. during the injury effect check, if there is a retreat arrow in the blood symbol of any of the drawn intruder attack cards, the intruder flees. draw an event card and move the intruder through the corridor whose number appears in the card’s intruder movement section; then discard the card. the queen and breeders will retreat if any of the 2 cards drawn has the retreat symbol. contamination cards when you draw a contamination card, place it on top of your action discard pile. contamination cards do not provide any additional actions and cannot be spent to pay action costs. if any rule asks you to remove a contamination card, place it at the bottom of the deck. whatever the procedure to get rid of the card, it requires a scan. place the scanner’s red part over the coded field of the contamination card. if the word infected does not appear, the card is not infected. if it does appear, place a larva miniature on your character board (and do not remove this contamination card). if there is already one on your character board, your character dies, and you place 1 creeper in the room where you died. power a facility section has power when its power token is on the blue side. the section has these additional rules: 1. use the advantage combat die when performing a shoot action. 2. use special computer actions in rooms with a computer symbol. 3. characters in the section are not in darkness for game effects. 4. remove noise markers in the section during the event phase. characters in sections without power are in darkness. characters in darkness always resolve the higher value on a drawn intruder token. power thresholds are on the time track. red thresholds reduce the power only if the backup power is not activated (time token on red side). blue thresholds always reduce the power. each time the time token crosses a threshold, check if the threshold activates. if the token is on its red side, it activates when it crosses any threshold. if it is on its blue side, it activates only when it crosses a threshold with 2 time token symbols. if the threshold activates, flip the active power token with the highest number to its inactive/red side. knowledge and weakness knowledge characters gain knowledge when performing these actions: • 3 knowledge: analyzing a weakness in the laboratory room or using the analyze toolset (regardless of what was discovered). discard the object used. • 1 knowledge: using a specific computer action. • 1 knowledge: discovering the nest. • 2 knowledge and flipping your knowledge token to its active side: using the archive room action. if your knowledge token is active, you cannot use the archive room again. • # knowledge: using some items or actions. weakness to discover a weakness card, any character can research one of the available objects (character corpse, intruder carcass, or egg) in the laboratory room. after researching an object, place it in the first empty slot of the intruder board and reveal the weakness card below it. heavy objects are discarded when researched. you cannot discover weaknesses using the same type of object multiple times, but you can still analyze the same type of object any number of times to gain knowledge. objects and items character hands and inventory there are 2 types of item cards: heavy items (kept in your hands) and normal items (kept in your inventory). you may also carry object tokens, which are all heavy (character corpse, intruder carcass, and egg). all normal items may be kept secret from the other players in your inventory (plastic card holder). other players can only see the color of the items. when any item card is used it must be shown to all other players. there is no limit to the number of items that can be in your inventory. heavy items (as weapons) are indicated by the hand symbol. they can never be kept secret from the other players and cannot be put in your inventory. when you gain a heavy item (or pick up a heavy object) you wish to keep, it must be placed in 1 of your 2 hand slots. if both of the hand slots are already taken and you want to take another heavy item/object, you must drop 1 of the carried heavy items/objects. each weapon acquired during the game comes into play loaded with ammo tokens. the first number is the starting number of tokens and the second is its maximum ammo capacity. a weapon can never exceed its ammo capacity. sometimes, you can add an item card to another item card; place the added item next to the indicated item card. from now on, both cards are treated as one. the duct tape item card allows you to combine 2 heavy items, so they take up only 1 hand slot (but it doesn’t apply to objects). item cards marked as one use only must be discarded after use. drop you may drop any item/object from your hands/inventory any time during your turn without using an action. objects remain in the room where they are dropped. items are lost (return them to the bottom of their deck). searching apart from the character-dedicated items, there are 4 colors of items: red (military), yellow (technical), green (medical), blue (crafted). the red, yellow, and green decks contain items which can be found in rooms when using a search action. the color of any item found during a search action should match the color of the searched room (the background color under its name and rule text). when searching in a white room, the player can choose to draw from any of these 3 decks. each time a character performs a search action in a room, reduce the room’s item counter by 1. when the item counter reaches 0, the room has been emptied and cannot be searched anymore. crafting blue deck item cards are crafted items which can be assembled out of other items you have. you may look through this deck at any time. a crafted item cannot be built if its card is not available, even if you have the required blue components. to build a crafted item, perform a craft item basic action and discard 2 item cards showing the blue component symbols corresponding to the grey components symbols of the crafted item you want to build. then draw the desired crafted item card from the deck. quest items once the requirement of your quest card is fulfilled, it is flipped faceup on its vertical side and becomes a normal item card. player goals and game end to win, you must fulfill the objective on your objective card and survive by either: • locking your character in the isolation room with the facility not destroyed or • using one of the css pods to evacuate the facility or • reaching the bunker. if you use a css pod, isolate, or die, you can no longer participate in the game. at the end of the game, only characters that are still alive determine if their objectives have been met and if they have won or not. the game ends when one of these conditions is met: a. the time token reaches the final s space of the time track. the facility is purged by corporation forces, regardless of the active contingency token. all characters not in the isolation room die. b. the time token is on the same slot as the red autodestruction token and has to advance further or you must place a 13th fire marker or an 11th malfunction marker. the facility explodes: all characters in the facility (even those who have used the isolation room) and all intruders and their queen die. c. the last living character in the facility (excluding those who have used the isolation room) dies, uses the isolation room, flees to the bunker, or uses a css pod. if the autodestruction sequence was active, move the time token to the slot with the autodestruction token. if not, move the time token to the final red slot of the time track. resolve the effects of those tokens as described above. if the alert procedure was active, move the time token to the slot with the alert procedure token. if not, move the time token to the final red slot of the time track. resolve the effects of those tokens as described above. if both autodestruction sequence and alert procedure were active, they both count as the way of ending the game. if one of the conditions above is met and at least 1 character survived (either locked in the isolation room, safe in the bunker, or evacuated in a css pod), go to the victory check step.victory check 1. contingency check reveal the active contingency token and apply its effect to all living characters. 2. contamination check each living character (either locked in the isolation room, safe in the bunker, or evacuated in a css pod) scans their contamination cards. a. if there is a larva on your character board, skip this step. scan all the contamination cards in your action deck, discard pile, and hand. if there is at least 1 infected card, resolve step b. b. shuffle all your cards (both action and contamination) to create a new action deck, then draw the 4 top cards. if you draw at least 1 contamination card ( infected or not), you die. if there are none, you survive. 3. objective check if there are any characters still alive, each of them reveals their objective card to the other players and checks to see if they have met all its requirements. there can be more than 1 winner. objectives player x’s character cannot survive: that player’s character cannot be alive at the end of the game. your character is the only survivor: no character but yours may survive the game. no nemesis character can survive: no survivor, lab rat, or any character from nemesis or the aftermath expansion can survive the game. sending the signal: you must locate the transmitter control room and perform its room action. discover a weakness: weaknesses can be discovered by bringing an object (intruder egg, character corpse, or intruder carcass) to the laboratory and performing the laboratory room action. it doesn’t matter who does the research, as long as the weakness has been discovered at the end of the game. intruder eggs may be found in the nest. destroy the nest: the nest is destroyed when there are no intruder eggs left in it. to destroy eggs, see the nest room. solo & cooperative mode solo mode this mode has its own solo/coop objectives deck. at the start of the game, draw 2 cards from this deck (instead of the regular objective cards). once the first encounter occurs, you must choose 1 of these 2 objective cards. to win, you must fulfill your objective and survive. after placing the active contingency, draw 2 tokens from the neutral pool instead of 1. reduce the items available in each room by half, rounding up. fully cooperative mode at the start of the game, place 1 contingency token in the active contingency slot, and the rest of the tokens in the neutral pool. draw 1 of these tokens and reveal it to all players. the rest will be revealed during the game; place them next to the first revealed token. this mode has its own solo/coop objectives deck. at the start of the game, draw 1 card per player (instead of the regular objective cards). these cards are public information. to win the game, all these objectives must be fulfilled and at least 1 character must survive. if there is 1 card requiring you to send the signal, only 1 character must fulfil it. if there are 2 or more such requirements, that many characters must send the signal. the emergency room allows the crew to revive any near-death character. when a character dies, another character may pick up their corpse token and carry it to the working emergency room. a player whose corpse is in the emergency room places their character miniature there at the start of the next round. all their light wounds are discarded and all their serious wounds are dressed. the emergency room does not work if there’s an intruder or a malfunction token in it. using original nemesis characters if including characters from the original game, your character draft card allows you to use the character of that same color from the base game or the aftermath expansion. nemesis characters are counted as nemesis survivors and always begin with 3 knowledge, in the isolation room. with the exception of the pilot, who uses the action deck from nemesis: lockdown, characters use their original action decks. all characters start without a starting item card and use the quest item cards from nemesis: lockdown. using intruders in nemesis: lockdown to use the original intruder miniatures in nemesis: lockdown: • remove the vulnerability to fire and susceptibility to phosphates intruder weakness cards from the game. • flip the night stalkers laboratory board to the intruders laboratory side and place 5 egg tokens in the nest slot, and 3 random intruders weakness cards facedown at the board’s bottom edge. return the remaining weakness cards to the box. • replace the night stalker tokens with intruder tokens. • place the lockdown intruders event deck (instead of the basic intruders event deck) and intruders attack deck next to the board. discovering a weakness follows nemesis: lockdown rules, with the exception that a revealed weakness card is active for all players without the need to reach certain knowledge levels."
129,167355,NEMESIS,2018,AWAKEN REALMS,3.4226,892,"setup use the basic side of the board (red arrows icon). shuffle all #2 room tiles and randomly place 1 tile facedown on each of the #2 room slots, then return the remaining #2 tiles to the box. in the same way, place all #1 room tiles on the #1 room slots. shuffle the exploration tokens facedown, and place 1 token facedown on each room tile. return the rest to the box. place 1 random coordinates card facedown on the space next to the cockpit. return the rest to the box. place 1 status marker on the b space on the destination track: this is now the destination marker. place 1 status marker on the green space of the time track: this is now the time marker. take this number of randomly chosen escape pod tokens: 2 (1-2 players); 3 (3-4 players); or 4 (5 players). return the rest to the box. place the lowest-numbered pod in section a, then the next highest numbered pod in section b. place the other pods in increasing numerical order, alternating between a and b. place escape pod tokens with their locked side faceup. shuffle both #1 engine tokens facedown and place them on the engine 1 slot on the board, one atop the other, facedown. the top engine token indicates the true status of the engine. repeat this procedure for engine tokens #2 and #3 on the 2 and 3 slots. place the intruder board next to the board and place 5 egg tokens and 3 random facedown weakness cards in the appropriate slots (character corpse, intruder egg, and intruder carcass). return the remaining weakness cards to the box. place these intruder tokens in the intruder bag: 1 blank, 4 larvae, 1 creeper, 3 adults, and 1 queen. then add 1 additional adult intruder token for each player. place the rest of the intruder tokens next to the board along with the intruder carcass tokens. shuffle and place these decks facedown next to the board with space for a faceup discard pile next to each: 3 items (each with its own color), event, intruder attack, contamination and serious wound. place the crafted item deck next to the 3 item decks, and the scanner next to the contamination deck. return all intruder player action cards and all solo / coop objective cards to the box. place the rest of the markers, tokens and dice next to the board. take as many help cards (use the lowest numbers, up to the number of players) as there are players and randomly deal 1 to each player. return the rest to the box. the number shown on your help card is your player number. each player takes the plastic inventory card holder with their number to keep their item cards hidden during the game. remove all cards showing a number of players higher than the number playing the game from both objective decks (corporate and personal). shuffle the decks separately and deal each player 1 facedown card from each, then return the rest to the box. shuffle the character draft cards. player 1 takes 2 random character draft cards, reveals them, chooses 1 and shuffles the other back into the character draft deck. then player 2 chooses their character the same way, then player 3, etc. a player may only control the character whose card they have chosen. after the draft, return the remaining character draft cards to the box. each player takes their chosen character’s character board and places their character’s miniature (in a colored ring) in the hibernatorium. return the rest of the character boards to the box. take your character’s action card deck, shuffle it, and place it facedown to the left of your character board. take your character’s starting item card, if available, and place it in one of the 2 hand slots on your character board. place a number of ammo markers equal to that item’s ammo capacity on the item card. place your character’s quest items, horizontal side up and inactive, next to your character board. player 1 takes the first player token. place the blue character corpse token in the hibernatorium (treat this token as a character corpse object). the blue character corpse token is always assigned to the first dead body found on the ship. game sequence i: player phase 1: draw action cards all players draw cards from their action deck until they have a hand of 5 cards. if your deck is empty, first shuffle the cards in your discard pile to form a new action deck. 2: first player token on every turn except the first, the player with the first player token passes it to the player on their left. if players need to do anything in order, start with the player with the first player token and continue in clockwise order. 3: player rounds starting with the first player and going clockwise, each player performs a round of 2 actions. continue performing rounds in order until all players have passed, then go to the event phase. when you pass, you may discard any number of cards from your hand. then flip your help card to the pass side. if you cannot or choose not to perform any actions you must pass. if you perform only 1 action instead of the required 2 you must pass. once you pass you cannot perform any actions later that same phase. a character who ends their round in a room with a fire marker suffers 1 light wound but won’t suffer any more wounds from fire this round, even if other characters play their turn after them. ii: event phase 1: time track move the time marker on the time track 1 space to the right. if the self-destruct sequence is active, also move its marker 1 space to the right. 2: intruder attack each intruder in the same room as a character operforms an attack. 3: fire damage each intruder in the same room as a fire marker suffers 1 injury. 4: resolve event card draw and resolve 1 event card. if the event deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile to form a new event deck. 1. intruder movement: all intruders with the intruder symbol shown (and not in a room with any characters) move to a neighboring room through the corridor indicated by the number shown. if the number indicates a technical corridor entrance, remove the intruder miniature from the board and put its corresponding intruder token in the intruder bag. 2. event effect: resolve the effect on the card, then discard it (unless specified otherwise). 5: intruder bag development draw 1 intruder token from the intruder bag:larva: remove this token from the intruder bag and add 1 adult token to the bag. creeper: remove this token from the intruder bag and add 1 breeder token to the bag. adult: all players, in order, perform a noise roll. if your character is in combat with an intruder, you do not perform a noise roll. return the token to the bag. breeder: all players, in order, perform a noise roll. if your character is in combat with an intruder, you do not perform a noise roll. return the token to the bag. queen: if there are any characters in the nest, place the queen there and resolve an encounter. otherwise, or if the nest is undiscovered, add an egg token to the intruder board. return the token to the bag. blank: add 1 adult token to the intruder bag (nothing happens if there are none available). return the blank token to the bag. critical moments first encounter: when the first intruder miniature of any type (not eggs) appears on the board, each player immediately chooses 1 of their objective cards to remove from the game facedown. the encounter is then resolved. first dead character: the first time any character dies, all escape pods are automatically unlocked (flipped to their unlocked side). they may subsequently be locked (and unlocked) normally. self-destruct and hibernation: when the time track reaches any blue space, the hibernation chambers open. characters cannot enter them before this happens. when the self-destruct track reaches any yellow space, all escape pods are automatically unlocked and the characters can no longer stop the self-destruct sequence. actions the number in an action symbol is the cost to perform that action. discard that exact number of any action cards from your hand faceup to the discard pile. the cost must be paid even if the action is interrupted by another player, and if a one use only item action is cancelled, discard the item. contamination cards are not action cards and cannot be discarded to pay any action cost. if an action does not have either of the following symbols, it may be performed both in and out of combat: in combat only: a character may only perform this action in combat (if there is an non-egg intruder in their room). out of combat only: a character may only perform this action when they are not in combat. basic actions each character has the same set of basic actions. movement: move to a neighboring room directly connected by a corridor (closed doors block movement). when performing a movement in combat, you must escape instead. careful movement: move as normal, but instead of performing a noise roll after moving, place a noise marker in a chosen corridor connected to the room you are entering. if there is a noise marker in all the corridors connected to the room, or you are in combat, you cannot perform this action. shoot: attack an intruder with a weapon in your hand, discarding an ammo marker from that weapon’s card. you can only shoot intruders in the same room. you may also shoot uncarried eggs outside of combatmelee attack: attack an intruder in the same room with bare hands or an improvised weapon. pick up heavy object: pick up 1 heavy object in the same room (character corpse, intruder carcass, or egg). you don’t need to use this action if you search and find heavy items. trade: start a trade with all characters in the same room. players may reveal and exchange any item cards and objects they want to trade. even though several players may take part in the trade (with or without the active player), the only player that performs the action is the one that started it. you may choose to give an item card or object without asking anything in return. characters cannot exchange ammo. craft item: discard 2 item cards showing blue component symbols to gain a crafted item with the same gray symbols. actions from action cards: you have a set of 10 action cards you may perform. discard the card from your hand faceup and pay its cost (in addition to the action card with the performed action). if an action card contains 2 sections separated by [or], choose the one you want to perform. actions from item cards and room tiles: some item cards and most rooms allow you to perform specific actions. movement & exploration characters and intruders may be placed and perform actions only in rooms (escape pod tokens are the exception). they may never stop in corridors; the effects of moving through a corridor are resolved after moving into the room. characters may not access technical corridor entrances or the technical corridors space, except with the use of certain cards. after entering a room: 1. if the room was unexplored (facedown), turn it faceup. then reveal and resolve the exploration token on that room tile. 2. if the room is empty (explored or unexplored, but no other characters or intruders), perform a noise roll. exploration tokens 1. set up number of items in a room after revealing an exploration token, rotate the room tile until the number on the token faces the item counter symbol on the board next to the room tile slot: this is the number of items that can be obtained from the room. do not set this number in the nest or in the room covered in slime. 2. resolve special effect after resolving an exploration token, remove it from the game. silence: nothing happens. do not perform a noise roll for this movement. if you have a slime marker on your character board, resolve danger instead. danger: do not perform a noise roll for this movement. if there is an intruder in a neighboring room that is not in combat with any character, move it to this room. if there is more than 1 eligible intruder, move them all. if there are no intruders in any of the neighboring rooms (or if they are in combat), place a noise marker in each corridor connected to the room without a noise marker in it (including technical corridors). slime: place a status marker in the indicated slot of your character board: you have been covered with slime. fire: place a fire marker in the room. malfunction: place a malfunction marker in the room. doors: place a door token in the corridor through which you entered the room. door tokens can never be placed in technical corridors.noise roll to resolve a noise roll, roll a noise die: 1, 2, 3 or 4: place a noise marker in a corridor with the matching number that is connected to the room you entered (including technical corridors). danger: if there is an intruder in a neighboring room that is not in combat with any character, move it to this room. if there is more than 1 eligible intruder, move them all. if there are no intruders in any of the neighboring rooms (or if they are in combat), place a noise marker in each corridor connected to the room without a noise marker in it (including technical corridors). silence: nothing happens; do not place a noise marker. if you have a slime marker on your character board, resolve danger instead. noise markers a corridor may never have more than 1 noise marker. if you have to place a noise marker in a corridor that already contains one, resolve an encounter instead. if a noise marker must be placed and the number leads to a technical corridor entrance, place the marker on the technical corridors space. intruder movement if an intruder ends its movement in an unexplored room, do not reveal the room or its exploration token. if an intruder moves to a technical corridors entrance, it disappears in the ducts: discard all its injury markers, return its token to the intruder bag, and remove its miniature from the board. if there was a noise marker on the technical corridors space, do not remove it. when an intruder tries to move through a corridor with a closed door token, it does not move, but destroys the door instead. if several intruders are moving from the same room, their movement is simultaneous: they destroy the door and all stay in the starting room. if you must place an adult intruder and all 8 models are already on the board, they retreat. remove all adult intruders not in combat and put the corresponding intruder tokens back in the intruder bag (if possible). then, place an adult intruder model in the room where the encounter occurred. markers doors door tokens are only placed in corridors and a corridor may never hold more than one. they do not affect noise markers. open doors are indicated by removing the door token from the corridor. at the start of the game, all corridors have open doors. if there are no door tokens left when you must place a door, take any door token on the board. closed doors (standing door token) prevent characters, intruders, and thrown grenades moving through the corridor. when one or more intruders try to move through a corridor with a closed door (including after a danger result on a noise roll), they do not move, but destroy the door instead. destroyed (door token lying down) allow movement through the corridor. a destroyed door can never be closed again. fire if you must place a fire marker and there are none left, the ship explodes and the game ends. a room may never hold more than 1 fire marker (if you must place another, nothing happens). they may be placed in an unexplored room. you can still use a room or search action when there is a fire marker in a room. malfunction if there is a malfunction marker in a room or special room, that room’s action is unavailable (you may still search).a malfunction marker can never be placed in the nest or in the room covered in slime. a malfunction marker in the hibernatorium has no effect on already hibernated characters. the status of the engines is never affected by a malfunction marker. if there is a malfunction marker in a room with a computer, the computer is unavailable (as if there was no computer symbol). if you must place a malfunction marker and there are none left, the ship loses hull integrity and the game ends. a room may never hold more than 1 malfunction marker (if you must place another, nothing happens). they may not be placed in an unexplored room. slime you may never have more than 1 slime marker at a time (if you get another, nothing happens). you may get rid of a slime marker by using the clothes item card or by taking a shower room action. encounters an encounter occurs when, after drawing an intruder token from the intruder bag, an intruder appears in a room where there is a character. they may also be triggered by the effects of some event or intruder attack cards. an intruder moving from one room to another room where there is a character is not an encounter. if you enter a room occupied by an intruder, do not resolve an encounter: you and the intruder are immediately in combat. to resolve an encounter: 1. discard all noise markers from all the corridors connected to the room (including technical corridors). 2. draw 1 intruder token from the intruder bag. 3. place an intruder miniature in the room of a type corresponding to the intruder symbol on the token. 4. if the number of action cards (including contamination cards) in your hand is lower than the number on the intruder token, a surprise attack occurs. otherwise nothing happens. put the drawn intruder token aside; it may return to the bag if an intruder of that type hides (by entering the technical corridors during intruder movement). if you draw the blank token, place a noise marker in each corridor connected to the room in which the encounter took place. if this was the last token in the intruder bag, add 1 adult intruder token to the bag. if there are none available, nothing happens. return the blank token to the intruder bag and the encounter ends. combat a character and an intruder in the same room are in combat. character attacks intruder during your action round, you may attack an intruder in the same room using a shoot action (if you have a weapon with at least 1 ammo) or a melee attack action. shoot action: 1. choose a weapon and 1 intruder to shoot. 2. discard 1 ammo from the weapon’s card. 3. roll the combat die (see reference sheet). melee attack action: 1. draw 1 contamination card and add it to your action discard pile. 2. choose 1 intruder to attack. 3. roll the combat die (see reference sheet). character escape during your action round, you may try to escape from combat by performing a movement action to go to a neighboring room (explored or unexplored). before moving, resolve a separate intruder attack for each intruder in the room you are escaping from. if you die, your character corpse stays in the room you tried to escape from. if you survive, end your movement in the neighboring room. if there is no one in that room, perform a noise roll; if it is unexplored, explore it as normal. intruder attack intruder attacks happen during a surprise attack, the intruder attack step in the event phase, or during a character escape. each intruder attack follows these steps: 1. choose a character in the same room as the target. if there is more than one, intruders attack the character with the fewest action cards in hand. on a tie, the character with the first player token (or the next player in turn order) is attacked. surprise attack: the target is whoever triggered the encounter. escape: the target is whoever is performing the escape action. 2. draw and resolve 1 intruder attack card. if the card has an intruder symbol matching the attacking intruder, resolve the card effect (ignore the blood symbol). if not, the attack misses. after resolving an intruder attack card, place it on the intruder discard pile. if the intruder attack deck runs out of cards, reshuffle its discard pile to form a new deck. infest: if the intruder attack is performed by a larva, do not draw any intruder attack cards. instead, if the targeted player doesn’t have a larva miniature on their character board, remove the larva from the board and place it on their board. the player then takes 1 contamination card. attacking players characters cannot directly attack other characters, but may accidentally or intentionally harm them as a side effect of their actions. character wounds and death when you suffer a light wound, place a wound marker in the upper space of your light wound track on your character board. if a marker is already there, move it to the lower space (where it represents 2 light wounds). if there is already a wound marker on the lower space, discard it and suffer a serious wound. draw 1 serious wound card (identical cards are not cumulative). from now on, you are affected by the effect described on it. if you have 3 serious wounds and suffer any additional wound (light or serious), you are killed. remove your miniature from the board and place a character corpse token and all your heavy objects in the room. remove your other items from the game. dressing and healing wounds dress serious wound: flip a serious wound card affecting you to its other side. from now on, ignore its effect, but it still counts against the limit of 3 serious wounds. heal: either remove (light wound) or discard (dressed serious wound card) the wound mentioned in the action effect. intruder injuries and death when an intruder suffers injuries, place the corresponding number of injury markers on its base. then check the injury effect: larva and egg: remove the miniature from the board. creeper or adult intruder: draw 1 intruder attack card. ignore everything on it except the blood symbol. if the number in the symbol is equal to or lower than the current number of injury markers on the intruder, remove its miniature and place 1 intruder carcass token in the room. otherwise, the intruder stays alive.breeder or queen: draw 2 intruder attack cards, add the blood symbol values, and compare the total to the current number of injury markers on the intruder. resolve as above. during the injury effect check, if there is a retreat arrow in the blood symbol of any of the drawn intruder attack cards, the intruder flees. draw an event card and move the intruder through the corridor whose number appears in the card’s intruder movement section; then discard the card. the queen and breeders will retreat if any of the 2 cards drawn has the retreat symbol. contamination cards when you draw a contamination card, place it on top of your action discard pile. contamination cards do not provide any additional actions and cannot be spent to pay action costs. if any rule asks you to remove a contamination card, remove it from the game. whatever the procedure to get rid of the card, it requires a scan. place the scanner’s red part over the coded field of the contamination card. if the word infected does not appear, the card is not infected. if it does appear, place a larva miniature on your character board (and do not remove this contamination card). if there is already one on your character board, your character dies, and you place 1 creeper in the room where you died. intruder weakness cards to discover a weakness card, any character can research one of the available objects (character corpse, intruder carcass, or egg) in the laboratory room. after researching an object, flip the corresponding weakness card faceup and leave it on the intruder board. discovered weakness cards modify the basic rules of the intruders, giving all players a small advantage. objects and items character hands and inventory there are 2 types of item cards: heavy items (kept in your hands) and normal items (kept in your inventory). you may also carry object tokens, which are all heavy (character corpse, intruder carcass, and egg). all normal items may be kept secret from the other players in your inventory (plastic card holder). other players can only see the color of the items. when any item card is used it must be shown to all other players. there is no limit to the number of items that can be in your inventory. heavy items (as weapons) are indicated by the hand symbol. they can never be kept secret from the other players and cannot be put in your inventory. when you gain a heavy item (or pick up a heavy object) you wish to keep, it must be placed in 1 of your 2 hand slots. if both of the hand slots are already taken and you want to take another heavy item/object, you must drop 1 of the carried heavy items/objects. each weapon acquired during the game comes into play loaded with 1 ammo token. a weapon can never exceed its ammo capacity, shown on the card. sometimes, you can add an item card to another item card; place the added item next to the indicated item card. from now on, both cards are treated as one. the duct tape item card allows you to combine 2 heavy items, so they take up only 1 hand slot (but it doesn’t apply to objects). item cards marked as one use only must be discarded after use. drop you may drop any item/object from your hands/inventory any time during your turn without using an action. objects remain in the room where they are dropped. items are lost (discard the card).searching apart from the character-dedicated items, there are 4 colors of items: red (military), yellow (technical), green (medical), blue (crafted). the red, yellow, and green decks contain items which can be found in rooms when using a search action. the color of any item found during a search action should match the color of the searched room (the background color under its name and rule text). when searching in a white room, the player can choose to draw from any of these 3 decks. each time a character performs a search action in a room, reduce the room’s item counter by 1. when the item counter reaches 0, the room has been emptied and cannot be searched anymore. crafting blue deck item cards are crafted items which can be assembled out of other items you have. you may look through this deck at any time. a crafted item cannot be built if its card is not available, even if you have the required blue components. to build a crafted item, perform a craft item basic action and discard 2 item cards showing the blue component symbols corresponding to the grey components symbols of the crafted item you want to build. then draw the desired crafted item card from the deck. quest items once the requirement of one of your quest cards is fulfilled, it is flipped faceup on its vertical side and becomes a normal item card. player goals and game end to win, you must fulfill the objective on your objective card and survive by either hibernating with the ship still functioning and jumping to earth or using an escape pod to evacuate the ship. if you use an escape pod, hibernate or die, you can no longer participate in the game (however if you were the first to die you may continue the game as an intruder). at the end of the game, only characters that are still alive determine if their objectives have been met and if they have won or not. the game ends when one of these conditions is met: a. the time marker reaches the red space of the time track. the ship jumps into hyperspace: all characters on board who are not in hibernation die. the intruders survive. b. the self-destruct marker reaches the red space of the self- destruct track or you must place a 9th fire marker or a 9th malfunction marker. the ship explodes: all characters on board (awake and in hibernation) and all intruders die. c. the last alive, non-hibernating character on the ship dies, hibernates or uses an escape pod. if the self-destruct sequence was active, move its marker to the red space. if not, move the time marker to the red space. resolve the effects of those markers as described above. if one of the conditions above is met and at least 1 character survived (either asleep in the hibernatorium or evacuated in an escape pod), go to the victory check step.victory check 1. engines check if the ship survived up to this moment, reveal the top engine tokens of each of the 3 engines. if 2 or 3 of the top engine tokens have a damaged status, the ship explodes and all the hibernating characters and all intruders die. a malfunction marker in the engine room only disables the room action. a working engine is not damaged even if there is a malfunction marker there. 2. coordinates check if the ship survived up to this moment, reveal the coordinates card and check the current space of the destination marker. if the ship is not headed toward earth, all characters asleep in the hibernatorium die. the intruders survive. the quarantine objective requires another jump destination (mars) and is the exception: any character with this objective does not die if they are asleep in the hibernatorium and the ship’s destination is mars. in any case, the ship is not destroyed. 3. contamination check each alive character (either asleep in the hibernatorium or evacuated in an escape pod) scans their contamination cards. a. if there is a larva on your character board, skip this step. scan all the contamination cards in your action deck, discard pile, and hand. b. if there is at least 1 infected card, shuffle all your cards (both action and contamination) to create a new action deck, then draw the 4 top cards. if you draw at least 1 contamination card (infected or not), you die. if there are none, they survive. 4. objective check if there are any characters still alive, each of them reveals their objective card to the other players and checks to see if they have met all its requirements. objectives player x’s character cannot survive: your character cannot be alive at the end of the game (they cannot hibernate or escape using an escape pod). your character is the only survivor: no character but yours may survive the game. sending the signal: you must locate the comms room and perform its room action. the ship must reach earth/mars: the ship will reach its destination if the right coordinates have been set in the cockpit and if at least 2 of its 3 engines are still working. discover a weakness: weaknesses can be discovered by bringing an object to the laboratory and performing the laboratory room action. it doesn’t matter who does the research, as long as the weakness has been discovered at the end of the game. intruder eggs may be found in the nest. destroy the nest: the nest is destroyed when there are no intruder eggs left in it. to destroy eggs, see the nest room. solo & cooperative mode solo mode this mode has its own solo/coop objectives deck. at the start of the game, draw 2 cards from this deck (instead of the regular objective cards). once the first encounter occurs, you must choose 1 of these 2 objective cards. the number of items available in each room is reduced by half, rounding up. to win, you must fulfill your objective and survive. fully cooperative mode this mode has its own solo/coop objectives deck. at the start of the game, draw 1 card per player (instead of the regular objective cards). to win the game, all these objectives must be fulfilled and at least 1 character must survive. if there is 1 card requiring you to send the signal, only 1 character must fulfil it. if there are 2 or more such requirements, that many characters must send the signal. the emergency room allows the crew to revive any near-death character. when a character dies, another character may pick up their corpse token and carry it to the working emergency room. a player whose corpse is in the emergency room places their character miniature there at the start of the next round. all their light wounds are discarded and all their serious wounds are dressed. the emergency room does not work if there’s an intruder or a malfunction token in it.playing as an intruder this optional mode allows the first player whose character dies to continue playing the game by controlling the intruders (and slightly increases the difficulty level for the rest of the players). if 2 characters die simultaneously, the player with the lower player number gets to control them. the player controlling the intruders removes all their former character’s components from the game, then shuffles the intruder player action deck and place it in front of them. finish the current turn according to the standard rules. any changes are applied only at the start of the next player phase. turn sequence player phase 1. draw action cards: the intruder player draws 3 cards (their hand limit is 4 cards). 2. first player token: the intruder player is omitted during this phase (they never take the first player token). 3. player rounds: the intruder player follows the standard order of play for playing their rounds, but they can only take 1 action (by playing a card from their hand) or pass. when passing, the intruder player may choose to keep 1 card from their hand and discard the rest. during their round, the intruder player can play an intruder action card in 1 of these 3 ways: 1. move: move any intruder through a corridor with a number matching the one printed on the intruder action card. if the intruder moves to a technical corridor, proceed according to the normal rules. 2. attack: choose any intruder in the same room as a character. the intruder attacks that character, following the normal rules, with one exception: the intruder player draws a number of intruder attack cards equal to the number displayed on the player intruder card played this round. then, they choose 1 of these cards to be resolved and put all the others at the bottom of the intruder attack deck. 3. effect: resolve the effect on the intruder action card. event phase almost all of the entire event phase is omitted, with the exception of the time track and fire damage. all the other steps do not apply in this mode: intruders do not attack at the end of the turn (but they still make surprise attacks during encounters or when characters escape from rooms with intruders). event cards are not used unless as a result of intruder player action card effects. there is no intruder bag development step. victory condition the player controlling the intruders cannot win the game; their goal is to ensure that no other players win."

(if capital ever exceeds 39, flips the token to the 40 side and start again from space 0 of the capital track.) each player draws the number and types of action cards listed on their corp sheet. take the rival cards displaying the corporations being used by players, as well as the federalist rival card, and shuffle them together, returning unused rival cards to the box. then, deal one rival card facedown to each player; the remaining rival card is placed partially under the board. each player secretly looks at their rival card, but cannot share this information. each player draws 2 investment cards from the investment deck, places one facedown in their play area, and returns the remaining card facedown to the top of the investment deck. separate the android (there are only 3 android tokens used; the 4th is a replacement), outage, unrest, illness, and development tokens as well as the human first, orgcrime, and prisec units into piles by type near the board to create the reserve. the city consists of 10 districts, each with a unique name and number. each district belongs to one of 3 tiers, represented by a colored border and a number of bars under the district’s name. each district produces 1 or 2 types of resources in the amounts indicated below their icons. the leftmost resource listed in a district, its icon framed by a colored circle, is the primary resource. if there is another resource, it is the secondary resource. playing the game 1 . action phase the active player resolves a turn consisting of the following steps. players repeat these steps until there are no asset cards remaining on the turn track at the end of a player’s turn, when the action phase ends and play proceeds to the production phase. 1. refresh ready all your exhausted asset cards. then, in the order listed, draw the number and types of actions cards indicated on your corp sheet. construction (green) repair outages and build valuable developments. biotech (red) mitigate threat by containing illnesses and manipulating the event deck. labor (purple) relocate android tokens and can quickly produce specific resources. media (yellow) reduce unrest and allow players to draw extra cards. security (blue) place protective prisec units on the board and destroy enemy units. if you draw general action cards, you can draw them from any action card type you have not already drawn this step. you cannot look at the cards you are drawing before choosing a deck. 2. resolve deal the players collectively resolve a deal. 3. end of turn you may resolve any of your asset card abilities with the end of turn header, in an order of your choice. then, if the number of action cards in your hand exceeds your hand size, discard action cards until you do not exceed your hand size. then pass the active player token to the player to your left.2 . production phase the 3 districts that contain an android token are exploited and produce their resources. track this by moving the resource tokens in the supply to reflect how much of each resource has been produced. energy entertainment consumables credits tech next, the exploited district’s unrest increases, even if it failed to produce anything. place an unrest token with the yellow protest side faceup in that district’s condition box. if the district already has an unrest token, flip the token to the red strike side. if the strike side is already faceup, it remains faceup. strike: a district in strike cannot produce any resources. outage: a district in outage cannot produce any resources. orgcrime unit: a district with an orgcrime unit cannot produce its primary resource. development: the value of the primary resource in the district is increased by one. 3 . event phase resolve the top card of the event deck from top to bottom. the bottom half indicates which units and tokens are placed on the board; one copy of each component is placed in each district listed next to that component. a district cannot have more than one copy of any enemy unit, outage token, or illness token. if a second copy must be placed, it moves to the next district instead. the number in the lower-right corner of an event card indicates the number of turns for the next action phase. players reset the turn track by taking that number of asset cards from the top of the asset deck and placing one of them facedown below each slot of the turn track, starting with the lowest-numbered slot. finally, move the round track token to the next space on the round track. if the token moves to a numbered space, players resolve another standard round starting with the action phase; the new active player takes the first turn. if the token moves to a demand space, players resolve a demand round. deals during the action phase of each turn, the players resolve a deal by following these steps: 1. asset the active player reveals the rightmost asset card on the turn track (the card with the highest-numbered slot) and places it faceup in the revealed asset box of the board.2. main offer the active player must propose their main offer by placing either 1 action card from their hand or their emergency action card faceup in the main offer box of the board. 3. counteroffer starting with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, each player (excluding the active player) has one chance to either propose a counteroffer or pass. to propose a counteroffer, place either 1 action card from your hand or your emergency action card faceup in the counteroffer box of the board. to propose a counteroffer, you must discard a number of cards from your hand equal to the number of faceup cards in the counteroffer box (i.e., the first countering player does not discard any cards, the second must discard one card, etc.). when you propose a counteroffer, you become the countering player. the previous countering player and counteroffer cease to be the countering player and counteroffer. 4. support all players except the active player and the countering player become supporting players. starting with the supporting player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, each supporting player may either support or abstain. to support, place 1 or more cards from your hand facedown next to either the main offer or the counteroffer. you cannot support both offers. 5. resolution the player with the most facedown cards next to their offer wins the deal. they resolve the effect on their offer. then, they claim the revealed asset. all action cards played during the deal are discarded facedown to the shared discard pile. if the main offer and counteroffer are tied for support, the active player wins the deal. emergency action cards are returned to their original owners. if the card was the winning offer, it is returned facedown; otherwise, it is returned faceup. demand round there are 3 demand rounds during the game. during a demand round, resolve the following steps in order: 1. score investment each player reveals their facedown investment card and gains capital as instructed by that card. 2. pay demand players collectively pay the demand established by the revealed demand card. if each resource in the supply equals or exceeds the amount indicated on the demand card for that resource, the demand is met, and threat does not increase. if at least 1 resource in the supply is less than the amount indicated, the demand is not met, and threat increases by the amount indicated on the demand card. the game immediately ends after this step during the third demand round.3. reveal demand reset each resource token by placing it on the 0 space of its resource track (the icon space). place the revealed demand card at the bottom of the demand deck. reveal the top card of the demand deck, and place 1 target token on each resource track on the numbered space that matches the number next to that resource on the demand card. 4. choose investment return all investment cards to the investment deck and shuffle the deck. then, each player draws 2 investment cards and chooses one to keep facedown in their play area. return the remaining investment cards facedown to the top of the investment deck. district components human first unit (enemy unit) when a district with a human first unit is exploited, unrest there increases by 2 stages instead of one. if unrest cannot increase by 2 stages because the district is in protest, strike, or outage, place an outage token in that district. if the district was already in outage, the new outage token moves. only human first units can cause an outage token to be placed due to unrest being unable to increase. orgcrime unit (enemy unit) a district with an orgcrime unit cannot produce its primary resource (even if the district has a development token). prisec unit when an enemy unit is placed or moved into a district containing a prisec unit (or vice versa), that enemy unit must move. a district cannot contain more than 1 prisec unit. outages a district in outage cannot produce any resources. when an outage token is placed in a district, it removes any unrest token there, returning its unrest to stable. this does not trigger nbn’s contract. unrest cannot increase in a district in outage. only human first units can cause an outage token to be placed due to unrest being unable to increase. unrest there are 3 stages of unrest in a district: stable, protest, and strike. when a district’s unrest increases from stable to protest, place an unrest token in that district’s condition box with the protest side visible. when unrest increases from protest to strike, flip that token to its strike side. unrest decreases in reverse order. when a district is exploited, its unrest increases by 1 stage. unrest cannot increase in a district that is already in strike. unrest cannot decrease in a stable district. when unrest increases in a district in strike, an outage token is not placed unless the district was being exploited and contained a human first unit. when an outage token is placed in a district, any unrest token in that district is returned to the reserve. this does not trigger nbn’s contract. a district in outage is treated as a stable district. unrest cannot increase in a district in outage. when an effect removes an outage token from a district, that district’s unrest is stable. illness when an action card is resolved, if it involves one or more districts that have an illness token, increase threat by 2. a district is involved in the resolution of an action card if any unit or token is placed into or removed from that district. it is also involved if a unit or token moves into or out of that district, or if that district was chosen as part of an action card’s effect. threat does not increase when a district with an illness token is exploited. android tokens when an android token is moved, it can be moved to any district, ignoring movement paths. when multiple android tokens are moved, they are moved one at time and cannot be moved to a district that already has an android token. a district cannot have more than 1 android token. developments while a district contains a development token, the quantity of its primary resource is increased by one. a district cannot have more than 1 development token. if a district has only 1 resource type, that resource is the primary resource; it does not have a secondary resource. a district cannot have more than 1 development token. movement a district cannot have more than one copy of an outage token, illness token, and each enemy unit. if any of these components are placed in a district that already has a copy of that component, the component must move. additionally, when an enemy unit and a prisec unit occupy the same district, that enemy unit must immediately move. each district has one exiting movement path that points to another district. to move a component, place it in the district pointed to by the exiting movement path. if the next district also already has a copy of that component, it moves again. this process continues until the component moves to a district that does not already contain a copy of it, or until it moves into the root (the red circle). when an enemy unit is placed or moved into a district containing a prisec unit (or vice versa), that enemy unit must move. if an enemy unit, outage token, or illness token moves into the root, it is returned to the reserve and threat is increased by 2. this does not count as being removed from a district, so no corp sheet contracts are triggered. corp sheet contracts the contract on your corp sheet provides capital to your corporation when the described condition is met while resolving an action card (regardless of which player resolved the action). if a condition requires a component to be removed from a district, removing a component from the root does not satisfy that condition. assets when you claim an asset, place it faceup next to your corp sheet. you can use asset card abilities as described on the cards. if you have any assets with the end of turn header, you can use each once at the end of each of your turns. some assets must be exhausted to resolve their effects: rotate the card 90º clockwise. an exhausted card cannot be exhausted again. you ready your asset cards at the start of your turn by rotating them 90º counterclockwise. some assets must be discarded to resolve their effects: place them at the botttom of the asset deck. some asset card abilities allow players to steal capital and cards from other players. when capital is stolen from a player, that player loses an amount of capital indicated by the ability, and the player who stole the capital gains that amount of capital. when a player steals an exhausted asset card, it remains exhausted. the player who stole the asset does not count as claiming that asset for the purpose of resolving its effect. an ability that steals action cards cannot steal emergency action cards. emergency action cards can only be stolen by abilities that explicitly allow them to be stolen. emergency actions each player starts the game with their corporation’s matching emergency action card. these are not part of your hand of action cards; they are kept faceup next to your corp sheet. emergency action cards can be proposed as offers just like normal action cards. instead of being discarded, however, a proposed emergency action card is returned to the player with the matching corporation. if the card was the winning offer for the deal, it is returned facedown and cannot be used again unless a card effect flips it faceup. if the card was not the winning offer, it is returned faceup and can be used again.discards all action cards are discarded facedown to a single discard pile next to the lower right slot on the board with the garbage can icon. when you must draw an action card but no cards remain in that deck, the cards in the discard pile are shuffled, sorted by type, and then shuffled into their respective decks. actions cards are always discarded facedown. you cannot look at facedown cards when they are discarded, nor while they are in the discard pile. trading players may influence other players via any means necessary. they can give or trade their capital and assets to gain support during a deal, to encourage certain actions to be played, to swap assets, etc. all promises made concerning the future are non-binding— players can make promises and not fulfill them. however, if both players can immediately and completely fulfill the terms of the trade, they must do so. players cannot trade action cards, emergency action cards, investment cards, rival cards, or corp sheets. the federalist the player who is dealt the federalist rival card is the federalist. the federalist does not win the game like the other players. instead, they win the game when the threat token reaches 25, but only if they have at least 25 capital at that time. if they do not have 25 capital at that time, they lose the game along with the other players. the game will not have a federalist if the federalist rival card is the card placed under the board during setup instead of being dealt. winning and losing the game ends after the pay demand step of the third demand round, or when the threat token reaches space 25 of the threat track. if the game ends during the third demand round, all players reveal their rival cards and the federalist loses the game. each remaining player who completes one of the following 2 conditions wins the game: a. if your rival card lists another corporation, you must have more capital than your rival. if you have the same amount, you do not have more capital and lose the game. b. if your rival card lists your own corporation, you must have more capital than 3 other players (2 other players if playing a 4-player game). if you do not have more due to a tie, you lose the game. if the game ends because threat reaches 25, all players reveal their rival cards. all players except the federalist lose the game. the federalist wins the game if they have at least 25 capital; otherwise, they lose the game along with the other players.

cost in rubium tokens listed on the reference sheet. spent rubium goes to the bank. players are limited by the number of figures available, but when units are destroyed they are returned to the supply and may be purchased again.play start-of-turn energize cards this is the only time these cards may be played. discard them face up next to the energize deck. 2. move each unit may move 1 hex. if a unit has the ability to move more than one hex, it must stop when entering a hex which contains enemy units (unless its ability says otherwise). if a turn finishes and the other player finds a unit on a space it cannot enter, it must be moved back to one of its home base hexes. retreating a unit beginning the turn in a contested space (ie. more than one player has units there) may retreat from that space, but must end its move in an empty space or a space the player controls (ie. he is the only player with units there). dragon breath at the end of the movement phase, if the player has a rubium dragon on the board in a hex he controls, it can breathe plasma into an adjacent space. announce the target space and roll a die. on a 4+, the player with units in that space chooses one to remove from the board. if more than one player has units in that space, choose which of the players takes the casualty after the roll. this special attack isn’t considered a battle: if it succeeds, the player can’t play a win a battle mission or secret mission card, and can’t use energize battle cards to affect the result. if his opponent loses his only unit in the target space, he doesn’t draw an energize card, and he doesn’t get to counterattack the dragon. 3. explore if a unit ends its movement on a space with a face-down exploration tile, the tile is flipped face up. if the tile shows a unit, put one of those units from the supply on that space. on the player’s next turn he can move and battle with it. if the tile shows a mine, put one of those mine markers permanently on that space. if the tile shows a unit and a mine, get both. once an exploration tile has been flipped over it is removed from the game.4. fight a player conducts one round of battle in each contested hex where he has units. order of battle units attack in an order of battle, from right to left on each reference chart. when a unit type comes up in the order, both attacker and defender simultaneously make an attack roll for each unit they have of that type. to succeed on an attack roll, roll equal to or higher than the hits on number listed for that unit. for each successful attack roll, the opponent chooses one of his units on that space to be destroyed. if the unit hasn’t attacked yet it no longer has the opportunity. once each unit has attacked in order, the battle in that space ends for the turn, even if units remain. in cases when more than one opponent has units in a space, choose one to be the defender. only the attacker and the defending player then participate in the battle. the player whose turn it is always makes decisions first, such as deciding which casualties to remove or whether to play an energize battle card. results of battle a player wins a battle if he attacks on his turn and eliminates all the defender’s units in a space. a player loses a battle if all of his units in a space are destroyed. if it’s another player’s turn when losing a battle, draw 1 energize card. if a player loses on his own turn, he does not draw an energize card, and the defender can’t play a mission card. neither player wins or loses if both have units remaining at the end of battle.

energize battle cards energize battle cards may be played during a battle if the text applies. any player may play energize battle cards, even those not involved in the battle. the attacker goes first in playing energize battle cards, then the defender, then clockwise from the defender. secret mission and mission cards many secret mission cards and all mission cards are playable when a player wins a battle. for each battle won, a player can play only one card that has the victory point total listed in red. mission cards can be played whenever you win a battle as long as you don’t play a secret mission card for winning that battle. a player can only play a secret mission or mission card on his turn, as soon as he accomplishes the goal listed on the card. the card is put face up in front of the player where it remains for the rest of the game. each secret mission and mission card notes how many victory points (vps) the player earns when he accomplishes that mission.winning the game the game ends immediately when either of the following happens: a player earns a total of at least 12 victory points worth of mission and secret mission cards. play to 10 vps for a shorter game or 14 vps for a longer game. a player is eliminated from the game. a player is eliminated if his last unit is destroyed, he doesn’t have enough rubium to purchase any more units, and he doesn’t have any cards to discard for rubium. the player with the highest vp total among the remaining players wins the game. in case of a tie, the tied player controlling the most spaces wins. if there’s still a tie, the tied player with the most units on the board wins. finally, if there’s still a tie, the game is a draw.team rules set up the game for a 4-player game and split into two 2-player teams, with partners sitting across from each other. the first team to reach a combined total of 20 vp wins. at the end of a player’s turn, his partner may pass any one card to him face down. if a player moves into a hex with any number of his partner’s units, there is no battle, but the hex is still considered contested (eg. neither player draws rubium from a mine there). units may move through a hex containing partner’s units as long as there are no opponent’s units there. all discussion must be public, and a card shown to a partner must be shown to all players (not including the card passed at the end of a turn). if a player is eliminated, his partner may continue to play for victory, still counting their combined vp total."

faceup on each clan house as its sentry. take the 2 and 4 value taira (red) and the 2 and 4 value minamoto (blue) clan tokens and place them on different clan houses. then place the 6 value go-shirakawa (green) token on the remaining house. the rest of the clan tokens go in a pile next to the board. mix up the treasure tokens in the bag and place 3 treasures in each house, red side facedown. treasures discarded during the game are kept in a pile off the board; if you exhaust the treasures in the bag, put the discards back in. take the 3 hensojutsu (disguise) skill tiles, shuffle them, and place them in a small facedown stack off the board next to the sensei area. shuffle the rest of the tiles and place them in a large facedown stack next to the hensojutsu tiles. draw a number of skill tiles equal to the number of players from this stack and place them faceup in the sensei area. shuffle the envoy cards and place 4 faceup off the board near the palace, next to the remaining cards in a facedown deck. shuffle the rumor cards and place 4 faceup off the board near the pavilion, next to the remaining cards in a facedown deck. shuffle the dojo cards and deal 4 to each player. place 3 dojo cards faceup off the board near the dojo, next to the remaining cards in a facedown deck. rumor cards and dojo cards are the only hidden player information in the game. place the white round marker on space 1 of the round track.playing the game in turn order, each player places 1 shuriken on a location and immediately follows that location’s rules. once all players have placed 3 shuriken, the round is over. the game lasts 7 rounds. the dojo place a shuriken here and take dojo cards in any combination from the faceup cards or the deck. if you have no dojo cards, take 4 cards. if you have 1 dojo card, take 3 cards. if you have 2 or more dojo cards, take 2 cards. then replace any faceup cards taken with new cards from the deck. if there are no more cards in the deck, shuffle the discards and start a new pile. if you have over 7 dojo cards in hand, you must discard down to 7. always stack your shuriken on top of any previously placed shuriken. at the end of the round, the stack determines player order in the next round: the player with the topmost shuriken goes first, and so on down through the stack. if a player placed more than 1 shuriken, only his top one counts for the next round’s player order. the clan houses you invade houses to earn treasure. each treasure is protected by a guard: the sentry is the guard that is faceup; the others will be surprises. strength or stealth to start your attack, place a shuriken on the strength or stealth side of a house. strength: you must play a dojo card that is higher in value than the guard. ties do not win. stealth: you must play a dojo card that is lower in value than the guard. ties do not win. a 3 dojo card may be played like a normal dojo card. it may also be played along with another dojo card as a kicker—giving +1 or -1 to the other card. you may play multiple kickers on the same card.treasures treasures have a value of 2-5 honor. gold’s value is variable, but it is considered the most valuable treasure. defeating guards each time you defeat a guard, put one of the treasures in the house on your shuriken. take plain treasures first, from least valuable on up, then red treasures, from least valuable on up. then decide whether to leave, or take on the next guard (to get another treasure). to leave, take all treasures from your shuriken. remaining treasures are left in the house. to take on the next guard, call banzai. another player then turns up another guard card. if the next treasure token available is plain side up, he draws a normal guard. if the token is red side up, he draws an elite guard. if an elite guard card depicts 2 guards, they must both be defeated separately. if you cannot defeat this guard, you fail and take only 1 treasure from your shuriken, discarding any other treasures on it. after being defeated, normal guard cards are discarded. defeated elite guards are kept by the player who beat them and are scored at the end of the game. if you fail or decide to leave, after resolving the treasure on your shuriken, add 1 treasure to the house, plain side up. leave the faceup sentry on the house (he recovers). the house may be invaded again this round by any player. alarm guards when a guard with an alarm is turned up, immediately draw 1 treasure from the bag and place it plain side up in the house. then select the most valuable plain side up treasure in the house and flip it to the red side. ignore alarms on sentry guards. defeating all the guards if you defeat all guards in a house, take all of the treasure and replace the clan honor token with any token of a different clan. the house is left empty of treasure until the end of the round; no one may place shuriken there.the sensei place a shuriken here and select a skill of any style (snake, tiger, crane) by discarding the dojo card shown on the skill tile. take the skill and place it faceup in front of you. ? means that you may discard any dojo card. once you learn a skill of a certain style, you do not have to discard a dojo card to buy more skills of that style. you may use a skill only once per round (turn the tile facedown). if you learn the same skill twice, you may use each skill tile once per round. the palace place a shuriken here to bribe one envoy. take one of the faceup envoy cards by discarding the required treasures and immediately scoring their value in honor. take the envoy and place it faceup in front of you. single icons indicate that those specific treasures are required. all 4 treasure icons means ‘of any type of treasure’ and may therefore score varying honor. gold may be substituted as any treasure you choose, scoring as that treasure. the pavilion place a shuriken here to spread one favorable rumor. choose one of the faceup rumor cards by discarding the required treasures and immediately scoring their value in honor. take the rumor and place it facedown in front of you. single icons indicate that those specific treasures are required. all 4 treasure icons means ‘of any type of treasure’ and may therefore score varying honor. gold may be substituted as any treasure you choose, scoring as that treasure. ending a round at the end of each round, do the following: 1. move player order markers the dojo shuriken stack determines the player order in the next round. the player with the topmost shuriken goes first, and so on down through the stack. players who didn’t place shuriken in the dojo do not change position relative to one another. afterward determining the player order, players take back their shuriken.2. reset skills all players turn their skills tiles faceup. 3. reset the sensei discard any leftover faceup skills at the sensei. draw from the large stack skill tiles equal to the number of players and place them faceup. any skills left over in the large stack after round 4 are discarded. round 5 on, draw and place one hensojutsu (disguise) skill tile faceup from the small stack. 4. reset cleared houses if a house has no treasures (all guards there were defeated), draw and place 3 treasures plain side up on the house. then place a new guard on the house as the new sentry. if the sentry is an alarm guard, ignore the alarm (ie, do not add an additional treasure to the house for that alarm). 5. refill palace and pavilion if there are less than 4 envoys in the palace, draw faceup envoys until there are 4. do the same for the rumors in the pavilion. 6. scoring phases advance the round marker to the next round. after rounds 3, 5, and 7, perform a scoring phase as shown below. after round 7, the end of game bonus scoring follows the scoring phase. scoring phases after the 3rd, 5th, and 7th rounds, there is a scoring phase. each envoy in a clan counts as 1 influence in that clan. ties are won by the player with the oldest envoy in that clan. first, in player order, players with the hensojutsu (disguise) skill declare which envoy of theirs that they are targeting. you may only choose to target envoys with the icon. players are rewarded in the clan order shown on the round track. reward first place in total envoy influence for each clan in order, then second place for each clan in order. the player with the most envoy influence in a clan has a choice—either score the total honor on the clan’s houses (as shown on matching clan tokens on the houses) or get a free rumor card from the pavilion.after each first place player chooses, the second place player gets whatever the first player left. no treasure is used or scored for a free rumor. rumors are not scored until the end of the game. refill the pavilion with rumor cards after the scoring phase. end of game bonus scoring after the last round ends, following the last scoring phase, complete the end of game bonus scoring. 1. rumor bonus scoring most rumor cards act as a ‘multiplier’ for something else you collect (as indicated in the top left hand corner of the card). so if you have rumor cards of a type, you score an amount of honor equal to the number of cards/tiles indicated that you have collected, as follows: if you have 1 rumor card of the same type, the multiplier is x1. if you have 2 rumor cards of the same type, the multiplier is x2. if you have 3 rumors of the same type, the multiplier is x4. if you collect more than 3 rumors of the same type, you start a new ‘set’. dishonorable opponents dishonorable opponents cards have no multiplier. if you are the only player with this type of rumor card, each card scores 6 honor. if 2 players have this type of card, each card scores 4 honor for its owner. if 3 or more players have this type of card, each card scores 2 honor for its owner. 2. unused treasure bonus scoring you get 1 honor for each remaining treasure you have, no matter the type of treasure. 3. defeated elites bonus scoring for each elite guard you defeated during the game, you receive 1 or 2 honor as indicated on the elite guard card. winning the player with the most honor wins. in the event of a tie, the player with the most envoys wins. if there is still a tie, the player with the oldest envoy (in any clan) wins."

134,29602,OKKO: ERA OF THE ASAGIRI,2008,ASMODEE,2.241,83,"setup either choose a scenario or: compose bands with a budget of 16 zeni per player. build the game board with 4 tiles forming a square.each player rolls a d6: the highest roller is player a, the other, player b. deploy bands: player a picks a side of the board and deploys his characters in the first row of squares. player b does the same on his side. player a starts. gathering your band each character has a value in zeni on his profile card. each character has an alignment: demon hunters (red), evil creatures (black) or mercenaries (grey). you cannot have both evil creatures and demon hunters in your band. mercenaries may be hired by either of these bands. some characters are unique. you may only have 1 of a unique character in your band, but it is possible to have the same character in an opposing band. characters who aren’t unique may be recruited more than once. each band may only recruit a single civilian. a civilian grants an extra inspiration dice, but if he is disabled a chosen die is permanently lost. civilians follow the same rules as the other characters. equipment cards each equipment card has a value in zeni. they are included in the total budget of the band. unless stated otherwise, an equipment card may be given to any character at the beginning of the game. if the character is disabled, it is lost. some cards are permanent while others may only be used once per game (flip face down after use). each character may only have 1 equipment card. characters may not trade equipment between each other once the game has begun. order of pla y each turn consists of a player a phase followed by a player b phase. in each phase: 1. player rolls his inspiration dice. 2. activate characters one by one in order of choice and use inspiration dice. 3. choose which dice to put in reserve from unused inspiration dice 4. announce end of phase. characters can only be activated once per phase. each activated character may make 1 action and then 1 movement, or 1 movement and then 1 action.an activated character may make 1 of these actions: attack shoot test willpower to return to vigilant state use a skill with action in its description a character may not move or take an action during the opponent’s phase, but if involved in an opponent’s action, he can use inspiration dice in reserve to increase one of his stats or use a skill. inspiration dice a band always has 4 inspiration dice. the inspiration dice can be used to increase stats: 1 fire die adds +1 to a character’s attack value when he attacks. 1 earth die in reserve on a profile card adds +1 to a character’s defense value when the character is attacked, or the target of a ranged attack during the opponent’s playing phase. 1 water die adds +1 to a character’s willpower value when he tests his willpower. 1 air die adds +1 movement point when the character moves. during a single phase, a character cannot use more than 1 inspiration die per stat. an inspiration die bonus disappears as soon as it is used. the inspiration dice can be used to activate skills: to activate a skill associated with an element, an inspiration die with the appropriate element is used.used inspiration dice are set aside. the player will roll them again at the beginning of his next playing phase. inspiration dice can be put in reserve: at the end of a playing phase, the dice which were unused can be distributed between the band’s characters. to put an inspiration die in reserve, the player places the die (symbol rolled faceup) on the character’s profile card. only 1 inspiration die can be put in reserve per profile card. a reserved die can only be used by that character. an inspiration die in reserve can be used to increase a stat or to use a skill, and can be kept as such over multiple turns. a character can use a reserved inspiration die during the opponent’s phase in order to defend himself. at the beginning of his phase, a player can take back any or all inspiration dice put in reserve. an inspiration die in reserve is lost for the playing if the profile card on which it was reserved is turned over. inspiration die results which have neither been used, nor put in reserve, are lost. the player will re-roll them at the beginning of his next playing phase.skill s skills not associated with an element are automatic and do not require inspiration dice to be used. skills associated with an element are temporary and require an inspiration die to be used. a character can only use each skill once per playing phase. skill effects are detailed on the characters’ profile cards; these take precedence over the manual if there is a contradiction. skills that contain the word action must be used instead of an action. movement all characters can move when they are activated (this movement is not an action). their movement value is how many movement points (mps) they may spent to move. moving forward or diagonally into one of the 3 squares of one’s own control zone, or stay in place and make a quarter-turn: 1 mp. moving into any other adjacent square (sideways or backwards): 2 mp. enter a hindering or aquatic terrain square: +1 mp. a character may not enter a square of blocking terrain or one occupied by another character; move through a wall or off the game board (unless specified in the adventure); or enter a square if he doesn’t have the mps to do so. a character cannot move diagonally between 2 squares occupied by characters or blocking terrain. movement and control zones a character who enters an enemy’s control zone must stop – his movement is over for this phase and he can neither turn nor continue moving. he is free to attack or use an action skill if he hasn’t already taken an action. a shaken character who begins his movement in an enemy’s control zone can turn, but not move. a vigilant character who begins his movement in an enemy’s control zone can move normally, but becomes shaken at the end of his movement. terrain types clear terrain (eg. corridor, grassy area, stairs): no symbol. does not hinder movement, does not block los, and gives no cover against shooting. hindering terrain (eg. furniture, flora, ruins): hinders movement, does not block los, and gives cover against shooting. aquatic terrain (eg. small river, shallow pond): hinders movement, does not block los, and gives no cover against shooting. blocking terrain (eg. monument, big boulder): blocks movement and los. walls: red lines drawn between 2 squares. blocks movement and los.comb at attacking is an action and is only possible if the character has not taken another action during his activation. the character initiating combat is the attacker and uses his attack value; the character being attacked is the defender and uses his defense value. a character can only attack an enemy who is in his control zone. he is never forced to attack, but he must always defend if attacked. combat resolution 1. the active player declares which character attacks which enemy. 2. the attacker announces the inspiration dice and skills he will use for the attack. 3. the defender announces the inspiration dice and skills he will use to defend himself. 4. the defender turns (if necessary), so that the attacker is now in his control zone. 5. the attacker and defender each roll a d6 combat die. 6. the attacker adds together his attack value, the result of his combat roll and any bonuses. 7. the defender adds together his defense value, the result of his combat die and any bonuses. 8. whoever has the highest total wins the combat. if the combat is won with a difference of 1 or 2 points, the losing character retreats. if the combat is won with a difference of 3 points, the losing character becomes shaken and retreats. if the character had a die in reserve, it is lost. if the combat is won with a difference of 4+ points, the losing character is disabled and removed from the game. if the character had a die in reserve, it is lost. in case of a draw, the characters remain in contact. a defending character is also active – by winning a combat he could disable his opponent, make him retreat, or even put him in the shaken state. supporting characters characters may be in support in combat. they are not the ones attacking or being attacked, but as they have the enemy character in their control zone, they will influence the result of combat. during a combat, each friendly supporting character gives a +1 bonus to the combat die result. supporting characters are not affected by the result of combat. a character can benefit from support(s) in attack just as he can in defense. a character can support in multiple fights in a single phase. a character can both attack, and provide support in another fight, in the same phase.attacking from behind if the attacker makes all of his movement behind a line in front of and perpendicular to the defender’s facing, the defender is surprised. the attacker adds +1 to his combat die result as a bonus for attacking from behind. regardless of whether a defender is attacked from behind or not, he gets a free turn so that the attacker now faces him (ie, the attacker is now in his control zone). shooting shooting is an action, and is only possible if the character has not taken another action during his activation. the character making the ranged attack is the shooter. the person he is aiming at is the target. to shoot, a character must use a ranged attack skill, indicated by the shot descriptor. range and value of the shot is as described. the target uses his defense value. the shooter must not be in an enemy’s control zone, the target must be in the shooter’s field of vision (all squares on the other side of a line in front of and perpendicular to his facing) and in range, and los must not be blocked. line of sight (los) the los is an imaginary line between the center of the shooter’s square and the center of the target’s square. los is blocked by walls, blocking terrain squares and squares containing characters other than the target. a los going diagonally between two occupied squares or blocking terrain squares is considered blocked. each hindering terrain square crossed by the los adds +1 to the target’s die roll (ignore a square of hindering terrain the shooter is occupying). a los going diagonally between 2 hindering terrain squares also adds +1 to the target’s die roll. range the range of a ranged attack is expressed in squares. to shoot, the target must be in the weapon’s range. shooting resolution 1. the player announces which character is shooting at whom. 2. the shooter announces which inspiration dice and skills he is using to shoot at the target. 3. the target announces which inspiration dice and skills he will use to defend against the ranged attack. 4. the shooting character rolls a d6 and adds his shooting value and any bonuses. 5. the target rolls a d6 and adds his defense value and any bonuses. 6. if the shooter wins by 1 or 2 points, the target turns around (if necessary) to have the shooter in his field of vision, then retreats. if the shooter wins by 3 points, the target turns around (if necessary) to have the shooter in his field of vision, then becomes shaken and retreats. if the target had a die in reserve, the die is lost. if the shooter wins by 4+ points, the target is disabled and removed from the game. in any other case, the shot has no effect and the target does not turn around. retreat retreating is a mandatory movement. a character forced to retreat must retreat into his retreat zone. he selects a square from the 3 possible retreat squares behind him, and does not change his facing. a character who is forced to retreat, but is unable to do so automatically becomes shaken. if forced to retreat into aquatic or hindering terrain he automatically becomes shaken if he is in aquatic or hindering terrain and is forced to retreat into clear terrain, he does not become shaken. a character who is forced to retreat into an enemy’s control zone automatically becomes shaken. a shaken character who becomes shaken again because of a difficult or impossible retreat is disabled. vigilant/shaken each profile card has two sides:a blue side, showing the character in a vigilant state. a red side, showing the character when shaken. a vigilant character who becomes shaken turns his profile card over, red side up. if he had an inspiration die in reserve, it is lost. a character who is shaken, and for some reason becomes shaken again is disabled and removed from the game. a shaken character who wants to become vigilant again must succeed at a willpower test. this is an action. if the test is successful, the card is turned blue side up. if he had an inspiration die in reserve, the die is lost. if the test fails, the character stays shaken. in any case, the character has taken his action and cannot do anything more during his activation. a character who is shaken cannot become vigilant again if he is in an enemy’s control zone. testing willpower a character testing his willpower rolls a d6 and must roll lower than or equal to his willpower stat. he may use an appropriate skill or use a water die to add +1 to his willpower value. testing your willpower to return to a vigilant state is an action. testing your willpower in other circumstances (eg, to attack a fearsome foe or to resist magic), is not an action. winning the game the game ends as soon as a band has lost 12 zeni (add the value of the characters to that of their equipment). the band who inflicted the losses wins the game. if you are playing with a budget of 12 zeni, the game ends as soon as a band has lost 8 zeni."

it becomes a beast with a strength of 4 and loses all other abilities. it counts as a beast for determining war-torn and city limit. a unit cannot become enraged if it would cause you to exceed your city limit. at the end of your offering step, turn any of your facedown enraged units faceup. ending the game the game ends at the end of the active player’s turn if one of these conditions is met: 1. the opposing player has 5 facedown feat cards. 2. 2 or more cities have no reward cards. players then earn points as follows: • 2 points for each reward card in your hand. • 1 point for each facedown reward card in your area. • 2 points for each facedown feat card in your area. options and expansions: • 1 point for each hero card in your hand. • 1 point for each relic card in your area. • 3 points for each challenge card in your area. the player with the most points wins. on a tie, the player with the most facedown feat cards wins. optional units spirits a spirit has 2 abilities: when played into a city choose one to use. when you play the spirit’s invoke cost, discard it and use both abilities. spirits can never be enraged. heroes each hero’s ability notes when it can be used. they can be played to a city like a unit, but have a cost of 0. they may be discarded during the offering step.game setup remove the spirit and hero cards from the deck, shuffle the remaining unit cards and place them in a facedown deck with the coins beside them. each player takes 1 of each of the 6 feat cards and places them faceup in their play area. place the 3 city cards in the middle of the table. shuffle the reward cards and place 4 facedown on each city card. each player draws 4 unit cards and takes 4 coins and a reference card. the oldest player takes the first turn. if there are ever no cards left in the deck, shuffle the discards to form a new deck. emissary of war setup each player selects 1 unit card from their hand and places it facedown as their emissary. both are revealed: the player with the greatest combined cost, offering and strength is the first player of the game. on a tie, the emissary with the highest strength wins; on a further tie, the oldest player. the first player discards their emissary; their opponent returns their emissary to their hand. drafting in both variants all 66 unit cards are shuffled together and used. each player has their own deck and discard pile. unselected cards are returned to the box. during the game, any ability that references ‘the deck’ or ‘the discard pile’ refers to the player’s own deck or discard pile. draft variant 1: each player draws 3 cards, chooses 2, places them facedown and passes the remaining card to the other player. this continues until each player has 30 facedown cards. shuffle your cards to form your deck. draft variant 2: 20 random cards are placed faceup in the middle of the play area. alternating turns, each player selects 1 card until all have been selected. this is repeated 2 additional times, with each player selecting 30 cards. shuffle your cards to form your deck."
136,158109,ONWARD TO VENUS,2014,TREEFROG GAMES,2.5952,84,"setup lay out the 8 planets in a line with reasonable gaps between them; left to right: mercury, venus, earth and the moon equidistant in the next position (earth above the moon), mars, ganymede, titan, and finally the kuiper belt. each player selects a set of counters and player cards of the same colour: either the british empire (red), the french empire (blue), the russian empire (purple), the german empire (yellow), or the united states of america (green). there are 3 types of military units: infantry, spaceships and tanks. each player places 4 of their infantry and 2 of their spaceship counters in orbit around earth (close to the edge of the planet but not actually on it), and 1 of their factory counters on earth. during the game, carefully place your units so that it is clear which planet they are in orbit around. place the money to one side to form a bank. each player takes £12 from the bank. shuffle the game cards and deal 2 to each player. these are added to the 4 player cards (from now on treated as game cards) to form each player’s starting hand of 6 cards. place the remaining game cards facedown as the draw deck. place the pass card on the table, with pass cubes next to it. place all of the game tiles in the cloth bag. place the alien tiles to one side (these are only used if a crisis occurs in the kuiper belt). each player rolls all 3 dice. the highest roller takes the first player marker (re-roll ties between players). game play the game is played over 3 periods, each made up of 6 phases. complete each phase before moving on to the next. 1. place pass cubes place a number of pass cubes on the pass card equal to the number of players + 2. 2. draw and place game tiles randomly draw from the bag the number of tiles indicated by the number of game tiles per planet chart and place them faceup on each planet. game tiles already on a planet from the previous period remain there. remove any crisis tiles placed on ganymede. tiles that are removed from planets during the game are placed in a tile discard pile. 3. player actions starting with first player and proceeding in clockwise order, each player performs 1 action. this repeats until a player takes the last pass cube from the pass card. when it is your turn to perform an action you must choose one of the following:action: move military units you may move 1 group of your military units up to 2 planets. if you do not use your full movement allowance you may also perform a claim 1 tile action on the planet you just moved to. select a number of spaceship and infantry units as a group for movement, with at least 1 of them a spaceship. all of the units in this group must be in orbit around the same planet. the only military unit that can move between planets is the spaceship, but a spaceship can carry an unlimited number of infantry units with it. tanks cannot move between planets unless you play a card that states otherwise. after movement the group must all end up in orbit around the same destination planet. you cannot drop off or pick up units en-route; the group starts together and finishes together. you must work your way along the line of planets. earth and the moon are next to each other for the purposes of movement; moving from one to the other counts as 1 movement. if you claim a tile, this action does not necessarily have to involve one of the units that you moved (it could be a unit already in orbit around that planet). if you play a card that increases your movement allowance, that may allow you to claim a tile. action: claim 1 tile there are 2 general types of tiles you can claim: those without a defence value and those with a defence value. to claim a factory or mine tile you must have the corresponding counter available to you with which you can replace the tile. this rule also covers an attempt to take a tile from another player through the claiming of a tension tile. to claim an undefended tile from a planet, move one of your military units (infantry, spaceship or tank) from orbit down to the surface of that planet. take the tile from the planet and follow the associated rules: factory: place 1 of your factory counters on the surface of the planet you took the tile from, then discard the tile. draw 2 cards: draw 2 game cards from the deck and add them to your hand, then discard the tile. you can play cards in the same turn you draw them. your hand limit is 9. if you go over, discard down to 9 cards, placing the discarded cards on the discard pile. if the draw deck is exhausted, shuffle the discards to make a new deck. windfall: take £3 from the bank, then discard this tile. big game: keep this tile until the end of the game, when it gives you 1 vp. defended tiles have a defence value in the steel square in the bottom right-hand corner. all combat is carried out the same, irrelevant of what type of tile is being claimed. first determine the combat point (cp) cost of the tile you are attempting to claim: roll the 3 dice, and retain the 2 dice with the highest and lowest values (discard the middle value die). a result has a value of 0. calculate the difference between the 2 retained dice and add this value to the defence value of the tile.to claim the tile you must expend a number of combat points equal to or in excess of this cost: • each infantry or spaceship unit you move from orbit to the surface of the planet is worth 1 cp. • each tank you move from orbit to the surface is worth 2 cps. • you may play any number of game cards with cps on them. • you may play cards that modify the cp values of your military units. you decide exactly which military units and cards you wish to use to meet the cp cost. however, at least 1 military unit must move down to the surface of the planet (you cannot pay the cost with cards alone). if you are unable to meet the cp cost, or you decide that it is too high, the attempt fails and your turn ends. you are still subject to casualties. if you are able to expend sufficient cps, you claim the tile. the type of tile determines what you do next: mine: if you claimed a mine tile, take one of your mine counters and place it on the surface of the planet you took the tile from. then discard the tile. crisis: if you claimed a crisis tile, keep the tile until the end of the game, when it gives you 1 vp. tension: claiming a tension tile allows you to take control of a factory or mine belonging to another player on that planet. indicate which tile, then its defence value is calculated according to the military units the defender has in orbit and on the surface of the planet. infantry and spaceships have a defensive value of 1 each, while tanks are worth 2 points. then roll dice as normal, and add the difference to the defence value to find the tile’s cp cost. if you are able to pay this cost, you claim the tension tile. also remove the counter you decided to target (return it to the owning player) and replace it with one of your own of the same type. the tension tile is then discarded. casualties of combat only the active player can suffer casualties as a result of claiming a tile. for each die you rolled that shows the symbol you must select one of your military units to lose, which must be from where the combat is taking place. you lose any casualties after meeting the cost of combat. if you decided not to claim the tile you still must lose counters according to the results of your die roll. action: buy military units as an action you can buy 1 or 2 military units: infantry: £2 each. tanks: £3 each. spaceships: £4 each. built infantry units must be placed in orbit around earth. spaceships and tanks are built in orbit around any planet where you have at least 1 factory. you can always build spaceships and tanks in orbit around earth, even if you no longer have a factory there. you can build your units around different planets; they do not have to be placed in the same place. the number of pieces you have is a limit on what you can build. you cannot remove units from play to build them elsewhere.action: card action playing a card marked action counts as this action. place the card on the discard pile after resolving its effect. action: take 1 pass cube take 1 cube from the pass card, then draw 1 game card from the deck and add it to your hand. if you take the last pass cube from the card, also take the first player marker, making you the first player in the next period. the player actions phase now ends and play proceeds to the next phase. 4. crisis resolution if any of the crisis tiles in play is marked you must check to see if the crisis level on each such planet escalates. roll 3 dice and retain any . working from mercury to kuiper belt, place 1 of the retained dice on each crisis tile marked with a . if you still have dice left to assign then repeat the process, starting again from mercury. the crisis level on a planet is equal to the number of crisis tiles and dice on it. the order of crisis resolution is from mercury to kuiper belt. look up each planet in the crisis effects section of the rules and resolve the effect according to the crisis level. unless stated otherwise, crisis tiles remain on a planet after resolving effects. any dice assigned to planets are removed. 5. collect income all players now collect income for every mine and factory they have in play: mine: collect £3. factory: collect £2. 6. reset military units move any military units on the surface of a planet into orbit around that planet. now start a new period. ending the game the game ends after you have completed 3 periods. players calculate how many victory points (vps) they have scored. each planet awards victory points as indicated in the hexagons. the player with the highest income scores vps for first position, the player with the next highest income for 2nd position, and so on. on a tie the tied players score the same vps. score 1 vp for each big game tile and crisis tile gained during the game, and 2 vps for each alien tile. you do not score any victory points for military units or money. the player with the most vps is the winner.if there is a tie and one of the tied players has the first player marker then they take precedence. if there is still a tie then the player with the most mines and factories on the board is the winner. if there is still a tie after that then the player who gained the most victory points from big game, crisis and alien tiles is the winner. if that does not settle matters then the players share the victory."
137,303057,PAN AM,2020,FUNKO GAMES,2.4387,155,"setup place the board in the center of the table. put the 2 hangars (blue counter trays) next to the board by the planes (c) area. each event card has a round number. randomly select 1 card from each round, creating a deck of 7 cards in order from 1 to 7. place this deck facedown on the board in the event deck space, with the round 1 card on the top. return the unused event cards to the box. shuffle the destination deck and place it facedown in the destinations (b) area; then put 1 card faceup in each of the 4 destination spaces. shuffle the directive deck and place it facedown in the directives (e) area. place the pan am route markers, money, stocks, the pan am die, and the stock marker next to the board. place the cruiser and jet tiles in the planes (c) area, covering the matching top 2 areas. each player takes a player mat and these pieces in a matching color: planes: place 2 trimotor planes and 1 clipper plane on the fleet section of your player mat. place the rest of your planes in the appropriate hangars. income tracker: place this cube on the 0 spot for income on your player mat. when your income changes, move the income tracker to the new value. five airports: place these next to the airport (a) area. engineers: the number of engineers you take depends on the number of players in the game: 2 players = 5 each, 3 players = 4 each, 4 players = 3 each. return unused engineers to the box. each player draws 2 destination cards, 1 directive card, and takes $12. destination cards are faceup and visible to all, but keep directive cards hidden from opponents. the first player is the person who most recently flew on an airplane and takes the first player marker. round sequence the game is played in 7 rounds, each of which has 4 phases. at the end of the round, pass the first player marker to the next player in clockwise order. at the end of round 2 and round 5, remove the cruiser and jet tiles, respectively.1. event phase step 1: reveal reveal the next event card and put it on the space under the event deck. unless the card says otherwise, the event text is resolved immediately. step 2: stock price check the stock price on the event card and set the current stock price by placing/moving the stock marker on the stock price track: move the stock price up by one. move the stock price down by one. set the stock price to the indicated number. 2. engineer phase you assign engineers to the 5 areas on the board to determine the actions you take in the resolution phase. step 1: priority access skip the priority access step during the first round. assign engineers with priority access. engineers placed at the directives (e) area in the previous round have priority access. starting with the leftmost engineer on the directives (e) work site, assign each engineer to any space in areas a-d. step 2: assignment starting with the first player, players take turns in clockwise order assigning 1 engineer at a time to these 5 areas: a airports: place an airport in a city of your choice. b destinations: acquire a destination card. c planes: acquire an additional plane. d routes: claim a route with your airports, planes, and destination cards. e directives: draw a directive card (engineers placed here have priority access next round). you don’t resolve the action or pay any money for your bids until the resolution phase. if you cannot, or choose not to, assign an engineer, set it aside. you take back that engineer at the beginning of the next round. engineers overbid on a bidding track are reassigned in turn order. pass your turn if you have already assigned all your engineers. after players are done assigning engineers (it’s possible that not all engineers are assigned), proceed to the resolution phase. bidding tracks (a, b, c) each bidding track has 4 spaces indicating the cost you must pay in the resolution phase. you may assign your engineer to any space on an unoccupied track. if the track already has an engineer on it, your engineer must be placed on a higher spot and the first engineer is returned to its player.work sites (d, e) work sites are filled from left to right. engineers are placed in the space to the right of the previously placed engineer. 3. resolution phase resolve each engineer in order, starting with the airports (a) area and ending with the directives (e) area. if you can’t afford to pay your bid, you must sell stock. for each stock you sell, you earn the current stock price minus $2. if you can’t afford the bid after selling all your stock, you lose all your money and don’t gain the benefit of the action. any sold stock is returned to the supply. this is the only time you are allowed to sell stock. a. airports if your engineer is assigned here: • pay the cost of your bid to the supply. • take one of your airports from the supply and place it on any city that doesn’t already have an airport. if you don’t have any airports left in the supply, you may move one of your airports instead. • take back your engineer. • increase your income on your player mat by 1. you don’t earn income when you move an airport. b. destinations for each bidding track with an engineer: • pay the cost of your bid to the supply. • take the destination card and place it faceup next to your player mat. you also earn any bonus money on the card. • take back your engineer. after resolving all the engineers on all the destination spaces, put bonus money of $1 on all destination cards that remain. then refill any empty spots from the top of the destination deck. c. planes you always need a plane to claim a route. there are 4 bidding tracks at this area, one for each type of plane. jets and cruisers aren’t available to bid on until round 3 and round 6, respectively. for each bidding track with an engineer: • pay the cost of your bid to the supply. • take the plane you bid on and place it in your fleet on your player mat. if there are no planes of that range in your color remaining, you gain nothing but still spend the money on your bid. • take back your engineer. d. routes a route is a line between 2 cities with a diamond showing the distance. you must have an available plane with a range that matches or exceeds the distance of the route, and have landing rights at both cities, to claim a route. if you don’t have either, you can’t claim a route and your engineer’s action is wasted. there are 4 ways to get landing rights at a city: 1. having an airport of your color on the city. 2. having the city’s destination card (the card is not discarded). 3. discarding a destination card from the same region (color) as the city. this gives you landing rights long enough to claim just 1 route. 4. discarding 2 destination cards of the same region (color) that are different from the city’s region. this gives you landing rights long enough to claim just 1 route. resolve each engineer from left to right: • discard any destination cards required to get landing rights. • place a plane from your player mat on the route’s distance diamond. the plane must have a range that meets or exceeds the route’s distance (the number of lines on the tips of a plane’s wings is its range). • increase your income on your player mat by the distance of the route you claimed. • take back your engineer. e. directives the directives area provides you a directive card and gives your engineer priority access in the next round. resolve each engineer from left to right: • draw a directive card. look at the card, but keep it hidden from other players. • do not take back your engineer. this engineer has priority access and remains in this area until the next engineer phase. the bottom of each directive card indicates the phase (in black) and step (in red) in which you can play the card. you can play it any time during the indicated step. some directive cards must be played when resolving an engineer. play the card either directly before or after assigning the engineer. you can’t play the card if you don’t have an engineer assigned to the indicated area.4. pan am phase step 1: expansion pan am claims routes by expanding from miami (you may choose to have pan am expand out from rome instead). the current event card shows how many times the first player rolls the pan am die. if multiple rolls are indicated, resolve each one before rolling again. if one or more paths are rolled, follow each indicated path out from miami (or rome if starting from rome) until you find a route that is not claimed by pan am. if the route is unclaimed, claim it for pan am by putting a pan am route marker on it. if the route is claimed by a player, that player must sell the route to pan am. if the pan am symbol is rolled, pan am offers to buy routes from anywhere in the world. starting with the first player, each player may sell one route they own to pan am. this route does not need to be on one of pan am’s expansion paths. selling routes each time pan am buys a route from you: • you earn the route bonus in money. look up the route’s distance on the route bonus table on the board. .• replace your plane on the route with a pan am route marker. put the plane back in your fleet on your player mat. • reduce your income on your player mat by the distance of the route. once a route is claimed by pan am, it cannot be claimed for the rest of the game. step 2: income players earn income from their routes and airports. each player earns the amount of money indicated by their income tracker. if you need to recalculate your income, add the number of your airports on the board to the sum of the distances of your routes. step 3: stock players may buy stock in pan am. starting with the first player, each player may buy as much stock as they wish to pay for. the current stock price is indicated by the stock marker on the board.end of game the game ends after round 7. the player with the most stock in pan am wins the game. on a tie, the tied player with the most money wins. on a further tie, the tied players share the victory. other rules claim a free route some event and directive cards allow you to claim a free route. this means you don’t need landing rights at the 2 cities on the route; just place your plane onto the route’s distance diamond and increase your income on your player mat by the distance of the route you claimed. upgrade some event and directive cards allow you to upgrade a plane. to upgrade a plane, return it to the hangar and replace it with a plane that has a range exactly one higher. you can only upgrade planes that are currently in your fleet on your player mat. you can’t upgrade to a plane that is currently unavailable, either by having none remaining in the hangar or by having the plane’s bidding track covered by the cruiser or jet tiles."

(if there is a tie, randomly determine the virulent strain from among these tied diseases.) place the epidemic card next to that disease’s cube pile as a reminder. if you are also playing with the mutation or bio-terrorist challenge, the purple disease cannot be the virulent strain; ignore it when determining the virulent strain. virulent strain epidemic effects in addition to the normal epidemic effects, each virulent strain epidemic card has its own unique effect which applies to that disease only. some cards are marked with an icon indicating that they trigger a continuing effect; keep these cards faceup as reminders for the rest of the game. complex molecular structure a player would need to turn in 6 city cards of the virulent strain color to cure this disease, except for the scientist, who could turn in 5 cards, or the field operative, who could turn in 4 cards and 3 samples. government interference the effects of the event mobile hospital (when applied against virulent strain cubes in cities that a player is in or has entered) will negate the effects of government interference. the containment specialist’s power does not negate the effects of this card, nor do the events remote treatment or rapid vaccine deployment (unless all virulent strain cubes in the city in question are removed). the mutation challenge setup put the 12 purple cubes near the board. place the purple cure token vial-side up with the other 4 tokens. put the purple disease status tile on the board above the cures discovered area. immediately after dealing player cards to each player, but before adding the epidemic cards, shuffle the 3 mutation event cards face-down into the player draw pile. after determining the initial infections, put the 2 mutation cards on top of the infection discard pile. how the mutant (purple) disease spreads at game start, there is no purple disease on the board. once in play, the purple disease behaves just like other diseases, except as specifically described below.purple disease cubes enter play in 3 ways during the game: mutation cards if a mutation! card is drawn during the infection phase of a player’s turn, draw a city card from the bottom of the infection draw pile and place a purple cube in the depicted city. do not place a cube of the depicted city’s color in that city. drawing a mutation! card does count as one of the infection draws for that phase. the special event resilient population cannot be used to remove a mutation! card from the infection discard pile. mutation event cards if a mutation event card is drawn during the drawing cards phase of a player’s turn, follow the instructions on the mutation event card and then discard it. 2 of the 3 mutation event cards (the mutation spreads! and the mutation threatens!) require a card to be drawn from the bottom of the infection draw pile; when resolving them, do not place a cube of the depicted city’s color in that city. drawing a mutation event card does count as one of the card draws for that phase. if a player draws both a mutation event card and an epidemic card, resolve the mutation event card first (if a player draws 2 mutation event cards, then the player chooses which card to resolve first). infection phase during the infection phase, if an infection card is drawn for a city with at least 1 purple cube on it, add both 1 purple cube and 1 cube of the indicated color (unless that disease has been eradicated), resolving any outbreaks normally. curing the purple disease the purple disease can be cured if a player, for an action, discards 5 city cards (in any combination of colors) at a research station. at least one of these cards must depict a city which currently contains one or more purple cubes. the purple disease can be eradicated normally by treating all purple cubes on the board after curing the disease. if the purple disease is eradicated and a mutation! card is later drawn during the infection phase, discard it to the infection discard pile (without effect). this card still counts toward the number of infection cards drawn that phase. resolving epidemics and outbreaks conduct purple disease outbreaks normally. when drawing a card from the bottom of the infection draw pile to resolve step 2 of an epidemic, do not place a purple cube if one is already in the pictured city; just place 3 cubes of the indicated color normally. winning and losing the players win immediately by either: a. discovering cures to all 5 diseases or b. discovering cures for all 4 standard diseases and—at the same time or later—fully treating the purple disease (resulting in 0 purple cubes on the board). the players lose by all normal means, but also if there are no purple cubes in the supply when one is needed. there are only 12, not 24, purple cubes in the supply.the bio-terrorist challenge this challenge works with 3 or 4 players. one player is the bio-terrorist and takes the bio- terrorist role card, the black pawn (off-board at the start of the game), a location sheet, and a pencil. after placing initial cubes on the board, deal 2 infection cards face down from the infection draw pile to the bio-terrorist. the bio-terrorist draws and uses only infection cards, not player cards. after the board is setup and the first player is chosen, the bio-terrorist looks at his cards and decides which city he will begin the game in; secretly writing the city name in the starting city space of his location sheet. setup put the 12 purple cubes near the board. put the purple disease status tile on the board above the cures discovered area. place the purple cure token vial-side up with the other 4 tokens. use 2 event cards per player in the game, counting the bio-terrorist as a player for this purpose (only). sequence of play the bio-terrorist takes his turn after every player turn (after the infection phase). he does not draw cards (except by using actions) and does not perform an infection phase. bio-terrorist secrecy the bio-terrorist moves secretly about the board, keeping track of his moves and other actions on the location sheet. if at any time the bio-terrorist is in the same city as another player’s pawn, he is spotted and must place his pawn on the board. if he (or another player) later moves so that the bio-terrorist is alone in a city, he is hidden and removes his pawn from the board. when the bio-terrorist moves by direct or charter flight actions, he discards the used card faceup into the infection discard pile and announces that his pawn was sighted at that airport. he need not reveal if he used the card for a direct flight or a charter flight nor on which of his actions the flight took place. bio-terrorist a ctions on each of his turns, the bio-terrorist takes 2 of the following actions, plus 1 extra drive (or ferry) action (this extra action is optional and may be taken before, after, or in-between the other actions). basic actions the basic actions are available whether he is spotted or hidden. drive/ferry move to an adjacent city along a connecting red line.direct flight discard an infection card to move to the city pictured on the card. announce that the bio- terrorist has been sighted in the new city’s airport. charter flight discard the infection card matching your current city to move to any other city. announce that the bio-terrorist has been sighted in the old city’s airport. draw a card draw a card from the top of the infection draw pile to add to your hand. your hand limit is 7 cards; if you ever have more, immediately discard the excess to the infection discard pile (without effect). pass do nothing for 1 action. hidden actions these actions are available only while he is hidden. each may only be performed once per turn. infect locally place a purple cube in your current city, conducting any outbreaks as described below. infect remotely discard an infection card to place a purple cube in the pictured city (even if a player pawn is present there) conducting any outbreaks as described below. do not place a cube matching the color of the city pictured on the card. sabotage remove a research station from your current city, by discarding an infection card of matching color to this location. return the station to the supply. captured actions while captured, only these 3 actions are available (until he escapes). escape discard an infection card to escape via a direct flight (make sure to announce a sighting) to the pictured city. take the bio-terrorist pawn back from the player who captured it. draw a card same as the basic action. pass same as the basic action. capturing the bio-terrorist if the bio-terrorist’s pawn has been spotted and is on the board, a player in the same city as the bio-terrorist may, for an action, capture him. capture (special action) place the bio-terrorist’s pawn on your role card. he must immediately discard all cards in hand to the infection discard pile (without effect). while captured, the bio-terrorist can take only the draw a card, escape, or pass actions. (since he loses all cards in hand when captured, his first action after being captured will usually be to draw a card.) after performing an escape, he completes his turn normally. infecting cities containing purple cubes curing the purple disease if a player during the infection phase draws an infection card for a city that currently contains at least one purple cube, place both a purple cube and the indicated cube (resolving purple outbreaks as described below and any other outbreaks normally). epidemics: when drawing a card from the bottom of the infection draw pile to resolve step 2 of an epidemic, do not place a purple cube even if one is already in the pictured city; just place 3 cubes of the indicated color normally.purple “flare-out” outbreaks outbreaks of the purple disease (in the bio-terrorist challenge only) are so intense that they “flare out”, leaving the cities they break out from with just one purple cube. during a purple disease outbreak, first remove two purple cubes from the city (returning them to the supply) and then add a purple cube to each adjacent city. if a purple disease outbreak results in “chain reaction” outbreaks, do not add purple cubes back to those cities that have already had a purple outbreak while resolving these chain reaction outbreaks. this purple outbreak “flare-out” rule applies only to the bio-terrorist challenge, not to the mutation challenge. curing the purple disease the purple disease can be cured if a player, for an action, discards 5 city cards (in any combination of colors) at a research station. at least one of these cards must depict a city which currently contains one or more purple cubes. the purple disease can be eradicated normally by treating all purple cubes on the board after curing the disease. to cure the purple disease, the scientist discards any 4 city cards and the field operative discards any 3 city cards and turns in 3 purple sample cubes; in both cases at least one of the city cards discarded must depict a city currently containing one or more purple cubes. winning and l osing the players win by either: a. discovering cures to all 5 diseases or b. discovering cures for all 4 standard diseases and— at the same time or later—fully treating the purple disease (resulting in 0 purple cubes on the board). the players lose by all normal means, but also if there are no purple cubes in the supply when one is needed. the bio-terrorist wins if the players lose and there is at least 1 purple cube on the board. the bio-terrorist immediately loses (and is out of the game) if the players eradicate the purple disease. everyone loses if the players lose and there are no purple cubes on the board, or if they lose after eradicating the purple disease. etiquette the bio-terrorist may listen to the other players as they discuss their plans and cards; the other players may not leave the table to hold private discussions nor pass notes to each other. the bio-terrorist may not reveal infection cards in his hand until he plays them. the bio-terrorist must be honest recording his own location and reporting when he is spotted. he may taunt the other players on his turn, but should refrain from interrupting player discussions on their turns."
146,42452,RATTUS,2010,Z-MAN GAMES,2.0547,329,"setup the board is divided into 12 regions and a palace area. arrows indicate regions treated as neighbors. 2 players: use the light colored regions only. 3 players: use the light and middle colored regions. 4 players: use all regions on the board. lay the 6 class cards faceup beside the board. each player chooses a color and takes all the wooden cubes of that color. the 12 starting rat tokens (purple circles) are mixed facedown, and one is placed facedown in each region of the board (in a 2/3-player game, 8/10 regions are used, and only 8/10 starting rats are placed on the board). the regular rat tokens are mixed facedown as a supply beside the board. with less than 4 players, remove randomly drawn tokens (not the starting tokens) from the game. for 2 players remove 12 tokens; for 3 players remove 6 tokens. the remaining starting tokens are mixed together with the regular rat tokens. place the plague piece in a randomly chosen region. starting with the youngest player and going clockwise, each player places 2 of his cubes in any region. then, starting with the last player and going counter-clockwise, each player places 2 more of his cubes in any region on the board. the starting player takes the first turn, and the other players follow in clockwise order. turn sequence the active player plays through these phases. phase a and b may be done in any order, but phase c must always at the end of the turn. a. pick a new class card (optional) you may take one class card, either one beside the board or from another player. cards are kept clearly visible in front of each player. you must keep your class cards until they are taken away by another player (the only way to get rid of them). even if you already have one or more class cards, you are allowed to take another card during each of your turns. if you have more than one card at the same time, you gain all the advantages of all your cards. b. place new cubes on the board you may place cubes of your own color in any one region on the board. place as many cubes as the number of rat tokens currently in the chosen region. you may not usually add any cubes to a region with no rat tokens. c. move the plague piece finally, you must move the plague piece to a region (the plague region) neighboring its current location. you may choose freely among the neighboring regions, but the plague piece may not remain in its current region. then: 1. the plague spreads if the plague region contains no rat tokens, nothing happens. if the plague region contains one rat token, place a new token from the supply in any region neighboring the plague region. if the plague region contains 2 or 3 rat tokens, place 2 new rat tokens from the supply in any region(s) neighboring the plague region (either 2 in one region or one in each of 2 different regions). rat tokens must be placed facedown—no players are allowed to look at the front sides. there may never be more than 3 rat tokens at the same time in any one region. if all the neighboring regions contain 3 rats, no more rats are added. 2. the plague ravages the plague region if the plague region contains at least one wooden cube and one or more rat tokens, these tokens are revealed and evaluated one at a time, until either all tokens have been revealed or all the cubes in the region have been removed. remove all revealed rat tokens from the game. remaining facedown rat tokens stay in the region. as soon as the plague region either contains no more rat tokens or no more cubes, the current turn ends, and the next player begins his turn. rat tokens the rat tokens show the following information: limit value (top). if the total number of wooden cubes (regardless of color) in the plague region is equal to or greater than the limit value, there is an outbreak. if the number of cubes is lower, the rat token is removed from the game with no effect. one or more symbols (middle): for each given class symbol, the player currently owning the corresponding class card has to remove one of his cubes from the plague region and put it back into his supply. if he does not have any cubes in this region, he is not affected. symbols m (majority) or a (all) (bottom): for each m, the player currently having most cubes of his color in the plague region has to remove one cube. on a tie, all tied players must remove one cube each. for each a, all players with cubes there have to remove one cube each. m symbols are always evaluated first, affecting the player who has the majority of cubes in the region when the token is revealed. after the m symbols, the rest of the symbols are resolved in any order. the class cards only the player whose turn it is may use the special abilities of his class card(s). he may use the abilities of each card only once each turn, and only before phase c is played (exception: knight). king (royalty) a player with this card may, at any time during his turn, move one of his cubes on the board from a region containing no rats to the palace area. cubes in the palace are safe for the rest of the game, and count as regular cubes when counting scores at the end of the game.knight (chivalry) a player with this card may move the plague piece up to 2 regions in phase c, before the effects of the plague are evaluated. the player may also, before rat tokens are revealed, decide to let the plague piece count as 2 neutral population cubes in the affected region when evaluating population limits on the rat tokens. merchant (bourgeoisie) a player with this card may, at any time on his turn, move up to 3 cubes of his own color from one region to one of its neighboring regions. monk (church) a player with this card may, at any time on his turn, move any one rat token from any region to a neighboring region. this movement may be performed either before or after adding new cubes in phase b. peasant (peasantry) a player with this card may add one cube more than usual when he adds cubes to a region in phase b (eg, he may add 4 cubes to a region containing 3 rat tokens, or 1 cube to a region without rat tokens). witch (magic) a player with this card may, at any time on his turn, look at any one rat token on the board. then he may look at any other rat token on the board, either in the same or in a different region. finally, he may, if he wishes, swap the 2 selected rat tokens (if they are in different regions). game end the game ends after the turn during which either: – the supply of rat tokens is depleted, or – a player manages to have all his cubes on the board at the end of his turn (this is rare). a final round follows in which all players, except the player having the last regular turn, may use the abilities of their class cards one last time. this final round is played counter-clockwise, beginning with the player sitting to the right of the player who had the last regular turn. players are only allowed to use the abilities of the cards they currently hold. they may not take any new cards, add cubes (exception: peasant) nor move the plague piece (exception: knight). cards have their usual abilities, with these exceptions: peasant: a player holding this card may add a cube of his own color in any one region. knight: a player holding this card may move the plague piece up to 2 steps. when the game ends, the plague piece counts as 2 neutral population cubes in the affected region. finally, the plague ravages all the 12 regions (one at a time all rat tokens are revealed and evaluated). the player with the most cubes still in play on the board (including any in the palace) wins. on a tie, the winner is the tied player that would have had the next turn if the game had not ended.setup only 6 class cards are used. either draw 6 class cards at random after shuffling all 18 cards, shuffle the cards of the 6 different classes separately, then draw one at random for each class, use one of the suggested sets, or select a set that all players agree on. when playing with less than 4 players, it is recommended that at least one of the chivalry cards is included among the class cards used. after selecting the class cards, prepare the game as normal. then play the game as normal, using the 6 selected class cards. if 2 or more cards belonging to the same class are in play, each symbol on a rat token will kill one cube for each card of this class a player holds. card set suggestions prosperous times: peasant, baker, serf, queen, mayor, soldier. this set contains mostly cards that allow players to add extra cubes; the board will tend to become more populated than usual. rat control: pied piper, wizard, bishop, nun, monk, emperor. this set consists of cards that affect movement, placement or the resolution of rats. europe at war: knight, crusader, soldier, courier, merchant, pied piper. this set contains cards that allow the players to attack each other in various ways. new class cards only the player whose turn it is may use the special abilities of his class card(s). he may use the abilities of each card only once each turn, and only before phase c is played (exceptions: soldier, crusader and serf). crusader (chivalry) a player with this card may move the plague piece up to 2 steps in phase c, before the effects of the plague are evaluated. additionally, the player may reveal all the rat tokens in the plague region simultaneously, and then decide the order in which they will affect the region. courier (bourgeoisie) a player with this card may swap any 2 cubes on the board (ie, he may swap one of his own cubes with a cube belonging to another player in another region, or he may swap 2 cubes belonging to 2 other players). this swapping is not affected by any wall pieces in play. soldier (chivalry) a player with this card may move the plague piece up to 2 steps in phase c, before the effects of the plague are evaluated. additionally, when placing new rats in phase c, he may place one extra rat. if a player holds 2 or more chivalry cards, he will still only be able to move the plague piece up to 2 steps.mayor (bourgeoisie) a player with this card may, instead of adding cubes according to the regular rules (one cube per rat) in phase b, add one cube to each region in which he has more cubes of his color than any other player. if the player also holds the peasant card, the extra cube may be placed in one of the regions in which he has more cubes of his color than any other player. if the player also holds, and is able to use, the queen card, the 2 extra cubes may be placed in one or two of the regions in which he has more cubes of his color than any other player. he can choose not to use the ability of the mayor; if he prefers to he may place according to the number of rats instead. emperor (royalty) a player holding this card may place (or move, if already in play) the 3 wall pieces. a wall piece may be placed on a border between 2 regions on the board, or on an arrow connecting 2 regions. nothing can be moved across a border blocked by a wall piece, that is, neither rats, cubes nor the plague piece may cross this border until the wall is taken away. the nun and bishop pieces are not blocked by the walls, since these are placed freely on the board and not moved between regions. pied piper (magic) a player with this card may move one cube of his own color from one region into a neighboring region. if he does this, he has to move along as many rat tokens as possible from the original region into the new region. the wall pieces prevent such movement. if a player uses the pied piper to move a cube into a region containing a bishop piece, no rat tokens are moved along into the new region. the number of rats per region can still not exceed 3. thus, if a player moves a cube from one region into a neighboring region containing 2 rats, he only moves along one rat into the new region. the player is allowed to use the pied piper to move a cube into a neighboring region even if no rats can be moved along, that is, if the original region contains no rat and/or if the new region already contains 3 rats or a bishop piece. serf (peasantry) ain phase c of his turn, a player with this card may place one cube of his own color into the plague region for each rat token that kills at least one cube belonging to another player. the cube is placed in the region immediately, and may thus affect (and be affected by) the resolution of the remaining rat token(s). queen (royalty) if the player with this card has cubes of his color in a larger connected area than any other player, he may add 2 cubes more than usual when he adds cubes to a region in phase b.wizard (magic) a player with this card may place one potion token with one of his cubes anywhere on the board. a cube can possess more than one potion token. whenever a cube must be removed due to a plague outbreak in phase c, the owner of the cube may instead choose to remove a potion token placed with the cube. this does not count as the rat killing a cube for the purpose of using the serf card. baker (peasantry) a player with this card may place one cube of his own color on the baker card on each of his turns. whenever the baker card is taken by another player, that player immediately places all the cubes on the card in a region of his choice on the board. nun (church) a player with this card may place (or move, if already in play) the 3 nun pieces. a nun piece may be placed in any region, and several nuns may be placed in the same region. each nun piece reduces the population of the region by one for the purpose of evaluating the population limits on the rat tokens in phase c. bishop (church) a player with this card may place (or move, if both are already in play) one of the 2 bishop pieces. a bishop piece may be placed in any region, and both bishops may be located in the same region. no rats may in any way be moved into or placed in a region containing one or both bishop pieces. game end when the game ends there is a final counter-clockwise round in which all players, except the player having the last regular turn, may use the abilities of their class cards one last time. after the final round, and before the plague ravages all the 12 regions, if the baker card is in play the player to the left of the player currently holding the baker card places all the cubes on the card in a region of his choice on the board. cards have their usual abilities, except: queen: if the condition of the queen card is fulfilled, the player may add 2 cubes to any region. soldier: the player may add one rat into a neighboring region with the plague piece. if the supply of tokens is empty, draw at random from the used rat tokens. crusader: the player may move the plague piece up to 2 steps, reveal all the rats in this region and immediately resolve them in any order he chooses. mayor: the player may add one cube to one region in which he has more cubes than any other player. serf: the player may move the plague piece one step, and let the card affect the region moved into. card combination: if one player holds more than one of the cards that depend on the plague piece (crusader, knight, serf), he must apply the effects of these cards in the same region. pied piper"

= fix oxygen pumps action. crushed! = fix engine action. missiles launched! = stop missile launch action in the missile control room. devoured by a kraken! = kill kraken action outside the sub.if all players’ tks pass a destruction token on the time track, the game ends and the players lose. once a player’s tk moves past a destruction token on the track, he can no longer prevent it, and automatically fails an attempt if his tk moves past it as the attempt is being made. if actions associated both with a disaster track and a destruction token are successfully prevented, reset the track and remove the token. item actions a gnome in the equipment stores or the captain’s cabin may draw item tiles at 1min per item drawn. a gnome in the captain’s cabin may spend up to 2min drawing grog (until it’s all been claimed). a gnome in the equipment store may spend up to 4min equipping from the shuffled facedown item pile. a gnome may not draw item tiles again before he first takes an action in another room (place the gnome on the colored area in the room to indicate this). 2 gnomes in a room may trade item tiles. the active player gives the other player any number of tiles, and the target player then does the same. this costs only the active player 1 min. all items are discarded when played. when the pile is exhausted, shuffle the discards to form a new pile. other actions a player may take no action for 1min. after a player’s marker has passed 10 on the time track, he may perform the abandon comrades action. if his gnome can reach the sea space (with an aqualung item as usual), he uses all his remaining minutes. if the other players lose the game, he wins; if they win, he loses. situational modifiers to actions on fire the only action possible is extinguish fire. low water all actions except pump water and no action take +2min. high water the only action possible is no action. 3. faint check if a player played one or more grog tiles during his turn, he must make a faint check. draw an event card and check the faint number. then the card is discarded and its event ignored. if a dash, the gnome automatically passes. if a number is equal to or less than the gnome’s current intoxication level, the gnome passes out. lay the figure on its side and move the ghost tk forward 10 additional spaces. stand up on the player’s next turn (he retains the same intoxication level). track a gnome’s intoxication level by turning his gnome card. 4. updates the player moves his tk forward to meet the ghost tk, stopping in turn at each event marker (to draw an event card and resolve its effects) and each draw items marker (to draw an item tile). if both are on the same space, resolve the event card first. if the event deck is exhausted, shuffle the discards to form a new deck. the first time this happens, add the kraken card. if, at any time during the updates phase, any fainted gnome occupies a room with either high water or fire, that gnome immediately dies. if an active gnome both starts and ends his turn in the space outside the sub, the gnome dies. when a gnome dies, its player removes his figure and tk and is eliminated from the game. if he was the active player, also remove the ghost tk and resolve no further events until the next player’s turn. room events fire: if a selected room is flooded, no fire starts. otherwise, increase the asphyxiation track by 1. if the room doesn’t have a fire token, add one. candidate rooms for a spreading fire are those next to a room on fire that aren’t already on fire or flooded. the active player picks one; if there are none, there is no effect. flood: a random room is brought to high water; any fire there is extinguished. blocked hatch: the active player selects any non-blocked hatch adjacent to the chosen room (not exterior hatches). if all are blocked, no token is placed. game end the game is lost at any time a marker on a disaster track reaches its end; the players fail to prevent a timed destruction event; or all gnomes are killed. the game is won if all tks reach the rescued!

the top tile of every purple temple on the board, revealing its power. game turn on your turn, you must do the following actions: 1. move jungle trails and river trails link adjacent locations on the map. each turn, you must move your explorer along a trail. you cannot stay in the same spot or end a move on your starting location. you may move once along a single unfamiliar trail (one with no pathways of your own color on it). in addition, you may begin or extend your move along that unfamiliar trail by freely moving along any continuous chain of pathways of your own color (before or after that move, but not both). you may only move on a given trail or pathway once per turn, though you may pass through the same ruins or temple location multiple times. you must stop if you reach base camp. end your move and take 3 ration packs from there, placing them on your explorer’s chart. this free action ends your turn. you can never store more than 5 ration packs on your explorer’s chart at any given time.2. explore after your move, you may spend a ration pack to explore the location. discard the pack onto the base camp pile and take the action corresponding to your location. if you have no rations left to spend, you cannot explore and you skip this phase (unless you are in base camp). ruins discard the top ruin tile and place one of your pathways (if you have one) along an adjacent trail. a single trail may never have 2 pathways from the same player on it; pathways of different players may be on the same trail, but only benefit their respective owners. ivory temples flip the top ivory temple tile, read its power aloud, then place it (text faceup) in front of your explorer’s chart. you can never keep 2 ivory tiles of the same level/size. if you pick an ivory tile with the same level as one you already have, you must discard one. when applicable, you may still use the power of the tile you’re discarding. when choosing between 2 ivory tiles of the same level, take 2 vp from the victory coins pile in compensation for the tile you’re forced to discard. blue temples take the top blue temple tile, look at its value in secret, and place it facedown next your explorer’s chart. its value stays hidden from other players until game end. each blue tile gives you from +2 to +5 vps. purple temples take the top purple temple tile, apply its effects and immediately discard it. then flip the purple tile below it (if any), so that its power is visible. shrines when the last ruin or temple tile is removed from the board, a shrine and its hidden relic is uncovered. the player taking the last tile performs the corresponding ruin or temple action, then places a relic of the matching color on the shrine’s location. once a relic appears, the (fully-explored) ruin or temple can no longer be used for any action. however, it may still be used as a starting or arrival point for a relic expedition, and you can also still move through, or stop on, this location as normal. relic expeditions you successfully complete a relic expedition if you begin your turn on a shrine containing a relic, and end your move on another shrine containing another relic of the same color. you may then take the latter relic (you do not have to spend rations) and place it on your chart, scoring vp equal to twice the number of trails you moved along during this turn. the toolbox progression table you start the game with 1 toolbox at the bottom of your progression table. the other 2 are set aside on your chart. once a toolbox begins moving up a branch, it must stay on that branch until you decide to use it. several toolboxes may ascend the same branch or occupy the same spot.flipping toolbox tokens over when you move along trails with unused (colored side faceup) toolbox tokens on them, flip them over to their gray side upon completion of your move, revealing the empty toolboxes and immediately moving 1 (or more) of your toolboxes up the corresponding number of spaces on your progression table. only toolboxes already on the progression table or at its bottom may move up the table. a toolbox at the bottom may be moved onto the branch of your choice. if you move along multiple trails with unused toolbox tokens on them, you must flip all of them over, using them to move the toolbox(es) on your progression table as much as possible. in this case you can move a single toolbox several steps up, or move multiple toolboxes if you already have more than one on your table. flipping the last toolbox token over when you flip over the last toolbox token still faceup on the board, reset all toolbox tokens to their colored sides faceup, and move 1 of your toolboxes up 1 additional space on your progression table. if this last token flip occurred during a normal move, you must move 1 of your toolboxes 2 spaces upwards, or 2 toolboxes 1 space upwards each (one for the toolbox flipped during the move, and one for flipping the last toolbox token over). using a toolbox anytime during your turn (but without interrupting any other action), you may choose to use one of your toolboxes to perform the corresponding action on your progression table. when moving your explorer triggers multiple toolbox tokens to flip, these must all be done at once. when taking an action, move the toolbox associated with that action to the bottom of your progression table. then perform the corresponding action, all at once and in its entirety. you can only use a maximum of 1 toolbox per turn, no matter how many you may have on your table. as long as a toolbox is no longer in the reserve off the table, it is considered in the progression table, even if it is at the bottom of it. end of the game the last turn of the game occurs when a certain number of relics have been collected by all the players—this is marked on the board. once this condition is met, each player plays one final turn up to, but not including, the player that collected the final relic and triggered the last turn. it is still possible to collect relics during this final turn.vp (on coins and blue temple tiles in front of the players) are then revealed and counted. you score 5 bonus points for each different colored relic in your possession. add any other bonuses. the player with the most vp wins. on a tie, the tied player with the most relics wins. on a further tie the player with the most different relics wins.ivory temples 1st level at game end: 1 collect 3 points for each ivory tile in front of you, including this one. 2 collect 2 points for each unused ration pack still on your chart. 3 collect 5 points for each extra relic of the same color you have. 4 collect 1 point for each pathway you have on the board. 5 collect 4 points for each toolbox on your progression table (including at the bottom). 6 discard this tile to play 1 extra turn after the last player finishes his turn. 2nd level single-use: discard immediately after use (if used, you do not score 2 vp in compensation). 1 you may move on an unfamiliar trail in the middle of your move through your chain of pathways, rather than only before or after. 2 when exploring a temple, you may secretly look at its remaining levels and select the tile that you want, instead of the top one. 3 at the beginning of your turn, replenish your food reserves up to 5 ration packs, taking rations from base camp. 4 when placing a pathway, place 2 instead of one, both adjacent to your location. 5 when placing a pathway, place it anywhere on the board, not necessarily adjacent to your current location. 6 instead of moving, directly teleport yourself to a temple of the same color as the one you currently occupy. you cannot teleport yourself directly onto the location of a relic.3rd level permanent: only come into play after this action: 1 each time you place a pathway, score 1 vp. 2 each time you are the first player to explore a ruin or temple, immediately score 1 vp. 3 each time you score vps while exploring a temple (but not a ruin or shrine), score 1 bonus vp. when you explore a blue temple, you gain a bonus 1 vp coin, but don’t have to reveal the value of the tile. 4 each time an opponent moves a pathway already on the board to a different trail, take 1 rations pack from base camp (up to 5 on your chart). 5 each time you’re back in base camp, take 1 more ration pack than normal (up to 5 max on your chart). 6 each time you leave base camp, flip 1 toolbox token over, in either direction, anywhere on the board. this flip has no effect on the toolboxes on your chart—they do not move up, unless you flip the last toolbox on the map face down. purple temples 1 score 3 vps. 2 move 1 of your toolboxes 1 additional step up on your progression table. if you have no toolbox left to move, nothing happens. 3 take 2 ration packs from base camp and place them on your explorer’s chart (5 max). 4 place a new toolbox on the bottom of your progression table. 5 immediately teleport to base camp and take 3 ration packs. 6 move one of your pathways already on the board onto a different trail, anywhere on the board. 7 you must take the action of an adjacent ruin or temple location (not base camp) as if it was your current location. remove both the top purple tile and the top tile on that location. if this action lets you build a pathway, you must build it adjacent to the purple temple location you’re on. if you have no temple or ruin adjacent to your location, you still pay a ration to discard the top purple tile, but nothing else happens. 8 flip up to 2 toolbox tokens anywhere on the board, each either up or down. this does not cause any of your toolboxes to move up on your progression table. if you flip the last faceup toolbox token, move one of your toolboxes 1 step up on your progression table.explorer’s chart machete perform the temple action of your location without spending a ration. you may not use this on a ruin or a shrine. take 2 ration packs from base camp (up to 5 max on your chart). immediately score 4 vp for every relic on your explorer’s chart, even those of same colors. compass move one of your pathways onto any trail of your choice (except for those where you already have a pathway). it does not need to be adjacent to your current location. move 2 of your pathways onto trails of your choice (except for those where you already have a pathway). these do not need to be adjacent to your current location. immediately score 2 vp for each pathway in your longest continuous pathway route. a continuous pathway route cannot go through base camp. shovel move a toolbox from your reserve to the bottom of the table or score 2 vp. place a pathway from your reserve along a trail adjacent to your explorer. double all vp you score during this turn. when used on a blue temple, reveal the tile you want to double to all players and take the corresponding amount of vp from the reserve."

if it falls to 0 the player is vanquished. draw a number of power cards equal to the power limit on your character sheet (below the start space). place these facedown in front of you (you may look at your own at any time). draw 1 mission card and place it faceup in front of you. if your mission requires you to take any immediate action, do so. the oldest player takes the first turn. turn sequence on your turn complete all the following phases, then the next player in clockwise order takes their turn. 1 movement phase you must move to a new space; you cannot remain on your space, even if it contains a threat card. in the outer and middle tiers if you begin your turn in the outer or middle tier, roll 1 die to determine your movement points. you must move 1 space at a time, clockwise or anti-clockwise, spending 1 movement point for each space you enter. direction may not be reversed during a move. special abilities and cards may modify movement rolls and movement scores or provide alternatives to moving. in the inner tier move 1 space per turn in the direction indicated by the arrow on your space.2 exploration phase 1. check for threat icons threat icons indicate the minimum threat cards of each colour that must be on that space at the end of the exploration phase. on a space without threat icons, your exploration phase ends immediately. on a space with threat icons, go to the next step. 2. draw threat cards for each threat icon that exceeds the number of matching threat cards there, draw 1 card from the threat deck and of the matching colour and place it faceup on your space. if a space contains more threat cards than threat icons, they remain in that space until resolved or affected by an ability. if the number and colour of threat cards on your space equals or exceeds the number of corresponding threat icons, go to the engagement phase. threat cards that have threat icons on them add those threat icons to the space they are on during each exploration phase (including the one in which they are drawn). these icons have no effect during other phases. 3 engagement phase if at least 1 threat card is on your space, you must resolve step a. if there are no threat cards, you must resolve step b. if you are on a space without threat cards or a text box, your engagement phase ends immediately. a. resolve threat cards resolve all threat cards on your space: 1. resolve events: resolve the abilities of all events on your space, one at a time in any order you choose. a resolved event is discarded. 2. battle enemies: battle each enemy on your space before going to the next step. if you lose a battle, your engagement phase ends immediately and you cannot resolve other threat cards on your space. 3. resolve encounters: resolve the abilities of all encounters on your space, one at a time in any order you choose. resolved encounters remain on your space unless specified otherwise. you must resolve each encounter on your space during this step and cannot resolve the same encounter more than once during the same engagement phase. 4. acquire assets: take all assets on your space and place them faceup in front of you. b. resolve text box text boxes contain instructions you must resolve during your engagement phase if your space contains no threat cards. your engagement phase then ends immediately. if a space contain 2 text boxes and the instruction choose one or end engagement phase, the text boxes are optional. you may select and resolve a text box, or end your engagement phase. if a text box instructs you to draw and resolve a threat card, draw all required cards, place them on your space, and resolve them as normal. threat card timing event abilities are resolved during the first step of your engagement phase, then the card is discarded. enemy abilities are resolved when you battle an enemy. the card specifies the time during a battle at which you resolve the ability.encounter abilities are resolved during the third step of your engagement phase. these cards usually remain on your space after you resolve them. asset abilities are only resolved when in front of you and cannot be used while on the board. the owning player triggers the card’s abilities at the time specified. special timing cards specifically state the time when you resolve the card’s ability. an enemy’s special timing ability has no effect during a battle. 4 experience phase 1. spend trophies each time you win a battle against an enemy, take the enemy threat card as a trophy. each trophy has a trophy point value equal to the enemy’s attribute value. during this step you may spend (discard) trophies; for every 6 trophy points you spend, you gain 1 level. you may spend any number of trophies, but excess trophy points above multiples of 6 are lost. 2. manage mission cards you may spend 3 of your completed missions to reveal 2 relic cards and take one of them. if you have no active mission, draw 1 mission card. 3. discard excess cards you must discard any cards that cause you to exceed your power or asset limit. place discarded cards faceup on top of their corresponding discard pile. you may choose to discard power cards and assets even if they do not exceed your limits. battles there are 3 forms of battle: strength, willpower, and cunning. resolve battles as follows: 1. determine battle form: use the battle form that matches the enemy’s attribute type. 2. prepare for battle: you may declare and apply any battle bonuses used to modify your battle score. you may only use 1 weapon and 1 armour during a battle. 3. roll battle die (enemy): the player to your left makes a battle roll for the enemy by rolling 1 die. any roll that produces a result explodes, allowing him to roll an additional die. the player rolling the enemy die may not use any of his character or card abilities. 4. roll battle die (active player): make a battle roll by rolling 1 die. if you have an ability that allows the use of additional dice, roll all dice simultaneously. any roll that produces a result explodes, allowing you to roll an additional die. use abilities to reroll or change the result, if desired. 5. determine battle scores: any card abilities that add to the enemy’s battle score are resolved. the enemy calculates its battle score by adding its battle roll, its attribute value, and any applicable modifiers. calculate your battle score by adding your battle roll, your attribute value, and any applicable modifiers. 6. determine battle result: if your battle score is higher than the enemy’s, you win the battle. if the enemy’s battle score is higher than yours, you lose the battle. if the battle scores are equal, the result is a tie. resolve any card abilities triggered by battle results (win, lose, or tie) during this step.7. apply consequence: if you win, take the enemy threat card as a trophy and place it faceup in front of you (unless instructed otherwise). if you lose, lose 1 life, apply any penalties the enemy inflicts for losing, and end your engagement phase. any threat cards remaining on your space cannot be resolved this turn. on a tie, do not claim a trophy or lose a life; your engagement phase ends and the enemy card remains on your space. battle bonuses you may add battle bonuses from cards to your battle score (they do not affect skill tests). the colour of the circle with a spiked border indicates which battle form receives the bonus; red (strength), blue (willpower), yellow (cunning) and grey (any). you must declare that you are using a battle bonus during the prepare for battle step of a battle. multiple enemies if there is more than one enemy with different attributes on your space, choose the order in which you battle them, resolving each battle separately. if there is more than one enemy with the same attribute on your space, resolve a battle with all those enemies at the same time. add each enemy’s attribute value to a single battle roll to create a single battle score for all enemies. if you win, claim all enemies that participated in the battle as trophies. if you lose, lose 1 life, apply any penalties the participating enemies inflict for losing, and end your engagement phase. battles with scenario sheets players resolve scenario sheet battles using the normal steps. the scenario sheet is an enemy for the purposes of card abilities but has no traits, is not a threat card, cannot be taken as a trophy, and does not leave play. characters evading you may only evade when a special ability allows you to do so. trigger such abilities during the engagement phase before the start of a battle with the enemy. when you evade an enemy, it is prevented from participating in a battle during the engagement phase this turn. it remains on its space and is ignored for this turn—you do not need to participate in a battle with the enemy to continue your turn. when evading multiple enemies that share an attribute, you choose to evade each enemy individually. you are not required to evade all enemies in your space, and any enemies not evaded must participate in battles as normal. evading an enemy does not end your engagement phase. gaining levels each time you gain a level, move the level peg on your level track a slot to the right. then take all level rewards listed in the column below the new position, starting with the reward on the top. you may gain a maximum of 12 levels. if you gain a level while at level 12, gain 1 completed mission instead. assets and asset limits each character sheet has an asset limit that indicates how many assets you can have at the end of your experience phase. if you have a number of assets that exceeds your limit, you must discard any excess cards at the end of your experience phase.skill tests to resolve a skill test, make a skill roll by rolling 1 die and adding the result to your corresponding attribute value and any applicable modifiers to result in a skill score. if your skill score is equal to or greater than the target number, you pass the skill test. if the score is less, you fail. receive the reward or penalty described. if you roll a , you automatically fail the test. if you roll multiple dice during a skill roll, you automatically fail the test if each die produces a . if you roll a , it explodes, allowing you to roll an additional die. you may add skill bonuses from cards to your skill score during skill tests (they do not affect battle scores). declare that you are using a skill bonus before making your skill roll. the colour of the circle shows which attribute receives the bonus: red (strength), blue (willpower), or yellow (cunning). influence influence allows you to buy wargear cards and trigger abilities on specific cards and text boxes. each time you gain influence, take influence tokens from the supply and place them before you; return tokens to the supply when you spend them. missing turns if instructed to miss a turn, tip your character piece on its side. stand it up when you begin taking turns again. game effects can still interact with a piece on its side. if you miss a turn, your current turn ends immediately; skip your experience phase and do not implement any power or asset limits. then skip your entire following turn (any abilities implemented at the start or end of that turn cannot occur). vanquished players you are vanquished if your life is reduced to 0. discard all your power cards and trophies; return all your influence tokens to the supply; set your life dial to your starting value; and place your character piece on the st. antias’ sanctuary space. keep all other cards and tokens, and any of your character tokens on assets, power cards, or the board remain there. if you were vanquished during your turn, your turn then ends; take your next turn normally. corrupted players you are corrupted if you have a number of corruption cards equal to your corruption threshold (usually 6). you must start a new character. discard your power cards, trophies, and corruption cards; return all your influence tokens to the supply; return your character sheet and character piece to the box (it cannot be used by any player for the rest of the game), and draw a random unused character sheet. if none are available, you are eliminated instead. set up your new character and place your new character piece on its starting space. keep all other cards and tokens, and any character tokens on assets, power cards, or the board remain there. all cards inherited from your old character now belong to the new character. if you were corrupted during your turn, your turn then ends; take your next turn normally. you may choose not to start a new character and lose the game. eliminated players if you are eliminated from the game you remove your character piece from the board and discard all your cards and tokens. you lose the game, cannot start a new character, and cannot affect the game in any way.cards power cards you may draw power cards at the grey knight envoy space in the outer tier and the blackstone fortress space in the middle tier. if you choose to draw additional power cards, declare how many you wish to draw, spend the necessary influence, and draw the cards. keep power cards facedown. you may look at your own at any time. playing them is always optional; the card’s text indicates when they can be played. power cards have a power number at the top. immediately before you are required to roll a die to make a movement, battle, or skill roll, you may declare that you are playing a power card instead, and the power number on the card is treated as a substitute for the die result (this is equivalent to a die roll). you cannot use more than 1 power number as a substitute for a single roll. if you substitute a roll with a power card, it can explode as normal. you can substitute additional die rolls caused by an exploding die with a power card. you may use a power card’s power number or the special ability; not both. a power card is discarded when used; any number of them may be used during a turn. each power card you have counts as 1 card against your power limit. you may draw power cards beyond your limit; but you must discard excess power cards during the discard excess cards step of your experience phase. corruption cards corruption cards are placed in front of you and have an activation number at the upper right. after drawing a corruption card, if the activation number is greater than the total number of your corruption cards (including the one just drawn), the card is flipped facedown and the card’s ability is ignored. a facedown corruption card is in play and counts toward your total number of corruption cards, but has no other effect. if the corruption card’s activation number is less than or equal to the total number of corruption cards you have, the card activates and remains faceup. you must resolve its ability immediately. it remains activated, and any of its constant effects continue until it is discarded or flipped facedown. you can attempt to discard corruption cards at the apothecarium sepha or antian shrine world spaces in the middle tier. mission cards a mission card is kept faceup near your character sheet and can be completed at any time, in which case you immediately receive its rewards and flip it facedown. during your experience phase, if you have 3 or more completed missions, you may spend 3 to acquire 1 relic card. if an ability or reward allows you to gain a completed mission without having to fulfil its objective, draw the mission card and place it facedown near your character sheet; you do not receive any rewards on that card. if you do not have an active mission during your experience phase, automatically draw a new mission card. you may never have more than 1 active mission at a time. if you have an active mission and draw a mission card, immediately choose 1 to keep as your active mission and discard any others.relic cards you must have at least 1 relic card to enter the inner tier. when acquiring a relic card, reveal the top 2 cards from the relic deck, choose one, and shuffle the other back into the deck. you may have as many relics as your asset limit allows, and you may use any number of relics at a time. wargear cards you can buy wargear cards at the battlefleet antias space in the outer tier. spend influence equal to the cost in the card’s upper left corner, then place it faceup in front of you. all wargear cards are assets. they can only be used when in front of you, and they count toward your asset limit. wargear are either weapon, armour, or equipment. weapons and armour can only be used in a battle, and do not apply during skill tests. you can use only 1 weapon and 1 armour card during each battle, but you can use any number of equipment cards. charges when you draw a card with charge icons ( ), place charge tokens on the card equal to the card’s charge value (the number of icons). you can spend a maximum of 1 charge token from each card each turn to trigger specific card abilities. return spent tokens to the supply. when the last charge token is removed from a card, immediately discard the card. some effects allow you to add additional tokens to cards; added tokens can exceed the card’s charge value. discarding cards if you are forced to discard a card, choose which one unless instructed otherwise. if you do not have any of the required cards, discard nothing. if you are forced to discard more cards than you have, discard all cards you have of the listed type. any tokens on the discarded cards are removed and the cards are placed faceup in a discard pile next to their corresponding deck. you may discard any assets or power cards that you no longer wish to keep during your experience phase. you cannot discard cards outside of this phase unless a special ability allows you to do so. moving between tiers there are 3 spaces (grey knight envoy, battlefleet antias, and st. antias’ sanctuary) where you can cross to the middle tier by resolving their text boxes. after moving to the middle tier in this way, your engagement phase immediately ends and you do not resolve any cards or text on your new space. there are 2 spaces (space hulk and guardian of the rift) that contain movement boxes. each time you begin your movement phase on, or enter, such a space, immediately resolve the text. then continue your movement phase normally. when you move from one tier to another, you may change the direction of your movement upon entering the new tier. to enter the inner tier, you must have a relic and move from the guardian of the rift space. in the inner tier you do not roll a die for movement and cannot spend movement points. instead, you must move 1 space forward following the directional arrow on your current space, and you cannot use effects and special abilities that modify your movement. you must always resolve the text box in your new space during your engagement phase, and cannot draw or resolve threat cards. once in the inner tier, you may not return to previous tiers unless vanquished or corrupted. when you enter the warp rift your movement phase ends immediately. during your engagement phase, you are forced to skip ahead 1 space, plus 1 additional space for each condition listed you fulfil. do not resolve any text boxes on skipped spaces, but immediately resolve the text box on the space where you land. dice and tokens exploding dice if a player or enemy rolls a result on dice during a battle or skill test, those dice explode: immediately roll another die for each result. these extra results are added to the previous result to create a new score. exploding dice are cumulative and there is no limit to their number. additional dice: if an ability allows you to roll additional dice, roll all dice simultaneously. after you have rolled, you cannot trigger any abilities that allow you to roll additional dice, excluding exploding dice. modifying dice: each time you use an ability to modify a die, add or subtract your die result by the modifier. only the die result before modifiers is used for the purposes of exploding dice and triggering special abilities. rerolling a die: each time you reroll a die, the previous die result is ignored for all abilities and effects. a die may be rerolled multiple times by multiple abilities. if a deck is exhausted, shuffle the discards to form a new facedown deck. if there are no remaining discards, cards of that type cannot be drawn. the supply of charge, influence, and character tokens is unlimited; substitutes can be used. winning a player must complete 3 missions to acquire a relic, one of which is required to enter the inner tier. when a player lands on the central scenario space he can no longer move and must immediately resolve the confrontation section on the scenario sheet (which describes how to win the game); and continue to do so during each of his future engagement phases. the first player to fulfil the game-winning condition described in the confrontation section wins the game. clarifications in any instance where a special ability or text box conflicts with the rules, the special ability or text box takes precedence. any ability forbidding the use of cards, actions, or abilities overrides all other cards, abilities, and effects. if you resolve a card that grants you special movement during your movement phase, you may use the special movement even if that card is discarded during that turn. if you miss your turn, you may use the special movement during your next movement phase. place a character token under your character piece as a reminder that you have the option. if an ability moves you directly to another space, you do not move through any spaces in between and are placed directly on the destination space. if an effect refers to a condition and there are 2 or more available options that fulfil the condition, decide which option to use or in which order to fulfil them. if an effect refers to your highest or lowest attribute and you have 2 or more of the same number, choose to use. abilities on cards that include the word ‘may’ are optional. all other card and character abilities are mandatory."

reached their hand limit of 4 cards). these are placed facedown next to the board, forming a row of available strategy cards. the first available strategy card in the row (ie. first drawn) is bid upon (it remains facedown), starting with the first player who bids influence or passes. bidding then proceeds in the order of play. each player, in turn, must either bid or pass: bid: announces how much influence you are willing to pay for the card (minimum of 1 influence). if another player has already bid, you must bid at least 1 more influence than the current highest bid. you cannot bid more influence than you have in your reserve, and you cannot bid if your hand of strategy cards is already full (normally 4 cards), or if you have 0 influence. pass: when you pass, you may no longer bid on the current card; but you may bid on other available strategy cards when they come up for bid this phase. if you have passed you do not pay any influence, even if you previously bid on the card. bidding continues until a top bid is made and all other players pass. the top-bidding player must pay the number of influence he bid to the influence pool, then he receives the strategy card. strategy cards are kept facedown, but you may look at your own cards at any time. then begin a new round of bidding for the next available strategy card. the player to the left of the previous opening bidder starts the bid. if a player does not have any influence, or if he has reached his strategy card hand limit, he is not eligible to be the opening bidder. the player to his left opens the bid instead. the phase continues until all of the available strategy cards have been acquired or until a card is not bid on by anyone. if every player passes on the same bid, all of the available strategy cards are shuffled back into the strategy deck and the phase immediately ends. strategy card hand limit a player can never have more than 4 strategy cards in his hand at one time. if a player has a hand of 4 strategy cards, he must pass on all cards during this phase. the number (not the type) of strategy cards each player holds is always open to other players.3: recruitment starting with the first player and proceeding in the order of play, each player may recruit up to 5 of his units and one of his leaders from the casualty pool. a certain number of units may be recruited for free as indicated on the free recruitment section of your race sheets. additional units cost 2 influence per unit to recruit. free units recruited count toward the limit of 5 total recruits per round. all recruited units are placed in your reserves (next to your race sheet). leader recruitment when a leader is destroyed, place its token faceup in the casualty pool. during each recruitment phase, each player may recruit one of his leaders from the pool by paying influence equal to the leader’s strength. recruited leaders are placed in your reserves. a recruited leader can be used in battle as normal and is still subject to being a traitor and being destroyed by strategy cards. 4: maneuvering starting with the first player and proceeding in the order of play, each player performs one movement step and then one deployment step. complete both steps in sequence before the next player performs his phase. 1. movement step: you may move, as a group, any number of your units from one space to one other space. the units may move up to 2 spaces (following the movement lines connecting spaces), and must all end their movement in the same space. each movement line moved over costs 1 movement point. units cannot move through an area under the dreadnought fleet. you cannot move units into, out of, or through a space under bombardment (even if the space is shielded). units cannot end their movement in a space occupied by an ally’s units (except in the galactic council). otherwise, units may move into, out of, or through any space occupied by any number of units. spaceport movement bonus a player who controlled either the imperial navy base, civilian spaceport, or both at the start of this phase may move his unit group up to 4 spaces during his movement step. the unit group does not actually have to be in either of those spaces. 2. deployment step: you may make one deployment by moving any number of units from your reserve into any one space on the board. you must spend 1 influence per unit deployed into a friendly or empty space. if there are enemy unit(s) in the space, you must spend 2 influence per unit deployed. deploying units to the galactic council always costs 1 influence per unit. you cannot deploy units into a sector under bombardment (even if the space is shielded), or a space occupied by an ally’s units. you cannot move units from the board back to your reserves. controlling a space a player controls a space if he is the only player with units on the space. after every player has completed his maneuvering phase, play proceeds to the battle phase. 5: battle players cannot battle in the galactic council. starting with the first player and proceeding in the order of play, each player must resolve all of his battles (in the order of his choice). when enemy units no longer occupy the same space as his units, the next player in order of play resolves all of his battles. during each battle, both participating players use battle dials to choose the number of units they wish to commit (and sacrifice) for the battle. they also each choose a leader (who adds his strength to the committed units) and up to 2 strategy cards. the player with the lowest strength loses the battle and must destroy all of his units in the space. once all battles have been resolved, play proceeds to the collection phase. 6: collection 1. collect influence from mecatol city: for each of his units in a space, a player collects up to 2 influence from that space. collected influence is placed in your reserve. any influence not collected from the board remains in its space and is available to collect during future game rounds. 2. collect fleet support: each player then receives 2 influence from the influence pool (regardless of whether he collected influence from the board). phase 7: bombardment 1. draw bombardment card: the first player draws and reveals the top card of the bombardment deck. 2. move dreadnought fleet: the dreadnought fleet is moved a number of sectors equal to the number on the bombardment card. the fleet moves one sector at a time, always moving to the next highest sector number and looping back to sector 1 when it moves from sector 18. any units and influence tokens in sectors that the dreadnought fleet moves into are destroyed. the dreadnought fleet is not placed in a single space of the board, but between all spaces in its sector. the sector in which the dreadnought fleet ends its movement is considered under bombardment until it is moved again and prevents units from deploying into, moving into, and moving out of spaces in the sector. sectors that the dreadnought fleet passed over are no longer under bombardment and do not affect movement. units and influence tokens in shielded spaces are not destroyed when bombarded. however, units there still cannot move out of the space until the dreadnought fleet moves away. 3. shuffle bombardment deck: the first player shuffles the drawn bombardment card back into the bombardment deck. 4. pass first player token: pass the first player token to the player on the first player’s left. destroyed units and influence when units are destroyed, the tokens are placed in their race’s section of the casualty pool of the board. players must pay influence during the recruitment phase to return these units to their reserves (although players can recruit some for free). when influence is destroyed, the tokens are returned to the influence pool. influence resolving an influence card read the special ability on the card and perform its effect, then discard it faceup adjacent to the influence deck.. if the card places influence on the board, take the listed amount of influence from the influence pool and place it on the spaces indicated. if the space is currently under bombardment, no influence is placed.two special cards do not place influence on the board: sol offensive when revealed, look at the top influence- providing card in the influence discard pile. all units and influence in both of the listed spaces are destroyed (resolve them from left to right as listed). then return the card to the box and draw and resolve a new influence card. if another sol offensive card is drawn during this phase, return it to the box without effect and draw a replacement. during the first turn’s influence phase only, all sol offensive cards revealed have no effect and are instead shuffled back into the influence deck at the end of the phase. draw a new influence card and resolve its effects instead. temporary ceasefire all players have a chance to form and break alliances. players are also free to trade influence to each other as they see fit, even giving influence to players they are not allied with. although players may make nonbinding deals with players at any time, they may only bribe or otherwise trade influence with one another during a temporary ceasefire. once all players have finished forming and breaking alliances, the card is returned to the box and a new influence card is drawn and resolved. if another temporary ceasefire card is drawn during this phase, return it to the box without effect and draw a replacement. alliances forming an alliance players may discuss among themselves the advantages and disadvantages of allying and with whom. up to 3 players can form an alliance, but a larger alliance requires the players to control more strongholds to win the game. when players form an alliance, each player gives one of his ally advantage cards to each of his allies. each player places his ally’s card(s) faceup in his area as a reminder that they are in an alliance and the special ability their ally provides. several alliances may be formed during a temporary ceasefire but no player may belong to more than one alliance at a time. once all players have had a chance to form an alliance, no further alliances can be made until the next temporary ceasefire card is drawn. optionally, all players may agree upon a time limit for resolving temporary ceasefires (eg. 2 minutes). breaking an alliance you may break off from your alliance during a temporary ceasefire (and only then) by announcing it, returning your allies’ ally advantage card(s) to their owners, and retrieving all of your own. players who break from an alliance have an opportunity to immediately form a new alliance. effects of an alliance each member of an alliance receives these benefits: • if members of an alliance control the required number of strongholds at the end of a round, all members of that alliance win the game together). • allies assist each other as indicated on their ally advantage card. any of these abilities that use the word “may” are used only with the original owner’s permission. • players cannot deploy or move units in a space where one of their allies already has units, although they may move through them. since allies can never coexist in the same space, allies may never battle each other. players do not gain access to their allies’ spaceports or their allies’ race advantages (except as listed on the ally advantage card).battles when 2 players have units in the same space during the battle phase, a battle must be resolved. if more than 2 players’ units occupy the same space, multiple 2 player battles are resolved there one at a time in the order of play. to resolve a battle, perform the following steps in order: 1. situation report: each participating player must declare aloud how many units he has in the area, how many strategy cards he has in hand, and the strength of the leaders in his reserve. each player then flips his leader tokens facedown so that his opponent cannot see which leader token he will choose. 2. choose strength: each player in the battle takes a battle dial and secretly selects a number from 0 up to the number of units he has in the space where the battle is being fought. 3. commit leader: each player in the battle secretly chooses one of his leader tokens from his reserve, and also secretly chooses what types of strategy cards he will commit to this battle. he can choose either no card, one attack card, one defense card, or one attack card and one defense card. the player attaches his chosen leader (faceup) into the slot that matches his strategy card choice. by selecting this slot, the player is committing to playing this type of card(s) during step 4 of the battle. a player cannot play more than one attack (red) and one defense (blue) card per battle. each player is also required to commit a leader token to each battle (unless he is unable to). 4. reveal battle dials: when both players have chosen strength and committed a leader, they simultaneously reveal their battle dials. 5. commit strategy cards: both players then secretly and simultaneously choose strategy cards from their hands matching the icons on the slot they selected with their leader. once both players have selected their card(s), they are simultaneously revealed. if a player placed his leader in the attack icon slot during step 3, he is required to commit this type of strategy card during this step. 6. reveal traitors (optional): if a player in the battle has a traitor card that matches the leader token his opponent placed on his battle dial, he may reveal and discard the traitor card to immediately win the battle regardless of attack score: skip to determine winner below. when a leader’s traitor card is revealed, the leader is destroyed and both player’s chosen strategy cards are not resolved (the loser’s cards are still discarded). the traitor card is then shuffled into the deck of unused traitor cards. if both players reveal a traitor card, both players automatically lose the battle. 7. resolve committed strategy cards: in order of play, each player resolves his chosen strategy cards. many strategy cards destroy the opponent’s leader unless he committed the proper strategy card. destroyed leaders are immediately moved to the casualty pool and do not contribute their strength when determining the winner of the battle. 8. determine winner: each player adds his leader’s strength to the number selected on his battle dial to determine his combat strength. the winner of a battle is the player with the highest combat strength. if both players have the same combat strength, the player whose turn is earliest in order of play wins the battle.the loser must destroy all of his units in the space and must also discard all strategy cards he committed to the battle. the loser’s leader is not destroyed as a result of losing the battle. leaders are destroyed only as a result of a strategy card or if the leader’s traitor card is revealed. the winner must destroy a number of his units in the space equal to the number selected on his battle dial. if a player wins a battle by revealing a traitor card, he does not destroy any of his units. the winner may keep or discard any of the strategy cards he committed to the battle. strategy cards may only be discarded after use in battle or as specified on the strategy card. leaders in battle during battle, players should keep their leader tokens facedown so that their opponent does not know which leader token they are selecting. the strength of each player’s leader tokens is public information. if a player asks about leader strength during battle, his opponent should verbally tell him the information while keeping his leader tokens secret. when a leader is destroyed, its token is placed faceup in the casualty pool on the game board. a player may pay influence during the recruitment phase to return one of his leaders from the casualty pool to his reserves. a leader committed to a battle cannot be committed to a battle in another space during the same round. the leader may be selected for battle in the same space, however. if a player cannot select a leader for battle (all of his leaders are destroyed or already fought in another space that game round), he must declare that he is without a leader and he cannot play any strategy cards during the battle. the player’s attack score is the unit strength selected on his battle dial. other rules secrecy you may never show your traitor and strategy cards to other players, though you may tell other players this information or even lie about it. the number of units and leaders in your reserves, the leader strength, the number of strategy cards in your hand, and their available influence are all public knowledge. you cannot discuss strategies secretly with other players, even if you are allied. all discussions must take place openly. you cannot write down information to remember it. making deals you can make any kind of verbal deal. these are not binding, and any exchange of influence cannot be undone. influence can only be part of the bribe or deal when resolving a temporary ceasefire influence card. a deal or bribe cannot involve other game components or contravene the rules of the game. component limitations as soon as the last strategy card is drawn from the deck, all of the discarded strategy cards are shuffled and placed facedown to form a new strategy deck. you are free to ‘make change’ for influence in your reserves, on the board, or amongst players. all game components are limited by those in the game.rounding up whenever a rule or effect refers to losing or paying half of a component, it is always rounded up. timing conflicts if 2 players want to use cards or advantages at the same time, resolve these abilities following the standard order of play. the only exception is a card that would cancel another card or advantage: the cancel effect is resolved first. winning the game an unallied player wins the game if he alone controls at least 3 strongholds at the end of a round. an alliance of 2 players wins the game if they control at least 4 strongholds at the end of a round. each player in the alliance shares the win. an alliance of 3 players wins the game if they control all 5 strongholds at the end of a round. each player in the alliance shares the win. if no player has won by the end of the 8th game round, the sol and hacan players may be able to win by use of their special victory conditions. if neither of these players have won the game, the single player (ignoring alliances) who controls the most strongholds wins the game alone. his allies do not win with him. if multiple players are tied for control of the most strongholds, they share the victory. sol victory the sol player wins the game if he fulfills both of the following conditions: 1. no player has won the game by controlling strongholds (alone or as part of an alliance) by the end of round 8. 2. the sol (or no player, not even an ally) controls the imperial palace and the mecatol power south. if the sol player fulfills both of these conditions while a member of an alliance, each player in his alliance shares the win. hacan victory the hacan player wins the game if no player has won the game by controlling strongholds or by sol victory by the end of round 8. if the hacan player fulfills his special victory condition while a member of an alliance, each player in his alliance shares the win. xxcha victory at the start of the game, the xxcha player predicts a player and a game round, recording this prediction by choosing a race prediction token and a round prediction token and placing them facedown next to his race sheet. unchosen tokens are returned to the game box without being revealed. if the chosen player wins (alone or as an ally, even as the xxcha’s ally) with any victory condition during the predicted game round, the xxcha player wins the game instead. if the xxcha player fulfills this victory condition, he wins the game alone: he does not share the win with other players in his alliance. v1.1"
153,205896,RISING SUN,2018,CMON,3.29,600,"setup each player chooses a clan and places their clan screen in front of them and a political/war tile behind it (political side faceup). nothing should be hidden behind your screen during the political phase. during the war phase, bids are hidden behind the screens, but nothing else. place 1 of your clan markers on the first space of the victory point track.all players check their starting honor rank (shown on their clan screen) and place their other clan marker on the honor track, in order with the lowest numbered rank at the top and with no spaces between markers. players must sit in increasing order of starting honor rank, going clockwise around the table. the clan with the lowest numbered starting rank will be the first to play, and play will then proceed in clockwise order. sitting/play order stays the same throughout the game. place your clan’s daimyo figure (with a black base), 3 shinto figures (with white bases), and 6 bushi figures next to your clan screen, in sight of the other players. this is your reserve. take all the plastic bases in your clan’s color (these will be used if to identify your monsters). all figures have 1 force, unless otherwise stated on a player’s specific season card. take your 4 stronghold tokens and your alliance token. each player places 1 daimyo figure, 1 bushi figure, and 1 stronghold token in their home province (shown on their clan screen). shuffle the 7 shrine tiles facedown, draw 4 and place them faceup on the shrine slots on the board, from left to right. return the remaining tiles to the box. place the core season cards facedown next to the board in 3 separate decks: spring, summer, and autumn. players choose (or pick randomly) which set of season cards they will use in this game: take its 5 cards for each of the seasons and add them to the core decks. each of the season decks should then contain 12 cards. return all other season cards to the box. separate the war province tokens according to their number: i, ii, and iii, and shuffle them into 3 facedown piles, each with 8 tokens. place them next to the board. place all the war number tokens next to the board. shuffle the 10 political mandate tiles facedown and place them in a pile next to the board. place all monster figures, and common piles of coins and ronin tokens, next to the board. coins and ronin tokens are the only unlimited resource.honor the clan with their marker at the top of the honor track has the highest honor, while the clan at the bottom has the lowest honor. if a clan’s marker is above another’s, it has higher honor than them; if a clan’s marker is below another’s, it has lower honor than them. in any tie, the tied player with the highest honor wins.if there’s a conflict in the timing of an ability, the involved player with higher honor decides whether to go first or last. no two clans can ever occupy the same slot on the honor track. each time you gain/lose honor, move your marker up 1 slot/down 1 slot on the track, at the same time moving down 1 slot/up 1 slot the marker that was above/below it. if you are already at the top of the track, gaining honor has no effect. if you are already at the bottom (disregarding any empty slots at the bottom), losing honor has no effect. negotiation players can make deals at any point in the game, whether with their ally or with an enemy. no deals are binding, and deals can be made in secret. bribery can only be done during the tea ceremony and the political phase, not during the war phase. players may give coins and ronin tokens from their reserve to other players to try to convince them to do something. game round (season) 1. seasonal setup prepare for war take the randomized war province tokens for the current season (i = spring, ii = summer, iii = autumn) and place them faceup on the war province slots on the board. place a number of tokens equal to the number of players plus 2. then place the war number tokens in the war number slots of the provinces indicated by the war province tokens on the board. return any unused war number tokens to the box. set season cards discard any season cards left next to the board from the previous season. place all the current season’s cards faceup next to board, within reach of all players. identical cards may be placed on top of each other, staggered to show the number of piled cards. seasonal income players should have no coins at this point. each player then takes a number of coins from the common pile equal to their seasonal income (as shown on their clan screen). return hostages players return any figures they have taken hostage to their owners, getting 1 coin from the common pile for each figure returned. 2. tea ceremony any alliances from a previous season are unmade, and players have the opportunity to negotiate new alliances. alliances are between pairs of players, who must both be in agreement. the allied players join their alliance tokens together and place them in view of all players. alliances last for the current season (unless broken by a betray mandate), and no new alliances can be made until the next season. allied players grant each other powerful bonuses from the mandates they play during the political phase. allied players don’t fight each other during the war phase if they are the only ones in a province. victory goes automatically to the one with the highest force. in a battle involving 2 allied players and other players, if one of the allied players is victorious, they don’t kill the figures of their ally. allied players are still considered opponents for the purpose of season card abilities and other effects. if an allied player plays the betray mandate, they immediately lose honor and the alliance is broken. if the game ends in a tie between allied players, they share the victory. 3. political phase players take turns selecting political mandates to prepare their clans and position their forces. as shown on the political track on the board, the phase follows this order: 3 mandate turns > kami turn > 2 mandate turns > kami turn > 2 mandate turns > kami turn > war phase starts at the start of the game, the player whose clan is at the top of the honor track takes the deck of political mandates to play the first mandate turn. at the start of the following seasons, the first player to perform a mandate turn is the one to the left of the player who performed the last mandate turn on the previous season. keep the deck of political mandates close to the player who will play it next. the player who has deck of political mandates draws the top 4 mandate tiles, looks at them in secret, chooses one, and returns the other 3 facedown to the top of the deck, without reshuffling. they then place the chosen political mandate faceup on the first available political mandate slot on the board (from left to right). one by one, in clockwise order starting with the player to the left of the player, each player performs the chosen mandate. the effects of each mandate are summarized on each player’s political tile. except for the betray mandate, all mandates have 2 components: one part that all players may perform and one bonus part that only the current player and their ally (if they have any) may perform. only the player who selected it and their ally are allowed to also perform the mandate’s bonus. when all players have performed the mandate, the current player passes the facedown deck of remaining political mandates to the player to their left, who becomes the next current player and executes the next mandate turn, if any. recruit all players you may summon 1 of the figures you have in reserve to each of the provinces where you have a stronghold. if you have more than 1 stronghold in the same province, you may summon a number of figures there equal to the number of strongholds there. there is no limit to the number of figures that may occupy each of the provinces. if you have no more figures in your reserve, you cannot summon another figure. current player and their ally you may summon 1 additional figure to any one of your strongholds, even if you have already summoned a figure there. summoning shinto when you summon a shinto warrior (and only at the moment when it is summoned), you may choose to immediately take it from the province where it was summoned and place it on any of the 4 shrine tiles on the top of the board. there is no limit to the number of shinto figures that may occupy each of the shrines. a shinto worshipping at one of the shrines is not considered to be on the map, and cannot be moved to the map or to a different shrine. marshall all players you may move each of the figures you have on the map to an adjacent province (either crossing a border or taking a shipping route). you may move any number of your figures (or none). each figure can only be moved once. current player and their ally you may discard 3 coins to the common pile, take 1 stronghold from your reserve, and place it in any province. it doesn’t have to be adjacent to a province where you already have a stronghold, and there is no limit to the number of strongholds in each province. you cannot build more than your 4 strongholds. train unlike other mandates, the player who selects this mandate performs it first, having first pick of the available cards. all players you may get 1 of the season cards currently displayed next to the board by paying its coin cost to the common pile (some cards are free). place the new season card faceup next to your clan screen. its ability is considered immediately in effect. you may get more than 1 copy of the same card over subsequent trainings, in which case their abilities stack together. current player and ally if you get a season card, you may pay 1 less coin than its listed cost (to a minimum of 0). you can still only get a single season card per train mandate. monsters when you get a monster season card, you also take the corresponding monster figure, attach one of your counter bases to it, and immediately summon it to any province where you have a stronghold. the monster now counts as one of your clan’s figures, and has 1 force, unless otherwise stated. if it’s killed, it returns to their reserve and may be summoned again to the map like a normal clan figure. there is no limit to the number of monsters a clan may have. harvest all players you gain 1 coin from the common pile. current player and their ally you collect the rewards listed for every province where you currently have the most force. as always, if there’s a tie, the tied player with the highest honor is considered to have the most force in the province. victory point move your clan marker up 1 slot on the victory point track at the bottom of the board. coin take 1 coin from the common pile. ronin take 1 ronin token from the common pile.betray betray only benefits the current player. if the player is in an alliance, it is immediately broken and the betraying player loses honor. if the betraying player was not in an alliance, they do not lose honor. choose up to 2 figures on the map, belonging to 2 different players, and immediately replace them with figures of the same type that you have in their own reserve. you cannot replace 2 figures belonging to the same player, replace an opponent’s figure with one of yours that is already on the board, or replace an opponent’s figure with one from your reserve that’s a different type. you cannot replace a figure if you don’t have a figure in reserve of the same type. a monster in reserve can be used to replace another monster. the replaced figures are returned to their owners’ reserves (though they are not considered to have been killed). if you just broke your alliance, you don’t necessarily have to replace one of the figures of your former ally. daimyo figures and shinto figures on the shrines are not affected by betrayal. replacing a figure is not considered a summon (shinto cannot be sent to worship). kami turns players resolve the effects of each of the 4 shrine tiles in order, starting from the leftmost and proceeding to the right. in each shrine, the clan with the most force immediately executes the benefit granted by that shrine’s kami before resolving the next shrine. if there’s a tie, the tied player with the highest honor is considered to have the most force. if a shrine has no shinto on it, it’s skipped during this kami turn. amaterasu allows you to move your clan marker straight to the top slot on the honor track, shifting all others down in the process. this may change the honor tiebreaker when resolving the following shrines in this kami turn. fujin allows you to perform up to 2 moves with your figures on the map. you may either move 2 of your figures to adjacent provinces, or 1 of your figures twice in a row; either across a border or along a shipping route between provinces. raijin allows you to summon 1 bushi from your reserve and place it in any province on the map, even if you don’t have a stronghold there. ryujin allows you to get a season card from those available, paying its full coin cost just like in a train mandate. hachiman grants you ronin tokens from the common pile.susanoo grants you a number of vps equal to the number of strongholds you currently have on the map. tsukuyomi grants you coins, taken from the common pile. 4. war phase all players flip their political/war tiles to the war side. resolve any war upgrade season cards. at start of war phase effects take place at the start of the war phase of each season, not at the start of each battle. during the war phase, players cannot freely give each other coins or ronin tokens as part of their negotiations. each season, there will only be war in the provinces marked with a war number token. starting with the number 1 province and proceeding in ascending order, war is resolved in each province, one at a time: if nobody has any force in the province, nothing happens and the war province token is discarded. if only 1 player has any force in the province, they take the war province token and place it, faceup, next to their can screen. if only 2 allied players have force in the province, no battle takes place. the player with the most force there takes the war province token and places it, faceup, next to their clan screen. on a tie, the tied player with the highest honor is considered to have the most force in the province. if at least 2 players who are not allied have force in the province, a battle takes place to determine the winner. 5. seasonal cleanup discard coins and ronin: return all coins and ronin tokens in players’ reserves to the common pile. return shinto: return all figures on the shrine tiles are to their owners’ reserves. return political mandates: shuffle the political mandates on the board back with the deck of political mandates. winter season endgame the only season setup step that must be executed during winter is return hostages. players may then gain extra vps for the following: winter upgrades: these season cards grant extra vps depending on different criteria. war province tokens: each war province token a player collected grants the number of vps listed on it, depending on the season in which it was won: spring = 1 vp summer = 2 vps autumn = 3 vps war province set bonus: players get a vp bonus according to the number of war province tokens they accumulated of different provinces. only tokens of different provinces count: # different war province tokens vp bonus 3-4 10 vps 5-6 20 vps 7-8 30 vps record your vps with your clan marker on the vp track. if you go beyond 50, move your marker back to the 1 slot and flip it upside down to remember to add 50 points to your score. the player with the most vps is the winner. on a tie, the tied player with the highest honor is the winner. if 2 allied players are tied in first place, they share the victory. resolving battles battles only take place in provinces where at least 2 players who are not allied with each other have force. the battle involves all players who have any force in that province, even if they are allied. before a battle begins, all players clearly display their coins and ronin tokens next to their clan screens and truthfully answer how many coins and ronin tokens they have, if asked.first, any start of a battle abilities trigger. then, the involved players take all their coins behind their clan screen and, simultaneously and in secret, allocate them to the different war advantage spots on their war tile. you may allocate any number of coins to each spot (including 0). place any you don’t wish to allocate behind the screen, below the war tile. once all players declare that they are done allocating their coins, they all lift their clan screens simultaneously, revealing their bids. coins placed outside the war tile don’t count for this battle and are returned to that player’s reserve. players then compare the number of coins allocated by each player in each of the slots, starting from the leftmost and proceeding to the right. each war advantage is won by the player who bid the most coins on it. if there’s a tie, the tied player with the highest honor is considered to have the most coins in that war advantage. if no players bid any coins on a war advantage, it is skipped and the next one is resolved. only the player who wins a war advantage may execute it. you may choose not to execute a war advantage you won. when all provinces with a war number token have been resolved, the war phase comes to an end. war advantages are resolved one by one, from left to right. seppuku the winner may choose to immediately kill all their figures in the province, gaining 1 vp and honor for each figure. if you decide to perform seppuku, you must kill all of your figures, and you are still in the battle, even if you no longer have any figures in the province. take hostage the winner may choose to capture 1 figure in the province belonging to another player (even their ally). remove the chosen figure from the province and place it next to your clan screen. it is only returned to its owner during the setup of the next season (the figure has not been killed, only captured). if you take a hostage, you also steal 1 vp from the clan that owns the captured figure. move that clan’s marker back 1 slot on the vp track, and move your marker forward 1 slot. if the targeted clan doesn’t have any vps, you don’t get any vps. daimyo are immune to this effect and cannot be targeted by this war advantage. hire ronin the winner may choose to add their ronin tokens to their forces in the province: for each token they have in reserve, they gain +1 force to determine the outcome of the battle. ronin tokens are not spent when they are used, and all of them will be available to be hired again in a following battle. if a player with no ronin tokens wins hire ronin, they don’t get to add any force to their figures. battle outcome players compare the total force they have in the province. the clan with the most force wins the battle and places the war province token faceup next to their clan screen. if there’s a tie, the tied player with the highest honor is considered to have the most force in the province. all the figures in the province belonging to the players who lost the battle are immediately killed. if one of the losers is allied with the winning player, their figures are not killed.if, at the end of a battle, no players have any force left in the province, the player with the highest honor wins. imperial poets the winning player gains vps equal to the total number of figures that were killed in the course of this battle. it doesn’t matter who owned the figures, nor how they were killed. to easily count them, keep killed figures separate from each player’s reserves until imperial poets has been resolved. war reparations all losing players discard all coins they allocated on the war tile to the common pile. the winning player gives all coins they allocated on their war tile to the losing players. distribute them equally among the losing players, who place them in their reserves to use in the following battles. if the number of coins can’t be distributed equally, the winning player decides which player(s) should get an extra coin. clans koi clan at the start of the war phase, the koi player must discard all ronin tokens they have and take the same number of coins from the common pile. when resolving the hire ronin step of a battle, all coins the koi player has in their reserve count as ronin tokens. dragonflfly clan when the dragonfly player summons one of their figures, it can be placed in any province, whether they have a stronghold there or not. the number of figures they can summon with a recruit mandate is still tied to the number of strongholds they have on the map. when the dragonfly player moves one of their figures, it can be placed in any province on the map, no matter how far. their figures never have to use shipping routes to move from one province to another. lotus clan on their mandate turns, the lotus player selects one of the 4 political mandates they drew and places it facedown on the board, without any of the players seeing what it is. the lotus player then announces what political mandate will be executed, choosing anything they want. bonsai clan the cost of everything the bonsai clan buys, season card or a stronghold, is limited to 1 coin at most. if it cost 2 or more coins, it costs 1 coin; if it cost 0 coins, it remains free. in case the bonsai player benefits from a discount, such as the train mandate bonus, it applies after the clan ability, bringing the cost to 0. turtle clan when the turtle player moves their figures, they can choose to move their strongholds as well, just as if they were clan figures. each turtle clan stronghold also counts as 1 force in the province they occupy, exactly as if they were clan figures. this may influence both harvest and war . however, strongholds may never be killed, never be taken hostage, and never be replaced by a betray mandate."

there is no cost in coins or actions. a card without a kraken symbol is placed in your tide card discard pile after being used or discarded. a played card with 1 or more kraken symbols on it is placed in a faceup pile called the kraken pool. if your tide deck runs out, reshuffle the discards, not including the cards in the kraken pool. if an effect allows you to take a discarded card back into your hand, you can take a card from your kraken pool. winning the game the first player to accumulate 6 vps wins the game. 3 to 6 players players on the same team may share information and make decisions as a team. final say belongs to the player controlling the hero or card being played. 3 players (2 vs 1) each team may have a maximum of 2 deployed heroes at a time. during the deploy heroes phase, additional heroes may be deployed if the total number of deployed heroes plus dead man’s tokens for that team is less than 2. 2 player team: each player controls 1 of the deployed heroes. the starting tide card hand limit is 2 cards per player. all buffs from destroying objectives apply to both members of the team. 1 player team: the starting tide card hand limit is 4 cards. 4 players (2 vs 2) each team may have a maximum of 2 deployed heroes at a time. during the deploy heroes phase, additional heroes may be deployed if the total number of deployed heroes plus dead man’s tokens for that team is less than 2. each player controls 1 of the deployed heroes. the starting tide card hand limit is 2 cards per player. all buffs from destroying objectives apply to both members of a team. 5 players (3 vs 2) one player from each team controls the tide cards. all buffs from destroying objectives apply to all members of a team. 3 player team: each player controls 1 of the deployed heroes. 2 player team: one player controls 1 of the deployed heroes and the tide cards. the other player controls 2 of the deployed heroes. 6 players (3 vs 3) each player controls 1 of the deployed heroes. one player from each team controls the tide cards. all buffs from destroying objectives apply to all members of a team."

if there are no other participating units, none are destroyed.conduct a battle a battle occurs when you engage in combat against a target not controlled by another player. the goal is to secure a stronghold or city, attack an enemy card, or defend against an instant card attacking your home realm. 1. declare target declare target (stronghold, neutral city, enemy, or instant). 2. assault play unit or tactic cards one at a time from your hand. if you want to use a card’s when played ability, you must do so immediately after playing the card. using unit abilities is always optional. stop playing cards whenever you choose or when you have no unit or tactic cards in hand. 3. attrition roll the attrition die if the target is an event with an attrition die icon in its lower-left corner. you must destroy that many participating units of your choice. 4. resolution apply all resolution abilities on participating unit, tactic, and enemy cards, in an order of your choice. then resolve the battle based on which side has the highest total strength. on a tie, your army wins the battle. secure a stronghold or city: army: you succeed; take the stronghold or city into your play area above your home realm. stronghold/city: you fail; it remains in its place of origin. a player may attack it during a future turn. attack an enemy card: army: you succeed; if the enemy becomes a reward card, places it in your play area. otherwise, place it in the event card discard pile. enemy: you fail; it remains in the central play area. a player may attack it during a future turn. defend against an instant card: army: you successfully repel the attack. (if this instant is supposed to continue attacking other players, place it in front of the next player in clockwise order so he can battle against it.) instant: subtract the instant’s strength from your army’s strength to determine how many points worth of damage tokens you place on your home realm. 5. end of combat all wounded units are destroyed and returned to their place of origin in the barracks/central play area. all surviving units go to their owner’s discard pile. you may conduct several battles over the course of your turn, but you may only attack each target once per round. you are also limited by the cards in your hand and, unless you have a unit with a card-drawing ability, you do not replenish your hand until the end of a player’s turn (including your own turn).conduct a siege a siege occurs if you engage in combat against a target controlled by another player. the goal is to secure a city controlled by another player or to deal damage to an opposing home realm. 1. declare target declare target (player-controlled city or home realm). strongholds cannot be chosen as a siege target. 2. assault both players involved in the siege alternate playing one unit or tactic at a time, starting with the attacking player. when you play a new unit, announce the current total strength of your army. if you want to use a card’s when played ability, you must do so immediately after playing the card. using unit abilities is always optional. players alternate playing cards until both players pass: by choice (you do not want to play more cards, even though you have more in your hand) or by default (there are no more cards in your hand). once you pass, you cannot play any more cards during this siege. 3. resolution apply all resolution abilities on participating unit, tactic, and enemy cards. the attacking player resolves all of his resolution abilities first, followed by the defender. if the target is a city, add the auto-defense bonus to the defending army’s strength. then resolve the siege based on which side has the highest total strength. on a tie, the defending player wins the battle. siege a player-controlled city: attacking army: the attacking player secures the city and places it refreshed in his play area. defending army: the defending player successfully repels the attack. he keeps the city in its current state (exhausted or refreshed). siege a home realm: attacking army: the defending player subtracts his army’s strength from the attacking army’s strength to determine how many points worth of damage tokens he places on his home realm. defending army: the defending player successfully repels the attack. 4. end of combat all wounded units are destroyed and returned to their place of origin in the barracks/central play area. all surviving units go to their owner’s discard pile. you may conduct several sieges over the course of your turn, but you may only attack each target once per round. you are also limited by the cards in your hand and, unless you have a unit with a card-drawing ability, you do not replenish your hand until the end of a player’s turn (including your own turn). additional rules cards a player with a depleted deck who needs to draw or reveal cards reshuffles his discard pile to create a new deck, and then draws or reveals the cards he needs. any player may count the cards remaining in any player’s deck, or examine any player’s discard pile, but he may not alter the order of the cards. at the end of each player’s turn and the event phase, all players replenish their hand to 5 cards. through card abilities, a player may draw additional cards. there is no maximum hand size. player elimination when your home realm sustains 20 points worth of damage tokens, you are eliminated from the game. return neutral cards and gold cards to their place of origin. any cities you control are returned to the central play area. any reward cards you control are removed from the game. abilities abilities on unit and tactic cards are always optional and can only be used once per card per round. when played means the ability is triggered at the moment the card is played in combat. some cards require the player to discard a card from his hand or spend influence in order to activate the ability. resolution means the ability is triggered during the resolution step of combat. the attacker resolves all of his resolution abilities first, the defender resolves all of his resolution abilities. end of combat means the ability is triggered during the end of combat step of combat, before cards are sent to the discard pile or returned to their place of origin. action means the ability is triggered during the perform actions step of a player’s turn. these abilities cannot be used during combat or during another player’s turn. destroying & wounding units ‘destroy’ means that the card is returned to its place of origin: either in a player’s barracks (faction-specific units) or in the central play area (neutral units). a unit destroyed during combat is immediately removed from combat. the owning player does not count its strength toward his total for this combat. a destroyed city is returned to the central play area and is considered a neutral city until a player secures it again. ‘wound’ only occurs during combat and means that the card will be destroyed after combat is resolved. rotate the card sideways. wounded units still add their combat value to a player’s strength total, but they are destroyed during the end of combat step. a wounded unit cannot be wounded again. optional rule: custom neutral cards each scenario’s objective card displays the recommended neutral cards for that scenario. however, all players may agree to substitute any number of neutral card types for any other neutral card type with the same influence cost."

black dice icons indicate the lowest result is kept. moving the player moves his car a number of boxes as indicated by the gear shift lever pawn’s position, and may change a number of lanes in his turn depending on his speed. he must move forward and may not u-turn.if the player does not have enough lane changes available, he may spend steering points. each point allows an additional lane change this turn. if he cannot do either he continues in a straight line and may collide with an obstacle or car. collisions if a car runs into an immovable obstacle or rams another car, make a collision test to determine which cars lose structure points, and how many. when a car’s structure point counter reaches the skull position, the car ends its move flipped over on the square it occupied at the time of destruction as a wreck. side collisions and ramming to ram a car from the side, the attacker must move at least one box before the collision. the attacker rolls a die and the ram is successful on 4+. if the box towards which the defender is rammed is empty, the defender is moved there and the attacker continues his move. he may ram again if he has enough movement and lane changes/steering points. if the box towards which the defender is rammed is blocked, the defender is not moved there and the attacker continues his move forward. he may not ram the defender again. whether the ram is successful or not, look up the die result on the table below to determine which car loses a structure point: die result 1 2 3 4 5 6+ destination box empty a a - - d d destination box blocked a a - d d d3 a = attacker, d = defender, d3 = defender + 3rd car front and rear collisions to run into another car (defender) in front—intentionally or unintentionally—the moving car (attacker) must have at least one box of movement left. his movement ends immediately and the player rolls as many dice as he has boxes left to move: each result of 1 or 2: both the attacker and defender lose a structure point. each result of 3: only the defender loses a structure point. collisions with an immovable obstacle a car moving at a speed of 4 or 5 loses 1 structure point in a head-on collision with an immovable obstacle. a car moving at a speed of 18 loses 6 structure points. at a speed of 6-18, refer to the table below. at a speed of 6-10, only count the lowest result from all the rolls, and at a speed of 11-16, only count the highest result: speed 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 16 #dice 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 use lowest result use highest result the result is the number of structure points lost in the collision. if the car is destroyed, return it to the box it occupied immediately before the collision; it is now a wreck. if the car is not destroyed, it makes a free forced lane change. forced lane change a forced lane change occurs as if the player had just spent a steering point to move the car. the car then continues moving normally. a car forced to change lanes to a box occupied by another car must ram from the rear if possible. if this is not possible or fails, the cars must resolve a side collision. the active player rolls as many dice as he had boxes left to move. both cars lose a structure point for each result of 1 or 2. once the collision is resolved the active car’s turn ends immediately. wrecks a player whose car passes into a box containing a wreck rolls a die. on a result of 1, 2 or 3 his car loses a structure point. the collision rules do not apply. winner the winner is the player with the first car to cross the finish line. there is only one winner."

check again. place the 5 support tokens belonging to the absent samurai beside the village, face up. at the beginning of your turn (before applying the penalty on your last raider card), you can decide to use 1 or more of these support tokens. add the effect of each token you use to your own talent for the current round. then turn over the corresponding token: each can only be used once per game. game round the game lasts 3 rounds. during each round, players take turns in clockwise order, until the raider stack has been used up or until all players have dropped out of the round (passed). on your turn, carry out the following steps in order: a) apply the battle penalty if you have raider cards to the right of your samurai board, you must apply the penalty depicted on the last card laid there. if there should be no more raider cards lying to the right of your samurai board, or if there is no penalty depicted on the last card laid, nothing happens: continue with the second step of your turn. if you are unable to apply the raider’s penalty, you receive a wound instead. b) carry out an action you must carry out exactly one of the following 3 actions: 1 . fight if (and only if) you choose to fight, turn over the topmost raider card on the stack; this is your current opponent. you must decide whether to confront the raider or defend against the raider. confront: place the raider card to the right place the raider card to the right of your samurai board. if there are already 1 or more cards there, then place them overlapping in such a way that the values of all cards are still visible. these cards form the combat line.now move your samurai meeple on your battle track, so that its position matches the total of the values shown on the raider cards in your combat line. how the total compares to your kiai value determines what happens next: if the total is less than your kiai, you stand your ground (nothing further happens). if the total is equal to your kiai, you may immediately activate your kiai. if the total is greater than your kiai, you are overcome by the raiders: immediately remove 1 village barricade. defend: place the raider card to the left the only raider cards you can place to the left of your board are those bearing a hat, farm, or doll symbol. if the raider cards bears one of these symbols, and you do not already have a raider with that same symbol to the left of your board, you may defend, placing that card to the left of your board. otherwise you must confront the raider. you do not modify your battle track. therefore, you may have a maximum of 3 cards to the left of your samurai board. their symbols must be visible at all times. the position of the samurai meeple on the battle track always corresponds to the sum of the raider cards in the combat line. each time a card is added to or subtracted from the right side of the samurai board, the position of the samurai meeple must be altered accordingly. 2. support hand your support token to a samurai of your choice. then, without looking at the card, move the topmost card from the raider stack onto the intruder stack. the samurai who received your support token benefits from your talent on their next turn. after completing their next turn, they must hand the token back to you—regardless of whether they used it. a samurai can receive support from several fellow players (during their next turn they can benefit from all the corresponding talents). 3. pass if you decide not to participate in any further combat for the remainder of the round, lay your samurai meeple down on the space of the battle track where it is currently standing. for the rest of the round, you are treated as though you were no longer in the game. you can neither receive cards, nor get rid of any; and you no longer suffer the penalty from the last raider card in your combat line. if your samurai meeple is already past your kiai value (on the flame), you must pass.end of a round the current round ends immediately if the last card of the raider stack is drawn and played or all players have passed. when all players have passed, place the remaining cards of the raider stack on top of the intruder stack. at the end of a round players carry out the following steps in order: 1. each samurai who has not placed any card with the hat symbol on their defense side (to the left of their board) sustains a wound. 2. each samurai who has not placed any card with the farm symbol on their defense side (to the left of their board) removes 1 farmstead from the village. if you are playing the game at hard or heroic level, the penalty on the reverse side of the farmstead token must be applied. immediately remove a random family token from the village. immediately remove another farmstead, and apply its penalty. immediately remove a barricade. if there are none, destroy a farmstead instead and apply its penalty. a random player immediately sustains a wound. 3. every samurai who does not have a card with the family symbol on their defense side (to the left of their board) removes a random family token from the village. afterwards, the corresponding bonus is given for each family remaining in the village. a random player removes the wound token from their board. add a barricade to the village. the number of barricades in the game cannot exceed the number in use at the start of the game. place the top card of the intruder stack on the discard pile. 4. reveal cards one-by-one from the intruder stack. for each card showing flames at the bottom right, remove 1 barricade from the village. if there are no barricades to remove, a farmstead is destroyed instead (and if you are playing the game at hard or heroic level, then the penalty on the reverse side of the token must be applied). end of the first round: if at least 1 farmstead and 1 family remain, the players begin the next round. collect together all cards used in this round. the players place their samurai meeples on space 0 on their battle tracks again. for each player, add 1 randomly drawn lieutenant card (value 5) to the plunderer cards. shuffle these together to form the raider stack for the next round. end of the second round: if at least 1 farmstead and 1 family remain, the players begin the next round. collect together all cards used in this round. the players place their samurai meeples on space 0 on their battle tracks again. for each player, add 1 randomly drawn boss card (value 6) to the plunderer and lieutenant cards. shuffle these together to form the new raider stack for the next round. end of the third round: if at least 1 farmstead and one family remain in the village, the players win. the last active player (the one who drew the last card, or the last one to pass) gives the active player marker to the player to their left. this player begins the next round. talents your samurai’s unique talent is depicted in the upper- left corner of your samurai board. you can use it on all the raider cards you draw, but you are not required to use it. kiai your samurai’s kiai is depicted in the bottom area of the samurai board. whenever you reach your kiai value exactly, then you can activate your kiai immediately as follows: 1. use your kiai’s effect, if you like. 2. regardless of whether you used your kiai’s effect, remove the first card from your combat line (the one directly on the table), and place it face up on the discard pile. then update your battle track accordingly. therefore you might be able to re-activate your kiai on a future turn. you can use the active player marker when a samurai uses their kiai, so that you do not lose track of whose turn it is (though it is possible for a player to activate their kiai without it actually being their turn). wounds a samurai may sustain wounds during the round, or at the end of a round if they did not protect the peasants. wound marker stay on your board from round to round. wounds bear these consequences: 1st wound: place a wound token face up on your samurai board, which will still be human side up. 2nd wound: return the wound token from your board to the supply. then turn your samurai board over to the animal side. your board will still be between the raider cards to its left and right. set the meeple on your battle track, according to the total value of your battle line. your board stays turned to the animal side for the rest of the game. 3rd wound: place a wound token on your samurai board, which will now be animal side up. 4th wound: the samurai dies and the game is lost.the raiders’ penalties 1 barricade is destroyed (remove a barricade token from the village). if there are no barricades to remove, then a farmstead is destroyed, instead. you sustain a wound. the top card of the raider stack is placed, unseen, on the intruder stack. during your turn, you may not place raider cards to the left of your samurai board. during your turn, you may not carry out the support action; however, you can still receive support from other players. the player sitting to the left of you draws a raider card and adds it to their combat line. then they modify their battle track accordingly. the player sitting to the right of you draws a raider card and adds it to their combat line, then modifies their battle track accordingly. for these last two, the samurai talents cannot be applied; it is a penalty card. but adding a penalty card might enable a player to activate their kiai as normal. the bosses’ penalties during your turn, you must choose the pass action. draw a random card from the discard pile, and shuffle it into the raider stack. during your turn, you can neither use your talent nor any of the support tokens in your possession. you must select a card from the left side of your board and put it on the discard pile. some bosses have 2 penalty symbols: both penalties must be applied, but the order in which they are carried out is up to the player. if you are unable to apply a raider’s penalty, you sustain a wound instead. scoring if they are victorious, players can score their performance: 1 point per farmstead remaining (max: 6 points). 1 point per family remaining (max: 3 points).1 point if none of the samurai have a wound (it does not matter whether they are human or animal). the points should be supplemented by a grade: easy level: no addition. normal level: add 1 + symbol (example: 7+).hard level: add 2 + symbols (example: 10++). heroic level: add 3 + symbols (example: 8+++)."

your turn, do the following in order: 1. place your action token on a different section of your player mat than where it was on your previous turn. 2. take the top-row action on that section (optional). 3. take the bottom-row action on that section (optional). so you may take a single action, both actions (from top to bottom), or neither action (still move your action token). you may use resources gained from the top-row action to pay for the bottom-row action. you may also complete an objective card any time on your turn. the costs (red boxes) and benefits (green boxes) on your player mat are shown by the number of empty spaces before the action is taken. when taking an action, first pay the cost, then gain the benefit (or only part of the benefit, if you wish). you must be able to pay the full cost to take the action. you may only spend resources from territories you currently control. after you’ve completed your turn, the next person in clockwise order takes their turn. top-row actions move do one of the following: move: move 1 different unit per (character, worker, or mech) from one territory to an adjacent territory. gain coin: gain $1 per . units may pick up and drop off any number of resource tokens during a move action. mechs can transport any number of resource tokens and workers (not your character); this does not count as movement for the workers. units may not move across river or onto lakes unless they have a special ability that allows them to do so. all territories with the tunnel icon are considered adjacent to each other. if your character or mech move into a territory controlled by an opponent’s workers (and no other units), its movement ends (even if a mech ability allows it to move further). each of the opponent’s workers on that territory immediately retreats to their faction’s home base, leaving behind any resource tokens. you lose 1 popularity for each worker that was forced to retreat. your workers cannot move by themselves into territories controlled by an opponent’s workers. any unit may move into a territory controlled only by a structure. the player controlling the unit now controls the territory. if your character and/or mech move into a territory controlled by an opponent’s character and/or mech, their movement ends (even if you have a mech ability that allows them to move further). the opponent still temporarily controls that territory. if any of your mechs or your character share a territory with an opponent’s character or mechs, combat happens. your workers cannot move by themselves into or out of territories controlled by an opponent’s characters and/or mechs. you may not use a move action to move any unit from the board into any home base (including yours). if you move your character into a territory with an encounter token, their movement ends and they cannot move again this turn. after resolving all combats, if your character is still there, discard the token and resolve the encounter. there is no limit to the number of same-faction units that can be in a territory. bolster pay the $1 cost and gain one of the following: power: increase your power on the power track by 1 per . combat card(s): draw 1 combat card per . trade pay the $1 cost and gain one of the following: resources: gain any 2 resource tokens (any combination of wood, oil, food, and/or metal) and place them on any territories you control with at least 1 worker on them. you cannot do this if all your workers are on your home base. popularity: increase your popularity on the popularity track by 1 per . produce pay the cost (shown on all exposed red rectangles before taking the action), choose up number of different territories you control, and all workers on those territories may produce. each worker may produce 1 resource token: place the token on the territory where it was produced. if a worker produces another worker, after paying the cost, pick up the leftmost worker of the produce action on your player mat and place it on the village. once you have a worker on the board it cannot return to your player mat. terrain produces terrain produces mountain metal village worker farm food lake – tundra oil factory – forest wood any number of resource tokens or workers can be on a territory, and there is no limit to the number of resource tokens (if necessary, place a multiplier token next to resource tokens). bottom-row actions most of the bottom-row actions give you at least 1 coin when you pay to take that action. you may choose not to take the coins. if you ‘complete’ a bottom-row action, you may continue to pay the cost of the action to gain the coins (and the recruit bonus, if applicable). each of the bottom-row actions has a recruit ongoing bonus (green circle). if it is exposed, it rewards a player when they or adjacent opponents take this action. upgrade pay the cost, take a technology cube from any green box on your player mat, and place it on any empty red box with bracketed borders. red boxes with solid black borders are off limits for upgrades. deploy pay the cost, choose any mech on your faction mat, and place it on any territory you control with at least 1 worker on it (not on a lake, even if it has an ability that allows it to move onto lakes). from now on, your characters and all mechs (not your workers) gain the ability on the faction mat that was under the mech miniature. build pay the cost, take any structure from your player mat, and place it on any territory you control with at least 1 worker on it. only 1 structure can be built on each territory. opponents can’t use your structure abilities; you always get the abilities even if you don’t control the territories they are on. a territory with one of your structures on it is under your control even if you have no units there. if an opponent’s unit is on a territory with your structure, they control that territory. structures cannot be destroyed or moved. you may build on the factory territory. your home base isn’t a territory and you cannot build there. you can’t build structures on lakes.the benefit revealed by removing a structure from your player mat is an additional benefit you will gain when taking the top-row action directly above it in future. monument: whenever you take the bolster action, also gain 1 popularity. mill: whenever you take the produce action, the mill may produce as if it were 1 worker. if there are workers on the mill’s territory, they may also produce. mine: the mine acts as a tunnel that only you can use. you may move units to and from your mine as if it was a tunnel (even if an opponent controls the territory the mine is on). this is an ongoing ability associated with all unit movement. armory: whenever you take the trade action, also gain 1 power. end-game bonus at the end of the game, players gains coins for achieving the goals shown on the structure bonus tile that was randomly selected during setup. you gain the bonus even if you don’t control the territories the structures are on. enlist pay the cost, take a recruit token from any section on your player mat, place it on any open recruit one-time bonus space on your faction mat, and immediately gain the depicted bonus. the token remains there permanently. the 4 one-time bonuses are: gain 2 power; gain 2 coins; gain 2 popularity; and draw 2 combat cards. in addition to the one-time bonus, each recruit gives you a recruit ongoing bonus related to the action from which you selected the recruit token (the bonus in the circle). for the rest of the game, whenever you or the player to your immediate left or right (shown in the icon in the red circle) take the bottom-row action in the section of the player mat from which the recruit was taken, you gain the specified bonus. top-row actions or a similar action on a factory card do not count. if more than one player would gain a recruit ongoing bonus, the active player goes first, followed by the player on their left, then the player on their right. if one of those players places their 6th star as a result, the game immediately ends. you must announce when you take bottom-row actions so adjacent players know to check for recruit ongoing bonuses. in a 2 player game, whenever your opponent takes an action that would give you a recruit ongoing bonus, you only gain it once. mech abilities rusviet riverwalk: your character and mechs can move across rivers onto farms and villages. township: for the purposes of move actions for your character and mechs, villages you control and the factory are considered to be adjacent to each other. people’s army: in combat where you have at least 1 worker, you may play 1 additional combat card. you still require a character or mech to participate in combat. speed: your character and mechs may move 1 additional territory per move action. if any of those units move onto a territory containing an opponent’s character, mech, or worker, their movement ends and they cannot move again this turn. moving from 1 tunnel to another still counts as 1 move, so with this ability you could move an additional territory before or after moving through a tunnel. your mechs can pick up or drop off resources and workers in the middle of a move action when they have this ability. crimea riverwalk: your character and mechs can move across rivers onto farms and tundra. wayfare: your character and mechs may move from a territory or home base to any inactive faction’s (any faction not currently in the game) home base or your own regardless of the distance. scout: before you engage in combat, steal 1 of the opponent’s combat cards at random and add it to your hand. you may do this once per combat, not once per unit. speed: your character and mechs may move 1 additional territory per move action (see rusviet listing for details). nordic riverwalk: your character and mechs can move across rivers onto forests and mountains. seaworthy: your character and mechs treat lakes the same as other territories for movement: they can move to and from lakes and retreat onto adjacent lakes (you may still also retreat those units to your home base). if a mech transports workers onto a lake (during a move action or when retreating) or if a character or mech transports resources onto a lake, you may not leave those workers or resources on the lake after moving off it, nor may a worker move off the lake without the assistance of the mech. lakes are territories, so if 2 factions have a lake movement ability, combat may happen on a lake. you cannot build a structure or deploy a mech on a lake. artillery: before you engage in combat, you may pay 1 power to force the combating opponent to lose 2 power (adjust the power track). you may do this once per combat, not once per unit. speed: your character and mechs may move 1 additional territory per move action (see rusviet listing for details). polania riverwalk: your character and mechs can move across rivers onto villages and mountains. submerge: your character and mechs can move to and from lakes and move from any lake to another (like tunnels). if a mech transports workers onto a lake or if a character or mech transports resources onto a lake, you may not leave those workers or resources on the lake after moving off it, nor may a worker move off the lake without the assistance of the mech. lakes are territories, so if 2 factions have a lake movement ability, it’s possible for combat to happen on a lake. you cannot build a structure or deploy a mech on a lake. camaraderie: you do not lose popularity when, at any time on your turn, your character or mechs force an opponent’s workers to retreat after combat. speed: your character and mechs may move 1 additional territory per move action (see rusviet listing for details). saxony riverwalk: your character and mechs can move across rivers onto forests and mountains. underpass: for the purposes of move actions for your character and mechs, mountains you control and all tunnels (including your mine if you have one) are considered adjacent to each other. disarm: before you engage in combat on a territory with a tunnel, the combating opponent loses 2 power. this loss of power is reflected on the power track. you may do this once per combat, not once per unit. speed: your character and mechs may move 1 additional territory per move action (see rusviet listing for details).faction abilities rusviet relentless: you may choose the same section on your player mat as the previous turn(s). this also applies to a factory card if you have one. crimea coercion: once per turn, you may spend 1 combat card as if it were any 1 resource token. combat cards are still worth nothing at the end of the game. nordic swim: your workers (only) may move across rivers. polania meander: pick up to 2 options per encounter card. the benefit from the 1st selected option may be used to pay the cost for the 2nd selected option. only 1 encounter card is drawn. saxony dominate: there is no limit to the number of stars you can place from completing objectives or winning combat. you may complete both of your objective cards (you don’t discard the second card after achieving the first), and you are not limited to 2 combat victory stars. combat if, at the end of your move action (after all units have moved but before you take a bottom-row action), if your character and/ or mechs share a territory with an opponent’s character and/or mechs, combat occurs. if this happens on multiple territories, the active player chooses the order in which combats are resolved. if the attacking player has a mech ability that impacts combat, they use that ability first, followed by the defending player. lake battles can happen between mechs with the appropriate abilities: if a mech transporting workers is on a lake and the attacker wins combat, the attacking player loses 1 popularity for each of those workers (they are forced to retreat with the mech to their home base). select power simultaneously and secretly select a number on your power dial (align the number with the icon at the top right). you cannot choose a number higher than the amount of power you currently have on the power track. for each of your units (character and/or mechs) involved in the combat, you may tuck 1 combat card from your hand behind the power dial (even if you select 0 power). reveal both players reveal their power dials and selected combat cards simultaneously. the value from combat cards is a bonus to the power you are spending, as indicated on your dial. the player with highest total power wins the combat (attacker wins ties). both players then pay the amount of power they selected on their dial and discard any combat cards they used faceup. the winner gains (or maintains) control of the territory and all resource tokens on it, and places 1 star in the combat space of the triumph track (if they haven’t already placed 2 stars for combat victories). if the winner was the attacker, they lose 1 popularity for each worker they forced to retreat by initiating and winning combat. if there was an encounter token on the territory and the winner has a character there, discard the token and resolve the encounter.the loser must retreat all of their units (mechs, characters, and workers) from the territory to their home base (the units are picked up and placed on the home base). all resources those units were carrying remain on the territory and are now under the control of the winner. if the loser revealed at least 1 power on the dial or through combat cards, they gain 1 combat card as they retreat. stars each player (with the exception of the saxon player) may gain a maximum of 2 stars for winning combat; but they may engage in future combats after they’ve achieved those stars. if your 6th star is placed but you still have a combat remaining on your turn, the game ends and any units you moved to initiate that combat move back to the territory from whence they came. encounters when you move your character into a territory with an encounter token, their movement ends and they cannot move again this turn. after resolving all combats (but before you take a bottom- row action), if your character is still there, discard the token and resolve the encounter. read the text out loud, then choose one of the options and pay any applicable cost. you must be able to pay any required costs, but you may gain as much of the benefit as you’d like. then discard the card facedown to the bottom of the encounter deck. any resources, structures, mechs, or workers you gain go on the same territory as your character. if a card instructs you to gain something or perform an action, do not pay any additional costs or gain additional benefits beyond those on the card, or trigger any recruit ongoing bonuses. the factory when your move action is finished, after combat if necessary, if your character is on the factory for the first time this game, look through the factory cards on the board and choose one. a factory card is placed next to your player mat and is treated as a 5th section. even if the card does something similar to a section on your player mat, they are independent of one another. all factory cards have a bottom-row move action that allows you to move 1 unit up to 2 times within the same move action. all other normal rules for movement apply. if you have a mine, you may move through the mine with this move action. if you’ve unlocked the speed mech ability, one of your mechs or your character may move up to 3 territories with this action. you may have 1 factory card at most; your selection is permanent. objectives you may reveal a completed objective card during your own turn before or after you complete a top or bottom row action. if you do, place 1 star token on the objective space of the triumph track and discard the card along with your other objective to the bottom of the objective deck. each player (with the exception of the saxon player) may gain a maximum of 1 star for completing objectives. you may wait to reveal your completed objective, but you must meet its requirements at the time you reveal it. alliances and bribes players may make informal agreements. the only tangible objects that may be exchanged are coins (in tournament play, coins may not be exchanged for deals or alliances). you can’t negotiate your way out of a combat that has already begun. agreements made between players are not enforceable.placing stars when you achieve one of the goals on the triumph track, you must place a star on the appropriate space. you cannot lose a star after you’ve placed it. normally, each player may complete each of these goals one time. having a star on a goal does not prevent other players from having a star on that goal. you can’t place more than 6 stars. game end and scoring the game immediately ends when a player places their 6th star token. if the 6th star comes from taking a bottom-row action, gain the primary benefit, the coins, and the recruit ongoing benefit before placing the star. if you have units (characters, mechs, and/or workers) remaining on a territory with an opponent’s units (from a move action), you must undo that portion of your move action, returning the unit(s) to the territory they moved from. if you place a star for total popularity or total power as a recruit bonus on an opponent’s turn, that placement happens after the opponent takes the action in clockwise order and only if that opponent didn’t place their 6th star by taking that action. end-game scoring total the coins you had before the game end was triggered, plus end-game coins, to determine the winner. to determine how many coins you earn for each of the 3 scoring categories, look at your level on the popularity track and pick up coins for that category. delay of game (variant) if a player delays the game (while it is being played) for more than 10 seconds by trying to calculate the final score, they lose 1 popularity. scoring categories coins you accumulated during the game count for end-game scoring. gain coins for every star token you placed during the game. gain coins for every territory you control (including lakes). home bases are not territories. you control each territory where you have a worker, mech or character, or where you have a structure (but no enemy units). at the end of the game, the factory is counted as 3 territories to the player who controls it. gain coins for every 2 resource tokens you control. workers are not resources. you control all resources on territories where you have a character, worker, mech, or a structure not occupied by an opponent’s unit. gain coins based on the number of structure bonuses you received. you gain this bonus even if you don’t control the territories your structures are on. declaring the winner the player with the most coins wins. on a tie, use these tiebreakers (in order): 1. number of workers, mechs, and structures 2. power 3. popularity 4. number of resource tokens controlled 5. number of territories controlled 6. number of star tokens placed on board the winner of the game may write their name up to 2 times on the achievement sheet. this commemorates the first time any player wins under a certain condition."

artillery, 1 infantry, and 1 mounted unit and places them facedown in a single pile as their standing forces. each player takes their lower ranked military tech markers for artillery, infantry, and mounted units, and places them in the area below the appropriate unit deck with 1 stripe sides faceup. then each player takes their aircraft military marker and places it below the aircraft unit deck with the star side facedown. set aside the other military tech markers for now. sort the building markers by type and place them on their spaces. an upgraded building has an arrow next to its name. build the wonder deck by shuffling the ancient, medieval, and modern wonders separately. place the modern wonders facedown on the top space of the wonder market; then place the medieval wonders facedown on top. then place the ancient wonders faceup in the 4 market spaces below the wonder deck. egypt, if playing, receives one of the ancient wonders at random before the rest are placed in the market; one of the medieval wonders is then drawn and replaces it in the market. place the matching wonder marker for each of the 4 faceup wonder cards in the space next to its card. separate and shuffle the culture event cards into ancient (1 column), medieval (2 columns), and modern (3 columns) decks, and place each deck facedown on its space below the culture track at the bottom of the market board. each player takes the culture level marker showing their leader and places it on the start space of the culture track. place 1 of each market resource token per player near the market board, returning extras to the box. each player takes their home map tile and places it faceup in front of them, oriented as indicated in the setup diagram for the number of players. return unused home tiles to the box. shuffle the neutral map tiles and deal them out facedown to form the rest of the map as indicated. return unused neutral map tiles unseen to the box. shuffle the great people markers, the hut markers and the village markers facedown near the market board in separate piles. place the culture, wound, and coin tokens next to the market board in separate piles. place the combat bonus cards and the space flight tech card faceup near the market board along with the disaster markers. choose a first player and give them the first player marker. each player places their capital city marker (unwalled side up) on one of the 4 center squares on their home map tile. the city’s square is the city center, and the adjacent 8 squares are the city outskirts. each player takes bonuses as listed on their civilization sheet: america gains a random great person, placed in the outskirts of their capital at the end of setup. china begins with its capital city marker walled side up. egypt gains a random ancient wonder (already taken from the market board), placed in the outskirts of the player’s capital. germany gains 2 extra infantry units from the market board, adding the units to their standing forces. rome begins governed by republic instead of despotism. russia gains the white russian army figure; when figures are placed on the map, this is also. russia begins governed by communism instead of despotism. each player takes one of their army figures and one of their scout figures and places them (separately or together) in 1 (or 2) of their city outskirts squares (not water squares). each player places their starting tech card faceup in front of them (always in the bottom row of their tech pyramid regardless of the card’s level). if another player learns that tech through any means, the tech is still considered to be its normal level. each player stacks their government cards so that the despotism/ republic card is on top (despotism side faceup), and places the stack on the civilization sheet space. players starting with different governments place the appropriate card faceup on top of their cards. each player counts all of the trade symbols in the 8 squares of their city outskirts and sets the large outer trade dial on their civilization sheet to that total. set the small inner economy dial to 0 (or more if the player receives coins from a map square or great person during setup). each player places 1 city marker, their remaining 5 army figures, and their remaining scout figure by their civilization sheet. the other city marker is set aside until the player learns the irrigation tech and may add it to these available items. each game turn is composed of 5 phases performed in the following order. 1. start of turn pass the first player marker to the left (except on the first turn). starting with the new first player, each player performs any start of turn actions, builds any new cities, and changes governments if desired. building new cities if you have fewer built cities than your maximum number of cities (2 normally, 3 if you have researched the irrigation tech), you may build 1 or more new cities. you must have a scout figure in each square you wish to place a city marker in. in addition, the square cannot be a water square; there must be 8 revealed squares adjacent to the square; it cannot be adjacent to a hut or village token or an enemy figure (army or scout); and it must be 3 squares or more away from any other city marker (including diagonals). return the scout to your civilization sheet, then place a city marker on the space, unwalled side up. only squares in a city’s outskirts provide icons and resources. any friendly figures in the square where a city is built (besides the sacrificed scout) are immediately moved to an adjacent square that they can legally end their movement in. a city generates trade and production in the same turn it is built. changing governments if you unlock a new form of government during the research phase, you may change to that government during the start of turn phase of the following turn. place the corresponding card, appropriate side faceup, on top of your government deck. if you wish to change to a different government on any turn other than the turn immediately after unlocking that government, you must first change to the anarchy transitional government. if you are in anarchy, you may change to any other government you know during the start of turn phase of the next turn after entering anarchy. any ongoing benefits from a government only last while your civilization continues to be ruled by that government.2. trade each player (simultaneously if desired) collects trade; then all players may negotiate and/or trade. collecting trade each player increases their trade dial by the total trade symbols in the city outskirts of all their cities. scouts may gather trade symbols in their squares. a square occupied by enemy figures does not produce trade. negotiating and trading players may negotiate and/or trade among themselves. trades may include an exchange of any or all non-binding promises; points of trade; unspent culture tokens; resource tokens from the market or from hut/village tokens; and culture event cards. a player who exceeds their culture hand size as a result of a trade must immediately discard down to their hand size. items not listed may not be given or traded to another player unless specifically allowed by a card or ability. 3. city management starting with the first player, each player takes 1 city action with each of their cities. a. produce a figure, unit, building, or wonder the city can produce 1 item with a production cost equal to or less than the total production symbols in its outskirts. the entire production cost for an item must come from the city producing it. excess production cannot be saved. for every 3 points by which you reduce your trade dial, you may boost the production of one of your cities by 1 for a single turn. you may do this as often as desired. scouts may gather production symbols in their squares. a square occupied by enemy figures does not generate production. producing figures you may produce an army or scout figure if you have at least 1 unbuilt figure of that type and can meet its production cost. take one of the figures from next to your civilization sheet and place it in the outskirts of the city that produced it. figures may not be placed in a water square unless you have learned a tech that allows your figures to end their movement in water. figures may be placed in the same square as other friendly figures, but the total figures in a square cannot exceed your stacking limit. army figures cost 4 each, and are the only figures that can fight battles and explore huts and villages. scout figures cost 6 each, and may be used to build new cities or to gather extra trade, production, or other resources. they cannot enter squares containing huts or villages and are killed immediately if attacked by an army (unless they have a friendly army escorting them). producing units unit cards represent an army’s specific units. to produce a unit, ensure the city can meet its production cost, then draw a unit card at random from the appropriate deck and add it to your standing forces pile. if a unit deck is empty, units of that type are not available until some are killed and returned to the deck. aircraft units require the flight tech to be produced. if you reach units that have been returned faceup to the bottom of a deck when drawing, turn the deck over and shuffle it. to determine the production cost of a unit, look at the market board to see how advanced the units of that type are: artillery, infantry, or mounted units, cost per unit: rank 1: 5; rank 2: 7; rank 3: 9; rank 4: 11. aircraft units always cost 12 each (once unlocked).producing buildings to produce a building, you must know a tech that unlocks it. its cost is on the tech that unlocks it and on the market board. buildings are limited to the available components. once all of a certain type have been produced, no more can be produced until one of that type is destroyed. a building must be placed in the outskirts of the city that produced it. buildings are restricted to certain types of terrain, as noted on the market board. any number of a given type of building may be built in a city as long as suitable terrain exists. building names separated by a slash are the basic and upgraded forms of the same building type, on the front and back of the same marker. once a building marker is placed on a square, its icons replace any on the square. a water square with a harbor placed in it is still considered to be water for the purposes of movement. limited buildings (star) are restricted to 1 per city. city walls may be built using the masonry tech and are treated like any other building, except they are considered to be in the city’s center. flip the city marker to its walled side. only 1 city walls may be built per city. producing wonders to produce one of the wonders faceup in the market, pay the production cost on its wonder card (or the discounted cost if you know the specific tech listed). the entire cost must be paid by a single city. place the wonder card faceup in front of you and the wonder token in the outskirts of the relevant city. then draw a new wonder from the wonder deck and add it to the market, with its corresponding wonder marker next to the card. wonders may be placed on any terrain except for water and are restricted to 1 per city. a city may contain both a wonder and 1 limited building. abilities affecting buildings do not affect wonders unless explicitly stated. certain tech cards allow a player to obsolete a wonder, negating its special ability for the rest of the game. replacing buildings and wonders you may replace one of your existing buildings or wonders when placing a new building or wonder (a wonder may replace a building and vice versa). the new building or wonder must be able to be legally placed once the old one is removed. you may not replace another player’s building or wonder. old buildings are returned to the market. old wonders and their cards may not be rebuilt for the rest of the game. b. devote to the arts take 1 culture token from the stockpile, plus 1 additional token per culture icon that appears in the outskirts of the city. scouts may gather culture symbols in their squares. a square occupied by enemy figures does not produce culture. spending culture any time during your city management phase, you may choose to spend some or all of your culture tokens to advance your culture level marker up the culture track on the market board. pay the cost listed on the space your marker is entering, move your marker, then claim the reward shown on the space. higher up, advancing on the track costs trade as well as culture. both costs must be paid in full for each space advanced (trade is spent from your trade dial). you may advance as many spaces up the culture track each turn as you can afford. multiple markers may occupy the same space.the 3 different types of spaces are: culture event: draw a culture event card from the culture event deck pictured on the space and secretly add it to your hand. if you exceed your culture hand size, immediately discard down to your hand size before any culture event cards can be played. great people: draw a great person marker at random from the facedown pile. you may then either immediately place the great person in a city or hold it in reserve. culture victory: you immediately win the game (culture victory). culture event cards culture event cards are kept secret in a player’s hand. your maximum hand size starts at 2, but may be increased by tech. they may only be played during the phase indicated on the card. read the title and the effect and then perform the effect before discarding the card. discarded culture event cards are placed faceup at the bottom of the appropriate deck. if you reach a card that is faceup, turn the deck over and shuffle it to create a new culture event deck. great people a new great people marker may be immediately placed in the outskirts of one of your cities, on any terrain except water. they replace any building or wonder they are placed on. a great person marker that is replaced (by having a building, wonder, or another great person placed in their square), is held in reserve and returned to your civilization sheet instead of being discarded (they have no effect when not on the map). during the start of turn phase of any turn, you may place any great people on your civilization sheet back on the map as above. c. harvest a resource to take this action, the city must have a square with that resource’s icon in its outskirts. take 1 resource token of that type from the market board and place it on your civilization sheet. you cannot harvest a resource if the market is out of that resource, and a city may only harvest 1 resource per action. resources power resource abilities on tech cards. each time you want to use a resource ability, pay its cost by spending the appropriate resource(s). scouts may harvest resources in their squares. a square occupied by enemy figures cannot be harvested. 4. movement starting with the first player, each player moves any or all of their figures (armies and scouts), one at a time, up to a number of squares equal to their civilization’s travel speed. a civilization’s travel speed starts at 2, but may be increased by learning tech such as horseback riding. figures cannot move diagonally. a figure that has begun its move must complete it before any other figure may move. you may move several figures as a group if they all begin this phase in the same square. you may never have more figures in a single square than your stacking limit. the stacking limit starts at 2, but may be increased by learning tech such as masonry. at the start of the game, figures cannot enter water squares, but acquiring certain tech can allow your figures to do so. the navigation tech allows a player’s figures to cross water but not make any movement that would result in ending their movement in a water square. certain tech cards, such as sailing, allow your figures to both move through and end their movement on water squares. unexplored map tiles a facedown map tile cannot be moved onto or crossed for any reason, nor can the effects of any tech or culture event card cross or affect any of its squares.you may discover (turn faceup) a facedown map tile by spending 1 square of movement when one of your figures is orthogonally adjacent to the tile. orient the tile so that the arrow points away from the tile that the figure is on. draw 1 random hut marker place it facedown, without looking at it, on each square with a hut icon on the map tile. draw 1 random village marker and place it facedown, without looking at it, on each square with a village icon. exploring huts and villages scout figures cannot enter a square with a hut or village marker. an army figure that enters a square with a hut or village marker immediately ends its movement and explores the hut or village. if the marker is a hut, look at it, then place it facedown on your civilization sheet. the resources on the back of hut markers may be spent like resource tokens taken from the market, but they are returned to the box after being spent. if the marker is a village,the player to the left of the invading player becomes the barbarian player and draws 1 artillery, 1 infantry, and 1 mounted unit from the respective decks (if one or more of the decks are depleted, make up the difference from one of the other decks, as chosen by the barbarian player). these units are barbarians and are kept separate from the barbarian player’s own units. a battle then takes place between the barbarian player’s barbarian units (the defender) and the invading player. barbarian units are always rank 1. if the invading player wins, they look at the village marker. if it shows a great person icon, they discards the village marker and then gains a random great person. otherwise, the village marker shows a resource and is placed facedown on the player’s civilization sheet, where it acts like a hut marker. if the invading player loses, the army figure that entered the square (or the entire group of figures) is killed and is returned to the player’s civilization sheet. enemy figures scouts cannot enter a square with enemy figures. an army that enters a square with enemy figures immediately ends its move. if the square contains only enemy scouts, the scouts are immediately killed and the attacking player collects loot as though they had won a battle. if the square contains at least 1 enemy army, a battle occurs. if the square contains a mix of both enemy armies and scouts, a battle occurs, but if the losing side in the battle has any scouts in the square, they are killed along with the armies; loot is then collected as normal. friendly and enemy cities a player may move their figures through their own city centers, but they may not end any figure’s movement in their city center. scouts may enter enemy city outskirts, but they cannot enter enemy city centers. armies may enter enemy city outskirts, and may also enter an enemy city center—but this immediately results in an attack on the city. 5. research simultaneously, each player may learn 1 new tech by spending trade, then add their newly learned tech to their tech pyramid. you must meet the minimum trade cost for the tech and have a legal space in your civilization’s tech pyramid. then place the chosen tech card facedown in your tech pyramid. once all players have chosen their tech cards for the turn, all researched tech cards are revealed simultaneously. tech learned by a player only applies to that player. you need at least 6 trade to research a level i tech, as indicated on the dial by the ‘i’ that replaces the number 6. it costs an additional 5 trade for each level thereafter. researching a tech spends all of your remaining trade. however you may retain 1 trade for each coin you possess (this never increases your current trade).the tech pyramid level i tech cards may always be legally placed in your tech pyramid, forming its bottom row. when you learn a level ii tech, it must be placed above 2 level i tech cards already in your pyramid. level iii tech cards must be placed above 2 level ii tech cards in their pyramid, and so on. tech card abilities unlocking units, buildings, and governments: when you learn a tech showing a new unit type, building, or government, you immediately unlock the ability to produce that unit or building or to change to that government. at the start of the game, all figures, only the 3 basic unit types (artillery, infantry, and mounted), and the despotism government are unlocked. upgrading units: when you learn a tech with a unit upgrade on it, check to see if you already know a better upgrade for that unit type. if not, find the military tech marker for the improved unit type and place it below the appropriate unit deck on the market board to show that your units of that type have been upgraded (or flip the current marker over if the new rank is on the back). rank 4 is marked with a star. all units of that type that you have already produced are immediately upgraded. once you have upgraded a unit, you must now pay the higher cost to produce new units of that type. upgrading buildings: some buildings have a basic and an upgraded form (on the front and back of the same markers). on the market board, upgraded buildings have an arrow next to their names. when you learn a tech unlocking an upgraded building, immediately flip over any of the corresponding basic buildings that you’ve already produced in your cities. once you have unlocked the upgraded version of a building, you can no longer produce the basic version, and must now produce the higher-cost building. you do not need to know the tech that unlocks the basic building in order to learn the tech that unlocks its upgraded form. resource abilities: require resource tokens to be spent. each has a picture of the resource or resources required to use it (a question mark means any resource of your choice); the phase in which the ability may be used; and the actual ability. each given resource ability may only be used once per turn, regardless of how many resource tokens a player has. if a player knows several techs with similar resource abilities, then each may be used once per turn. other abilities can be granted by tech cards; see the icon key. coins and economic power players track their coins on their economy dials. coins do not allow you to keep trade after any event other than researching a tech. therefore, your trade can still be reduced below your number of coins when spending trade to rush production or when trade is taken after the loss of a battle. coins on the map coins gained from squares on the map are only kept as long as the player retains control of the square (i.e., the square is contained in the outskirts of one of the player’s cities or one of the player’s scouts remains in the square to gather from it). if an enemy figure blockades the square containing the coin, it is lost while the enemy figure remains there. if a building granting a coin to a player is destroyed, the coin is lost. coin tokens coin tokens placed on a tech card as a reward for accomplishing a certain task are treated just like coins on the map, except that there is a maximum number of times a given task will provide a coin token. coin tokens advance the economy dial when gained and cannot be lost.scout gathering each turn, beginning the turn after it was placed on the map, a scout gathers the contents of the square it occupies. the player declares which of their cities the scout is ‘sending’ the square to during the start of turn phase, and all of the icons in that square (including trade, production, culture, coins, and resources) are then considered to be in that city’s outskirts for the rest of the turn. if you have a scout in the outskirts of an enemy city on top of a building or wonder, then you both deny your opponent the icons and/or resources in that square, and may also send them home to one of your cities. consequently, the city benefits from any trade, production, or other icons in the square for the turn. blockades a square in a city’s outskirts that contains 1 or more enemy figures (scouts or armies) does not generate production, trade, culture, coins, or resources for the city’s owner. a square may be blockaded even if it contains a building or a great person. while an enemy figure remains in the same square as a wonder’s marker, the special ability on the wonder’s card cannot be used and the culture produced by its marker cannot be collected. buildings, wonders, great people, and scouts cannot be placed in a blockaded square after being produced. army figures may be placed in a blockaded square, but doing so immediately results in a battle, with the blockading player as the defender. a scout may gather icons in a blockaded square in the outskirts of an enemy city. in this case, the square is considered to be a part of the city the scout is sending it to for the turn rather than the city being blockaded. obsoleting wonders certain techs (monarchy and gunpowder) allow a player to obsolete a wonder. when a wonder is obsoleted, turn its wonder card facedown, but leave its wonder marker on the map. the wonder’s special ability is negated and cannot be used for the rest of the game. however, the wonder marker still produces culture when the city it is in is devoted to the arts. winning the game culture victory: as soon as a player advances to the culture victory space on the market board, they win the game. tech victory: when a player researches the level 5 space flight tech, they win the game. the fewest level i tech cards a player must know to reach level v is five (and a minimum of 15 techs overall is required for a tech victory). economic victory: when a player accumulates 15 coins on their economic dial, they win the game. coins are either gained from squares on the map and building, or from certain techs. military victory: a player who conquers another player’s capital city wins the game. advanced tie-breaker variant on a military victory, the game ends immediately and that player wins. if a player completes a culture, economic, or technology victory, the rest of the turn is played out. after the end of the turn, every player who has completed a non-military victory (remembering that military victories instantly win the game) calculates their victory score, as follows: victory score = number of learned technologies + number of spaces advanced on culture track + number of coins the player with the highest victory score wins the game. in the event that 2 or more players are still tied, they share the victory.turn summary 1. start of turn pass the first player marker clockwise. in player order, each player may: perform start of turn actions build new cities replace scout figure in a legal square with an unwalled city. change government first change to anarchy government if you did not unlock the new government last turn. 2. trade each player increases their trade dial by the total trade in the city outskirts of all their cities. all players may make deals to exchange unspent culture tokens, culture event cards, resource tokens from the market or from hut/ village tokens; non-binding promises, and/or points of trade. 3. city management in player order, each player takes 1 city action with each of their cities. at any time you may choose to spend some or all of your culture tokens to advance your culture level marker. city actions build a figure, unit, building, or wonder city must pay the production cost from in its outskirts. for every 3 points off your trade dial, you may boost 1 city’s production by 1. army figures: 4; scout figures: 6. artillery, infantry, or mounted units, cost per unit: rank 1: 5; rank 2: 7; rank 3: 9; rank 4: 11; aircraft: 12 (once unlocked). devote city to the arts gain 1 culture , plus 1 extra per in that city’s outskirts. harvest a resource gain 1 resource token from the market board if that matching resource icon is in the city’s outskirts. 4. movement in player order, each player moves any or all of their figures (armies and scouts), one at a time, up to a number of squares equal to their civilization’s travel speed (no diagonals). exploration pay 1 square of movement to flip adjacent facedown tile; place random hut and village markers. army figures entering a hut or village square must end movement and either take hut marker and resources, or attack barbarian village. battles occur when an army enters a square with enemy figures. armies may explore huts and villages by moving onto them (if they do so, or join battle, their movement ends). scouts cannot enter huts or villages. a scout that enters a battle is immediately killed. if accompanied by an army, a scout is only killed if the army figures die. 5. research simultaneously, each player may research 1 new tech by paying the tech’s minimum cost, then adding the tech to a legal spot in their tech pyramid. researching reduces your trade dial to 0, plus 1 for each coin you have on your economy dial (trade cannot increase).tech card icons and abilities unlock building allows you to build the pictured building for the listed cost. unlock government allows you to change your civilization to the listed government type. this is free if done the turn after it is unlocked, otherwise you must first change your government to anarchy. increase culture hand size increases your culture hand size by 1 card. multiple techs with this ability are cumulative. constant ability permanently grants you the listed ability, to be used as often as you like unless otherwise stated. upgrade building grey arrow to the left of the building’s name. allows you to build the pictured building for the listed cost, and upgrades all buildings you already own of a certain type (see market board) to that type of building. upgrade unit upgrades all unit cards of the indicated type to the listed rank. units never decrease in rank, and ranks may be skipped. gain coin you gain 1 coin when the tech is learned. resource ability allows you to spend the pictured resource to activate the listed ability during the stated phase of the turn. resource abilities may only be used once per turn. tech card resources incense iron silk spy uranium wheat any scouts build cities: sacrifice a scout to build a city in its square. you must have an unbuilt city, and the scout must be at least 3 spaces away from any other city, and 2 away from any hut, village, or enemy figure. it cannot be in water, adjacent to the map edge, or adjacent to any unrevealed squares. gather: each scout adds the icons of the space it is in to one of its player’s cities (that player’s choice) each turn. combat when an army moves into a square containing a village marker, an enemy army, or an enemy city, a battle takes place. the player whose army is entering the square is the attacker, and the player whose figure or city is being attacked is the defender (if a village is being attacked, the player to the attacker’s left becomes the defender). 1. assembling the battle force the attacker and defender each shuffle their standing forces and randomly draw a number of unit cards equal to their battle hand size. battle hand size starts at 3 and may be increased as follows: +2 for each friendly army in the square beyond the first +1 if governed by fundamentalism +3 if defending a city or capital a side of a unit card lists its unit name, military rank, strength value, trump symbol, and unit type. you only use the side corresponding to the rank of your matching military tech marker. you may wish to turn your cards so the top edge is the one you are using, as indicated by the unit’s rank. your battle force cards are held in hand and kept secret from your opponent until played. you should always try to keep the number of units in your standing forces at or above your expected battle hand size. also, having too many units reduces your chances of drawing the units you really want in battle. 2. calculating combat bonuses players look to see if either side has any combat bonuses. the player with the highest combat bonus takes the combat bonus card and turns it so that it is set to their combat bonus minus their opponent’s combat bonus. available combat bonuses are as follows: +2 for every barracks the player has built +4 for every academy the player has built +4 for every great general the player has on the map +6 if defending a non-capital city +12 if defending a capital city +4 if defending a walled capital or non-capital city (stacks with either of the 2 other city bonuses) every +4 in combat bonuses is about equivalent to 1 unit. 3. engaging in battle starting with the defender, then alternating back and forth, each player must play a unit from their battle force faceup on the table between them until both players have played all of the units in their battle forces. if the attacker is attacking a walled city, the attacker must play the first unit rather than the defender. the first unit played in battle creates the first front. after that, each time a player plays a unit, they must either start a new front or attack an existing enemy front (if any exist to attack). a unit played without attacking another is starting a new front. the new unit remains in play until killed or until the end of the battle. there can never be more than 1 unit in a front. to attack an existing enemy front, place your unit card in front of a faceup enemy unit already played. the 2 unit cards then immediately attack each other. each deals wounds equal to its strength to the other unit. a unit that suffers wounds equal to its strength is immediately killed and returned faceup to the bottom of the unit deck it originally came from. a surviving unit has wound tokens placed on it to indicate the damage. a unit still inflicts its full strength in wounds to any unit that attacks it, even if previously wounded. trumping units the rock-paper-scissors relationship between artillery, infantry, and mounted units is shown on the cards by trump symbols. when a unit attacks or is attacked by a unit that it has pictured on its card as a trump symbol, it trumps that unit, dealing its damage before the other unit can do so. if this damage kills the trumped unit, the trumped unit deals no damage back. battle abilities tech cards with resource abilities used in battle are always used before or after attacking an enemy front, never during—even if the effects may last through an attack. aircraft units a player who learns the flight tech may produce aircraft units; they cannot trump or be trumped by any unit. 4. resolving the battle the battle is over after both players have played all of their battle forces. all wounds are removed from surviving units, then each player tallies up the strength of all of their surviving units, adding in the value of the combat bonus card, if they have it. the player with the highest total wins; ties go to the defender. the winner loses 1 army figure in the square for every 2 of their units that were killed in the battle. a player’s last army figure in the square can never be lost this way. the winner also receives a reward: the loser had 1 or more figures in the square: the loser’s figures in the square are all killed and removed from the board (although they may be built again later). the winner may then take their choice of one of the following from the loser: up to 3 points of trade from the loser’s trade dial. up to 3 culture tokens. any 1 resource token. (facedown hut and village tokens may be chosen, but the winner does not get to see what they are before choosing). the loser was defending one of their non-capital cities: the loser’s city is destroyed and its city marker is returned to its owner’s civilization sheet. any buildings in its outskirts are returned to the market, and any wonders or great people in its outskirts are removed from the game. the winner’s figures remain in the square where the city center was, and the winner then gets to do one of the following: learn one of the loser’s known techs that the winner does not know, without having to pay the trade cost. the winner must have a legal spot in their tech pyramid to do so. steal one of the loser’s culture event cards. the winner only gets to look at the card backs when choosing. steal up to any 2 resource tokens from the loser. facedown hut and village tokens may be chosen, but the winner does not get to see what they are before choosing. the loser was defending their capital city: the winner immediately wins the game with a military victory. aftermath any surviving units (whether owned by the winner or the loser) are returned to their owner’s standing forces. any killed units are placed faceup on the bottom of their respective unit decks.fame and fortune setup add the 4 new civilization sheets. add the 4 new tech cards to each player’s existing tech deck, and the metropolis markers to each player’s city markers. place the military reference cards with each player’s setup card. add the new home map tiles and shuffle the new neutral map tiles in with the other neutral map tiles. then add the hut and village markers to those from the core game. shuffle the new wonder and culture event cards into their respective decks. if playing with 5 players, use the setup diagram for 5 players in the expansion rulebook. build the wonder deck by shuffling the modern wonders and dealing 4 of them facedown into a deck. return the remaining modern wonders to the box unseen. repeat this process with the medieval wonders, dealing the 4 medieval wonders on top of the modern wonders. then repeat the process with the ancient wonders, dealing the 4 ancient wonders on top of the medieval wonders. once the wonder deck has been built, egypt, if playing, receives the top card, and then the top 4 cards are turned faceup and placed in the wonder market spaces. set up the great person deck and/or investments if playing with those expansions. a basic building is a building that is not upgraded. a player immune to anarchy never needs to change to the anarchy government. culture events cannot force the player to do so, and they may switch directly to a new government type, even if they did not learn that government on the previous turn. civilization bonuses for new civilizations arabia gains 1 of each type of resource token (1 incense, 1 iron, 1 silk, and 1 wheat); and arabia’s artillery military level marker starts the game at rank 2. greece begins the game governed by democracy instead of by despotism; and greece’s infantry military level marker starts the game at rank 2. india starts the game with a metropolis instead of a normal capital; this must occupy 2 of the 4 center squares on india’s home map tile and cannot be placed diagonally. spain takes the white spanish scout figure. when figures are placed on the map, spain places the white scout figure as well. as with russia, this increases the number of figures that spain can have on the map at the same time. however spain’s stacking limit still starts at 2, so spain may not place all 3 of its figures in the same square at the start of the game. america when playing with the great person deck, america draws a great person card at the start of the game. rules changes & clarifications adding wonders to the market board each time a wonder is purchased from the market, the next wonder in the deck is drawn and placed faceup in the market to replace it, along with its accompanying wonder marker. obsoleting wonders in the market when obsoleting a wonder using a tech card, you may choose a wonder still in the market to obsolete. the obsoleted wonder is discarded from the market along with its marker, and a new wonder is drawn from the deck to replace it.looting after battle adjust the looting system as follows: if the loser had 1 or more figures in the square: the winner gains 1 loot. if the loser was defending one of their non-capital cities: the winner gains 2 loot. if the loser was defending their capital city: the winner immediately wins the game with a military victory. the winner immediately spends the loot they received to purchase effects as follows. a winner receiving more than 1 loot may purchase as many effects as they can afford, and they may purchase the same effect multiple times. 1 loot effect • steal up to 3 points of trade from the loser’s trade dial. • steal up to 3 culture tokens from the loser. • steal any 1 resource token from the loser (facedown hut and village tokens may be chosen, but the winner does not get to see what they are before choosing). • force the loser to discard a coin token of the winner’s choice. this cannot affect investments. 2 loot effects • learn one of the loser’s known techs that the winner does not know, without having to pay the trade cost. the winner must have a legal spot in their tech pyramid to do so. • steal one of the loser’s culture event cards. the winner only gets to look at the card backs when choosing. • steal one of the loser’s coin tokens and place it on the winner’s civilization sheet. this cannot affect investments. expansion rules new hut and village effects friendly barbarian: immediately reveal and discard this marker, then either build 1 unlocked unit for free and add it to your standing forces, or build a figure for free and place it in the square where this marker was found (do not exceed stacking limit). friendly workers: reveal and discard this marker during city management to have one of your cities produce an extra 4 that turn. native art: immediately reveal and discard this marker, then gain either 3 or 6 culture tokens, as indicated on the marker. teacher: keep this marker. reveal and discard it during the start of turn phase to learn a level i tech for free. wealth: immediately reveal and discard this marker, then gain 1 coin token, placing it on your civilization sheet. disbanding figures, fortifying cities, and sending caravans armies and scouts may be voluntarily disbanded: first move the figure into the city center of one of your own cities. then remove it from the board. figures may still move through friendly city centers as long as they don’t end their movement there. fortifying a city if you disband an army, you may fortify the city the army figure was disbanded in. place a fortification/caravan marker on the city center, fortification side up. when you defend a fortified city, you receive a +2 combat bonus. if a fortified city successfully defends itself against an attacker in combat, the fortification marker is discarded. a city may only have 1 fortification marker on it at a time, and a fortified city cannot also have a caravan marker placed on it.caravans if you disband a scout, you may send a caravan to the city the scout figure was disbanded in. place a fortification/caravan marker on the city center, caravan side up. when you take a build action in a city with a caravan marker, you may discard the caravan marker to have the city produce 2 extra that turn. a city may only have 1 caravan marker on it at a time, and a city with a caravan cannot also have a fortification marker placed on it. relics when a map tile with a relic is discovered, place the matching relic marker on the appropriate square. while it remains in place, the square cannot be built in or altered by any culture event, tech, or other game effects, nor may any cities may be built adjacent to it, or any scout figures enter the square unless accompanied by 1 or more armies (not even if owned by a player whose civilization is governed by a republic). when 1 or more army figures end their movement on a relic square, their owner removes the relic marker from the board, gaining a special one-time ability. once the marker is removed, the relic square may be built over or altered as normal. atlantis (water square): learn a free tech of your choice at the start of the next turn. you must have a legal space in your tech pyramid to place the new tech. school of confucius (mountain square): immediately gain 1 great person. a greek player removing this relic marker draws 2 great people and chooses 1 to keep. seven cities of gold (forest square): invest 2 coins for free at the start of the next turn (ie, you gain 2 investment markers, but do not lose 2 coin tokens to pay for them). metropolises the agriculture tech allows you to grow your capital into a metropolis. when devoted to the arts, a metropolis produces a base of 2 culture instead of 1. a metropolis receives an extra +2 combat bonus when you are defending it. both squares containing a metropolis marker are that city’s center, while the 10 squares surrounding the metropolis marker are the city’s outskirts. it may extend partially into water and doesn’t count as water for movement, so its owner can use it as a makeshift bridge. growing a capital into a metropolis when you learn the agriculture tech, your capital immediately grows into a metropolis, if possible. remove your capital marker and place your metropolis marker on the map, as follows: the metropolis must occupy the square the capital marker occupied plus one of its 4 non-diagonally adjacent squares (its expansion square). the expansion square must not contain any enemy figures. if the expansion square contains any friendly figures, immediately move them to an adjacent square they can legally end their movement in. if the expansion square contains a wonder, great person, or building, then the square’s previous contents are overbuilt, as described in the core rules. an expansion square may be a water square (the square is no longer considered to be water for purposes of movement). the metropolis’s new outskirts cannot overlap another city’s outskirts, or extend off the map or into unexplored territory. if a capital can be grown into a metropolis when agriculture is learned, then it must be. if it cannot be grown into a metropolis that turn, you must do so during the start of turn phase on any subsequent turn in which it becomes possible.optional additions all players must agree at the start of the game whether or not to use these game additions. 1. great person deck setup during setup, instead of shuffling the great person markers; turn them faceup and sort them by type (artist, builder, general, humanitarian, industrialist, and scientist). then shuffle the great person deck and place it on the table facedown. gaining great people when you gain a great person, draw a card from the deck and keep it facedown and secret from the other players until used. take the type of great person marker that matches the picture shown on the card. this marker may be placed on the board or held in reserve as normal. if no markers of the type shown on the card are available, discard the card faceup to the bottom of the deck and draw again until you draw an available one. if there are none available at all, you don’t receive a great person. if the players go through the entire great person deck and a faceup card is revealed on top of the deck, turn the deck over and shuffle it to create a new deck. great person abilities each ability on a great person card indicates when it can be used. to use an ability, turn the card faceup and keep it in front of you (if the card must be discarded for the ability to be used, discard it faceup to the bottom of the great person deck). you cannot use a great person’s ability unless you have at least 1 great person marker of that person’s type on the map. killing great people you may only have 1 great person card (faceup or facedown) for each great person marker of that type you possess (including markers on the map and those in reserve). if you have too many of the same type of great person card, randomly discard cards of that type one at a time until you no longer have too many. 2. investment deck when playing with the arabs, the investment deck must be used. setup during setup, each player takes their deck of 4 investment cards. investing coins each player may invest 1 coin token (not coins printed on the map, tech cards, or buildings) at the start of the each turn by discarding a coin token to gain 1 investment marker. then choose 1 of your investment cards and place the marker on top of it, keeping the card faceup. each time you invest, you may place the new investment marker on a different one of your investment cards, or you may pile several investment markers on top of the same card. investments do not count towards the 15 coins needed for an economic victory, but neither can investments be discarded from play by other players. investment effects when adding an investment marker to an investment card, you look to see if an ability becomes active. an investment ability becomes active when the total number of investment markers on the card is equal to or higher than the number shown to the left of the investment ability. only the most expensive active ability on an investment card has an effect. once a more expensive ability on an investment card becomes active, less expensive abilities on that card cease to function.wisdom and w arf are setup add the 6 new civilization sheets. add the 6 new tech cards to each player’s existing tech deck, and remove the old metal casting and railroad techs. if you are not using the fame and fortune expansion, ignore the purple tech cards. shuffle the new wonder and culture

core game, along with the new relic markers. add the shipyard buildings to the buildings, and cover the harbor area of the market board with the new market overlay. separate the 5 city-state markers from the rest of the markers and shuffle them in a facedown pile near the market board. replace the unit and government cards from the core game with the new unit and government cards. the new units are still separated by type, and are not compatible with the original units. if using the fame and fortune expansion, remove the old leonidas card from the great person deck and remove the endowment for the arts card from each investment deck. replace them with the new cards included with this expansion. otherwise, ignore these replacement cards. each player receives 1 deck of social policy cards. build the wonder deck by shuffling the modern wonders and dealing 4 of them facedown into a deck. return the remaining modern wonders to the box unseen. repeat this process with the medieval wonders, dealing the 4 medieval wonders on top of the modern wonders. then repeat the process with the ancient wonders, dealing the 4 ancient wonders on top of the medieval wonders. once the wonder deck has been built, egypt, if playing, receives the top card, and then the top 4 cards are turned faceup and placed in the wonder market spaces. civilization bonuses for new civilizations the aztecs have no special setup bonuses other than their starting tech. their home tile has only 3 starting options for their capital city because one of the 4 central squares on their home map tile is a water square. the english have no special setup bonuses other than their starting tech. the french start with a social policy maximum of 2, and their social policy maximum is increased by 1. the japanese start governed by feudalism instead of despotism. in addition, due to chivalry, japan’s mounted military marker starts the game at rank 2. the mongols start with 2 extra mounted units from the market board, adding the units to their standing forces. in addition, due to horseback riding, their travel speed starts at 3. the zulu start with 2 extra artillery units from the market board, adding the units to their standing forces.rules changes & clarifications adding wonders to the market board each time a wonder is purchased from the market, the next wonder in the deck is drawn and placed faceup in the market to replace it, along with its accompanying wonder marker. obsoleting wonders in the market when obsoleting a wonder using a tech card, you may choose a wonder still in the market to obsolete. the obsoleted wonder is discarded from the market along with its marker, and a new wonder is drawn from the deck to replace it. looting after battle adjust the looting system as follows: if the loser had 1 or more figures in the square: the winner gains 1 loot. if the loser was defending one of their non-capital cities: the winner gains 2 loot. if the loser was defending their capital city: the winner immediately wins the game with a military victory. the winner immediately spends the loot they received to purchase effects as follows. a winner receiving more than 1 loot may purchase as many effects as they can afford, and they may purchase the same effect multiple times. 1 loot effect • steal up to 3 points of trade from the loser’s trade dial. • steal up to 3 culture tokens from the loser. • steal any 1 resource token from the loser (facedown hut and village tokens may be chosen, but the winner does not get to see what they are before choosing). • force the loser to discard a coin token of the winner’s choice. this cannot affect investments. 2 loot effects • learn one of the loser’s known techs that the winner does not know, without having to pay the trade cost. the winner must have a legal spot in their tech pyramid to do so. • steal one of the loser’s culture event cards. the winner only gets to look at the card backs when choosing. • steal one of the loser’s coin tokens and place it on the winner’s civilization sheet. this cannot affect investments. expansion rules new city action: start a building program there is a fourth city action available to all players: start a building program. when a city starts a building program, place a building program marker on it. a city cannot have more than 1 such marker on it at a time. the marker stays until the city is destroyed or the city is used to produce a figure, unit, building, or wonder. the next time that city is used to produce a figure, unit, building, or wonder, discard its building program marker and double the amount of the city has in its outskirts for the duration of the action. a city must use a building program marker when it produces. the city does not double any gained from other sources, and any excess after the produce action is complete is wasted. combat each unit now has strength (how many wounds the unit deals when it attacks) and health (how many wounds the unit can sustain before it is killed) values. any unit that suffers wounds equal to its health value is immediately killed. return killed units faceup to the bottom of the unit deck they were originally acquired from. engaged units units cannot attack an existing front that has 2 units already engaged on it. if all fronts are currently engaged from both sides, you must start a new front. resolving a battle after both players have played all of their battle forces, the battle is over. before wound tokens are removed from surviving units in the battle, each player adds together the health values of all their surviving units. then each player subtracts the total number of wounds on their surviving units, and adds the value of the combat bonus card (if they have it) to determine their final combat value. the player with the highest total wins the battle, with ties going to the defender. new culture event cards the new culture event card roaming horde gives a player the ability to cause barbarians to attack another player’s army figure or city. a player who plays one of these cards becomes the barbarian player and controls the barbarian units. barbarian units are stronger than normal, and use rank ii units instead of rank i. if the player who was attacked by barbarians wins the battle, they do not receive any rewards. several other new culture cards have 2 effects, with each effect tied to a different phase. you must choose in which phase you are playing the card, and cannot resolve both effects. wealth hut and village effect wealth: immediately reveal

square the hut or village was on. effects of a city-state you control a city-state if you have a figure on the square it occupies. a controlled city-state is considered in the outskirts of the controlling player’s capital. it can generate production, trade, culture, and other bonuses for the controlling player. you can also place figures you build with your capital in the squares of city- states you control, following normal stacking limits. armies garrisoned in a city-state can be attacked by other players. city-states provide a small defensive bonus (+4) if its garrison is attacked. if a scout on a city-state is attacked, it is removed from the board without a battle, as normal. you may build cities in the same square as a city-state. when a city is built on top of a city-state, the city-state is destroyed and you receive 3 . you cannot build cities adjacent to city-states. if the zulu explore a city-state by building a city, the city-state is immediately destroyed and the zulu receive 3 .abandoning a city-state you can move your figures away from a city-state per normal movement rules. if you leave a city-state, you no longer gain any of the bonuses for controlling it. city-states exist even if no player controls them. social policies social policies are represented by a set of 4 double-sided cards, and every civilization begins the game with 1 set. they are always unlocked at the start of a game, but a civilization cannot benefit from a social policy until it adopts it. each social policy card has a title and one or more abilities. each start of turn ability can only be used once per turn. if a card has 2 abilities, both can be used once. adopting social policies a civilization’s social policy maximum is equal to the number of its built cities. each time a civilization’s social policy maximum increases, it must immediately adopt a new social policy. each civilization begins the game with a social policy maximum of 1, and should adopt a social policy during setup (note the french start with an additional policy). when your civilization adopts a new social policy, choose a social policy card you do not currently have and flip it to its desired side. after you have adopted a social policy, you cannot adopt another from that same card; to use the reverse side of the card, the social policy must be switched. losing social policies each time your civilization’s social policy maximum decreases, choose a social policy card you currently have and return it to your pile of unused social policies (any policy on the card can be re-adopted later). switching social policies after a social policy is adopted it cannot normally be changed. if an effect allows you to switch a currently adopted social policy, you may either flip a currently adopted policy to its reverse side, or switch out a currently adopted policy card for a different card you are not currently using. relics when a map tile with a relic is discovered, place the matching relic marker on the appropriate square. while the marker remains in place, the square cannot be built in or altered by any culture event, tech, or other game effects. while the marker remains in place, no cities may be built adjacent to it, nor may any scout figures enter the square unless accompanied by 1 or more armies (not even if their owner’s civilization has adopted the pacifism social policy). when 1 or more army figures end their movement on a relic square, their owner removes the relic marker from the board, gaining a special one-time ability. once the marker is removed, the relic square may be built over or altered as normal. armies may move through a relic square without ending their movement. ark of the covenant if you remove the ark of the covenant relic from the board, receive 2 free advances on the culture track. the ark of the covenant is a desert square. attila’s village if you remove the attila’s village relic from the board, immediately build 2 unlocked

remove the attila’s village relic from the board, immediately build 2 unlocked units of your choice for free. attila’s village is a grassland square. school of confucius (mountain square): immediately gain 1 great person. a greek player removing this relic marker draws 2 great people and chooses 1 to keep. seven cities of gold (forest square): invest 2 coins for free at the start of the next turn (ie, you gain 2 investment markers, but do not lose 2 coin tokens to pay for them). metropolises the agriculture tech allows you to grow your capital into a metropolis. when devoted to the arts, a metropolis produces a base of 2 culture instead of 1. a metropolis receives an extra +2 combat bonus when you are defending it. both squares containing a metropolis marker are that city’s center, while the 10 squares surrounding the metropolis marker are the city’s outskirts. it may extend partially into water and doesn’t count as water for movement, so its owner can use it as a makeshift bridge. when you learn the agriculture tech, your capital immediately grows into a metropolis, if possible. remove your capital marker and place your metropolis marker on the map, as follows: the metropolis must occupy the square the capital marker occupied plus one of its 4 non-diagonally adjacent squares (its expansion square). the expansion square must not contain any enemy figures. if the expansion square contains any friendly figures, immediately move them to an adjacent square they can legally end their movement in. if the expansion square contains a wonder, great person, or building, then the square’s previous contents are overbuilt, as described in the core rules. an expansion square may be a water square (the square is no longer considered to be water for purposes of movement). the metropolis’s new outskirts cannot overlap another city’s outskirts, or extend off the map or into unexplored territory. if a capital can be grown into a metropolis when agriculture is learned, then it must be. if it cannot be grown into a metropolis that turn, you must do so during the start of turn phase on any subsequent turn in which it becomes possible. combat each unit now has strength (how many wounds the unit deals when it attacks) and health (how many wounds the unit can sustain before it is killed) values. any unit that suffers wounds equal to its health value is immediately killed. return killed units faceup to the bottom of the unit deck they were originally acquired from. engaged units units cannot attack an existing front that has 2 units already engaged on it. if all fronts are currently engaged from both sides, you must start a new front. resolving a battle after both players have played all of their battle forces, the battle is over. before wound tokens are removed from surviving units in the battle, each player adds together the health values of all their surviving units. then each player subtracts the total number of wounds on their surviving units, and adds the value of the combat bonus card (if they have it) to determine their final combat value. the player with the highest total wins the battle, with ties going to the defender.all players must agree at the start of the game whether or not to use the following game additions: option 1: great person deck setup during setup, instead of shuffling the great person markers; turn them faceup and sort them by type (artist, builder, general, humanitarian, industrialist, and scientist). then shuffle the great person deck and place it on the table facedown. gaining great people when you gain a great person, draw a card from the deck and keep it facedown and secret from the other players until used. take the type of great person marker that matches the picture shown on the card. this marker may be placed on the board or held in reserve as normal. if no markers of the type shown on the card are available, discard the card faceup to the bottom of the deck and draw again until you draw an available one. if there are none available at all, you don’t receive a great person. if the players go through the entire great person deck and a faceup card is revealed on top of the deck, turn the deck over and shuffle it to create a new deck. great person abilities each ability on a great person card indicates when it can be used. to use an ability, turn the card faceup and keep it in front of you (if the card must be discarded for the ability to be used, discard it faceup to the bottom of the great person deck). you cannot use a great person’s ability unless you have at least 1 great person marker of that person’s type on the map. killing great people you may only have 1 great person card (faceup or facedown) for each great person marker of that type you possess (including markers on the map and those in reserve). if you have too many of the same type of great person card, randomly discard cards of that type one at a time until you no longer have too many. option 2: investment deck when playing with the arabs, the investment deck must be used. setup during setup, each player takes their deck of 4 investment cards. investing coins each player may invest 1 coin token (not coins printed on the map, tech cards, or buildings) at the start of the each turn by discarding a coin token to gain 1 investment marker. then choose one of your investment cards and place the marker on top of it, keeping the card faceup. each time you invest, you may place the new investment marker on a different one of your investment cards, or you may pile several investment markers on top of the same card. investments do not count towards the 15 coins needed for an economic victory, but neither can investments be discarded from play by other players. investment effects when adding an investment marker to an investment card, you look to see if an ability becomes active. an investment ability becomes active when the total number of investment markers on the card is equal to or higher than the number shown to the left of the investment ability. only the most expensive active ability on an investment card has an effect. once a more expensive ability on an investment card becomes active, less expensive abilities on it cease to function."

number 2 location. place the ship board near the atlas with the side faceup that corresponds to the number of players. place the ship action token nearby. place 3 coins and 1 grain on the ship board. place the captain sofi odessa crew board near the ship board. distribute the remaining crew boards among the players as evenly as possible. each player places their board(s) in front of them. shuffle the ability deck and place it near the atlas. decide on a first player and give them the captain token. shuffle the market deck and place it near the atlas. separate the event cards by type (mild, perilous, and deadly) and shuffle each pile separately. draw 6 of each of the deadly, perilous, and mild cards. place the deadly cards facedown, then stack the facedown perilous cards on top, followed by the facedown mild cards. place this final deck of 18 event cards on the space on the ship board and return the unused cards to the box. place the starting adventure cards (gloria, soup, gear, and flapjacks) near the ship board. place the magnetic card box that contains adventure and quest cards nearby (do not look at them or change their order). place the deck of enemy cards near the board, facedown (do not look at them or change their order). place the synergy tokens nearby. shuffle the search tokens and place them in a facedown stack. place the remaining tokens and the storybook near the board, and the level cards near the ship board. each crew member has specific level cards and you can look through yours at any time. give each player 1 command token and 1 ability card. take a new journey log sheet for your campaign. choose to play normal or brutal mode and check the appropriate box. write the date at the top of the sheet and all player names at the bottom. playing the game during the game, if you must draw fate, draw a card from the ability card deck, check the number in the top left, then immediately discard the card. starting with the first player, players take turns in clockwise order. follow these steps on your turn: 1. ship action choose a ship action. move the ship action figure to 1 of the 5 ship rooms and apply its effect. you must move the ship action figure to a new room each turn. you may never give command tokens or ability cards to other players. if the command tokens run out, you cannot gain any until some are returned to the supply. if the ability deck or search tokens run out, shuffle the discards to make a new deck or draw pile. a room cannot be used if it has 2 damage. if you cannot use any room, move the ship action figure to one of them, but take no action. bridge: draw 1 ability card and gain the specified command. also return any command tokens from all crew members and adventure cards to the supply. galley: draw 1/2 ability cards (depending on the number of players) and gain the specified command. you may discard 1 ability card from your hand to remove 1 fatigue from any crew member.deck: gain the specified command.

choice, or have you complete a challenge. 3. two actions on your turn you are the active player: perform 2 actions (you may perform an action twice in a turn). at the end of your turn, pass the captain token to the player on your left, who then starts their turn. action: travel you may move the ship to a new region. regions are separated by dotted lines, land, and the edge of the page. the ship cannot move through land. if you want a crew member to participate (this is optional) they gain 1 fatigue after you move the ship. then draw fate. add the crew member’s craft skill to the fate draw. check the result on the table on the ship board for the distance you may travel; each distance allows you to move to an adjacent region. if you move into a region with a hazard, its effects are activated. the challenge type and difficulty are on the left side of the icon, and the consequence for failure is on the right. a damage icon indicates ship damage. if you reach the edge of the map and want to keep going in the same direction, you may as long as there is an icon indicating which page to turn to. remove the ship token from the map, then turn to the specified page in the atlas and place your ship token on that page. you always enter the map on the opposite side of where you left; if there are multiple regions on the new edge, choose which to start on. action: explore explore a location with a red circle outline in the same region as the ship. open the storybook to the paragraph number on the location. read the first text box in the story (aloud, unless you are playing solo). after each text box, one of the following occurs: • make a choice, and possibly overcome a challenge or combat. after completing this, turn to the listed story number. • you gain rewards or suffer negative effects (listed in italics). • the phrase return to the ship means the story ends; close the storybook and return all explore tokens to the supply. continue your turn as normal (or end it, if you have taken 2 actions). if a story starts with a town or city name, the story structure often allows you to select all of the various choices in the same visit, one by one. you may not, however, select the same choice more than once during each explore action at the town/city. action: visit a market location the ship must be in the same region as a market location. draw 7 cards from the market deck. you may purchase any of them at the cost listed near the name. place purchased cards faceup near the ship board, next to your other adventure cards. place any cards you do not purchase at the bottom of the market deck.action: visit a port the ship must be in the same region as a port. you may then perform any or all of the following: inn: pay 4 coins to the supply. restore 1 health and remove 1 fatigue from each crew member. shipyard: pay any number of materials resource tokens and/ or coins to the supply to repair 1 ship damage per spent materials token/coin. healer: pay 1 coin to the supply to fully restore the health of 1 crew member. you may do this for any number of crew members. spend xp: you may spend xp to purchase level cards for any crew members. keep track of xp on the journey log sheet, and cross off or mark when you spend them to buy level cards (the cost is on the scroll in the top right). when you buy a level card, immediately equip it to the associated crew member, where it remains for the rest of the campaign. level cards do not count towards a crew member’s limit of 2 equipped ability cards. spending command you may spend command to do the following at any time, even on other players’ turns (with some exceptions): train (equip an ability card) each player has a hand limit of 3 ability cards. after drawing new ability cards, if you have more than 3 in hand, you must immediately discard cards of your choice until you have 3 in hand. ability cards are kept secret until they are used. equip an ability by assigning an ability card from your hand to any crew member (even those controlled by other players), tucking the card beneath the bottom edge of the crew board so the skill icon and the ability is showing. then, pay the listed command cost on the card to the supply. each tucked card increases the crew member’s skill in the type on the card by 1. each crew member can have up to 2 tucked ability cards at once (not including level cards or weapons). at any time, you can discard equipped ability cards from a crew member you control. some tucked cards also give the crew member an ability. activate crew ability you may activate a crew ability on one of the crew members you control by placing the specified amount of command on the crew board. if there are already command tokens on a crew board, you cannot activate any of the listed crew abilities on it until the tokens have been removed. activate adventure cards any player may activate any adventure cards the players collectively own by placing the specified amount of command on the card. if there are already command tokens on the card, it cannot be activated until the tokens have been removed. activate ability card abilities some ability cards require you to spend command to activate their ability. in this case, return the command to the supply. challenges each challenge is associated with one of the 5 crew skills: strength cunning savvy perception craft a basic challenge specifies the skill to use and the required number, followed by a list of consequences if you fail to obtain the required number. to overcome a challenge: 1. decide which (if any) of your crew members participate (from among those you control and captain sofi odessa). crew members with 2 fatigue cannot participate. you cannot use a crew member more than once per challenge. give each crew member that participates 1 fatigue. if another player wants to use the crew members they control to participate in the challenge, they must pay 1 command. this cost is the same no matter how many crew members they use. determine the sum of the appropriate skills on participating crew members. 2. draw fate: draw a card from the ability deck and check the fate number in the top left corner of the card. add the participating crew skill to this number. 3. you may now use crew abilities, adventure cards, and equipped ability cards to alter the fate draw outcomes by spending command to activate their abilities. any player may also discard ability cards from their hand to give +1 skill to any of your crew members in the type specified on the card. 4. if the final skill number is equal to or greater than the required challenge number, you succeed. otherwise, you fail and must take the consequences. 5. discard the ability card used for the fate draw. success: if you gain a high enough skill number, ignore any failure consequences. read the next line and follow the instructions. failure: if you fail, apply the consequences and read the failure description, if any. damage (- health): take the specified crew damage. it must be applied to any crew members that participated first. the active player decides where to place damage. ship damage: take the listed ship damage. for each damage, draw fate and place the damage cube on that numbered room. if the room has full damage, you may choose where to place it. turn to x: turn to the specified story number, instead of the number listed on the next line (if any). gain venom / weakened / frightened / madness / low morale: place the appropriate token on one of your crew members. after applying consequences, if you were not instructed to turn to a different story number, apply any effects on the next line and continue reading as if you had succeeded. combat when a story section ends with the word combat followed by a list of numbers, you must defeat the enemies in combat: take the listed enemy cards from the enemy deck without looking at the front of any cards. shuffle them, then place them faceup in a row, without any space between the cards. distribute the 4 combat action tokens. 4 players: each player gets 1 token. 3 players: active player gets 2 tokens, each other player gets 1 token. 2 players: each player gets 2 tokens. 1 player: gets all 4 tokens. place the synergy tokens on their matching crew boards. combat rounds start the first combat round and continue with combat rounds until all enemy cards are defeated or all crew members have 0 health. complete a combat round as follows: attack and counterattack first, players use their combat action tokens in any order. place a token on one of your crew members and perform an attack with one of their weapons. each attack is immediately followed by an enemy counterattack (unless the targeted enemy is defeated). a crew member that already has 2 combat action tokens cannot attack again until the next combat round. each crew member has a basic starting weapon and can also equip any number of weapon cards. end of round after all players have used their tokens, any remaining enemies attack the crew and activate their end of round abilities. the active player decides which crew are attacked by each enemy card. damage from 1 enemy card must all go to 1 crew member. if a crew member runs out of health, any remaining damage must be dealt to another crew member, and so on. do not apply weapon defense at this point, only defense that applies during ‘the end of round enemy attack’. if any enemies remain, players reclaim their combat action tokens and start a new round of combat. when all enemies are defeated, you win the combat. return the enemy cards to the stack of facedown enemy cards (in the correct order) and continue reading in the storybook. players can give each other unused combat action tokens, but each time a combat action token is given, one of the players must pay 1 command. attacking choose an enemy card to be the target of the attack. draw fate and add that number to the weapon’s accuracy . compare the total to the enemy’s defense number. if equal to or greater than the defense, the attack hits. otherwise, it misses. if you hit, place damage tokens on the enemy card equal to the weapon’s damage. you must place all damage from the same attack adjacently (not diagonally), and each square can only hold 1 token. you cannot place damage on or skip a square that already has a damage token. the damage does not need to be placed in a straight line. if all squares containing a heart symbol are covered, the enemy is defeated. return the defeated card to the enemy deck and slide any remaining enemy cards together so that they are adjacent. when you place a damage token on a square, all abilities in the square are disabled. if the enemy card you attacked was not defeated, it counterattacks immediately, dealing its damage to the crew member who attacked it. enemies deal damage equal to their basic damage plus any bonus damage on their squares (if a square with enemy damage is covered by a damage token, that damage is disabled). apply any block from the weapon you used. if the crew member runs out of health, choose another crew member to take any remaining damage, and so on. if you missed, you still get to deal 1 damage, after the enemy counterattacks (even if you were reduced to 0 health). apply weapon block as normal to this counterattack. splash damage: when placing damage on an enemy card, you may place some of it on adjacent enemy cards as long as it follows the damage adjacency rule and at least half of the damage (rounded up) is dealt to the enemy card that you originally targeted. double or triple hearts: some enemy hearts have a 2 or 3 on them. these hearts require 2 or 3 damage to cover (you still only place 1 damage token on the square). flying: enemies with a wing symbol have the flying ability. this means that they have +1 defense against any weapons that do not have the ranged attribute. synergy tokens if a crew member ever places damage on a square with a synergy point (the red diamond), they place their synergy tokens on a different crew board. if a crew member has a synergy token from a different crew member on their board, they may return it to the matching board in order to use the ability on the synergy token. captain odessa: the crew member may place damage diagonally.gregory: when the crew member reaches 0 health, restore 2. kannan: the crew member may redraw fate during an attack. audrie, kasumi, and laurent: the crew member deals +1 damage during their attack. mac: the crew member gains +2 accuracy during their attack. marco: the crew member can deal an extra 2 damage during an attack. this damage may not be placed on enemy heart symbols. rafael: the crew member gains 2 block. damage & health this symbol shows the amount of damage dealt by a crew member or enemy card in an attack. a crew member cannot hold more damage than their health. when you are instructed to restore health to a crew member, remove the specified number of damage tokens. if a crew member has damage equal to their health, they can no longer participate in combat or challenges or activate any of their abilities until they regain at least 1 health. fatigue when crew members participate in challenges, they gain fatigue. a second fatigue token means the crew member deals -1 damage when attacking. if a crew member has only 1 token, place the blank side faceup. a second fatigue token should have the -1 damage side faceup. each crew member can hold up to 2 fatigue tokens. a crew member with 2 fatigue tokens cannot participate in challenges, but can participate in combat. you remove fatigue mainly by cooking recipes or a port action. status when a crew member gains a status, place the appropriate token on the crew board. the crew member must apply the effect. venom: take 1 damage at the start of each player’s turn. frightened: cannot be used for attack actions. weakened: skills are at -2. madness: take 1 damage when participating in challenges. low morale: pay 1 extra command when participating in challenges. quest cards when the storybook says gain quest x, retrieve the quest card from the quest deck and place it faceup near the atlas. when the storybook says lose quest x or complete quest x, place the specified card in the used quest box. once there it cannot be retrieved (unless you are starting a new campaign). this symbol means that this quest is an active quest: you can travel somewhere to complete it. cards without this symbol generally only need to be referenced when you check for a specific keyword. event decks each campaign, you go through the event deck 3 times. each time you reach the end of the deck, follow these instructions: first time: after you have drawn all cards from the event deck, finish the current player’s turn. on the next turn, read paragraph 1 instead of drawing an event card. second time: after you have drawn all cards from the event deck, finish the current player’s turn. on the next turn, read paragraph 1.2 instead of drawing an event card.third time: after you have drawn all cards from the event deck, finish the current player’s turn. on the next turn, read paragraph f1 instead of drawing an event card. ongoing: if you draw an event card with this attribute, place it faceup near the ship board. apply the effects until you’re able to discard the card, as described on each card. keywords a story may require you to have a keyword to read it, or have a specific keyword to make a choice. keywords are located on quest cards: if you own the card, you have the keyword. if a story says, if keyword x, turn to x, then you must follow these instructions if you have the listed keyword. if a choice says requires keyword x, then you cannot choose it unless you have the keyword (although you are not forced to choose it if you do). totems you must find as many totems as possible. the number of totems you find determines the story finale at the end of the campaign. all totems are adventure cards. whenever you find a totem, mark the appropriate box on the achievement sheet. when you complete alternate endings, you also mark certain boxes on the achievement sheet. as you complete certain achievements, you gain unlocked cards, which can be used in future campaigns. defeat there are 2 ways you can be defeated and lose the game: all crew member health is reduced to 0, or the ship has 11 damage. if playing normal mode, after checking a defeat box on your journey log, follow these instructions: all crew reduced to 0 health: move to the nearest port and remove all crew damage and fatigue. discard 6 event cards from the top of the event deck. start a new turn. ship has 11 damage: move to the nearest port and remove all ship damage. discard 6 event cards from the top of the event deck and start a new turn. if the event deck runs out, count the remaining cards you need to discard and place that number of damage on the event deck slot, to remind you how many cards you must discard the next time the storybook instructs you to make a new event deck. (if this is your third time through the deck, you don’t need to keep track.) campaign the game only supports 1 campaign at a time. use your journey log sheet to write down when you gain experience points (xp), feared/revered points, and when you need to save the game. you can write notes on the map on the back of the sheet. if you know that a location requires a keyword, write this down so you know where to return when you gain the keyword later. saving the game at the start of any player’s turn, you can decide to stop playing and save your game. on the next available line on your journey sheet, write down your ship’s location, its current damage, the last ship action that was used, which ability cards each player has in their hand, and how many unspent command tokens they have. place each crew board and all associated damage, status tokens, ability cards, level cards, and equipped weapons in a separate crew plastic bag. place all of your resources, coins, adventure cards, ability cards in hand, unused command tokens, quest cards, and the current event deck in the campaign box. adventure cards should be in their own bag, and put any that have command tokens on them facedown in the pile in the bag. place the ability card draw deck in a plastic bag with the ability card discard pile faceup and the draw deck facedown. indicate the bottom of the pile by placing a synergy token at the bottom. clean up the rest of the game components. setting up a saved game place the atlas in the center of the table and turn to the page of the location indicated on the most recent save line on the journey log sheet. place the ship token in the region. place the ship board near the atlas. place the ship damage markers as indicated on the most recent save line of the journey log. place any resources and coins from the campaign box on the ship board. one by one, remove the crew members and all associated tokens and cards from the crew bags. keep all associated tokens and cards with each respective crew member. place the captain sofi odessa crew board near the ship board, in the center of the table. distribute the remaining crew boards among the players as evenly as possible. each player places their crew boards in front of them. place the ability card draw and discard piles near the ship board. shuffle the market deck and place it nearby. place the event deck from the campaign box on the ship board. place your adventure cards near the ship board, faceup. place a command token from the supply on all adventure cards in the campaign box that were facedown in the deck. place the deck of enemy cards near the board, facedown. place all of your current quest cards near the ship board. place the magnetic card box nearby. place all remaining tokens near the board. place the storybook near the board. decide who will be first player and give them the captain token. give each player their hand of ability cards and command tokens according to the most recent save line on the journey log (player 1, player 2, etc). adding/removing players you can add or remove players at the end of any turn. to add a player, after the current turn ends, split up crew boards and assign them to each player as evenly as possible (except captain odessa, who is always controlled by the active player). to remove a player, after the current turn ends, reassign crew members to players as evenly as possible (except captain odessa, who is always controlled by the active player). the player that is leaving must discard 1 ability card and all but 1 of their command. the active player decides how to distribute the remaining cards and command token to the other players. turn the ship board to the correct side according to the number of players in the game. resetting the game for a new campaign return all adventure and quest cards to their respective deck in numerical order. return all level cards and tokens to the supply. final score at the end of the campaign, write down your final score on your journey log sheet. • 2 points per adventure card (+2 points if the card is a totem). • 1 point per quest card (include cards in the used quest box). • 2 points per level card. • 1 point per feared point or revered point. if your combined total of feared/ revered points is above 10, gain +10 points. • 1 point per 2 remaining coins. • 1 point per remaining artifact. • +10 points if you reached a campaign ending. • -10 points per defeat if playing normal mode. • +25 extra points if playing brutal mode."
171,40692,SMALL WORLD,2009,DAYS OF WONDER,2.3505,3389,"setup pick the map that matches the number of players and place the turn marker on the first space of the track. shuffle the race banners, draw 5 and lay them faceup in a single column. place the remaining banners in a faceup stack at the bottom of the column. repeat with the special power badges, fitting them next to the banners. place a lost tribe token on each region of the map with a lost tribe symbol, and a mountain token on each mountain region (they are immovable). a region is non-empty if it contains at least 1 lost tribe or race token (active or in decline). a region containing a mountain marker but no lost tribe or enemy race token is considered empty. each player takes 5 value ‘1’ victory coins. choose a player to take the first turn; play then proceeds clockwise. once all players have had a turn the first player moves the turn marker one space along the track before his next turn. when it reaches the last space, a final turn is played by all and the game ends. the player with the most victory coins is the winner. in the case of a tie, the player with the most race tokens (active + in decline) still on the board wins. the first turn during the first turn of the game, each player will: 1. pick a race and special power combo select 1 race and special power combo from among the 6 visible. the first combo at the top of the column is free. each of the others, as you move down the column, costs 1 additional victory coin. pay the cost by putting 1 of your coins on each of the combos situated above the combo you wish to pick. if the combo you select contains some coins, take them. place your combo face up in front of you, and pick a number of matching race tokens equal to the sum of the values on the race banner and its special power. unless stated otherwise, these tokens are the only ones you will be able to deploy for this race during the game. if a special power (or race power) lets you take additional race tokens during the course of the game, you are still limited by the total number available. then slide existing combos (and any coins on them) up 1 position in the column, and reveal a new combo from the top of the stack, if appropriate. 2. conquer regions first conquest a race deploying on the map for the first time must enter by conquering a border region (adjacent to the board edge, or whose shore is on a sea adjacent to the board edge). conquering a region to conquer a region, you must have 2 race tokens available to deploy; +1 per additional race token for each encampment, fortress, mountain, or troll’s lair; + 1 per additional race token for each lost tribe or other player’s race token already present in the region. regardless of a race and/or special power benefit, a player must always have at least 1 race token available to initiate a new conquest. seas and lakes cannot usually be conquered. deploy the race tokens used to conquer a region inside its borders. the tokens must remain in this region until you reorganize your troops at the end of this turn. enemy losses and withdrawals if another player’s race tokens occupied the region prior to its conquest, that player must immediately take all of them back in hand and: permanently discard 1 race token back into the tray; keep the other tokens in hand, and redeploy them in any other region(s) still occupied by his race (if any) as the final action of the current player’s turn. if all of a player’s regions were attacked this turn, leaving him with some race tokens in hand but none on the board, he may redeploy these as if he was doing a first conquest, on his next turn. when a region defended by a single token is captured, the defending token is discarded. following conquests you may repeat this process to conquer as many new regions as you wish during your turn, provided you have enough race tokens left. each of the newly conquered regions must be sharing a border with a region already occupied by your active race tokens, unless permitted otherwise by your combo. final conquest attempt / reinforcement die roll during the final conquest attempt of your turn, if you still have at least 1 unused race token, you may attempt 1 final conquest by selecting a region that you would normally be 3 or less race tokens short to conquer. once the region is selected, roll the reinforcement die once. if the sum of the die rolled and the number of race token(s) you have left is high enough to conquer the region, deploy your remaining race token(s) there. otherwise, deploy your remaining token(s) in one of the regions you have already occupied. your conquests for the turn then immediately end. troop redeployment you may now freely redeploy the race tokens you have on the board, moving them from one region to any other region occupied by your race, provided that at least one race token remains in each region you control. 3. score victory coins take 1 coin from the coin pool for each region your race tokens occupy. you may also collect additional coins as a result of your race and/or special power benefit. regions that your in decline tokens occupy also each contribute 1 coin; though the race and special power benefits no longer contribute coins, unless noted.players keep their coins in a stack with their values hidden from other players. final scores are not revealed until the end of the game. a player may request change from the coin pool at any time. following turns in following turns, each player must either: a. expand through new conquests ready your troops leaving in place 1 race token in each region they occupy, you may take all your other active race tokens from the map back in hand and use them to conquer new regions. conquer all rules relative to the conquest of a new region must be respected, except the first conquest rule. abandoning a region only those race tokens taken back in hand may be used to conquer new regions. if you wish to free up more race tokens, you may opt to entirely empty some, or all, regions, leaving no tokens there. these now abandoned regions will no longer be considered yours, nor bring you any coins. if you choose to abandon all your occupied regions, your next conquest must follow the first conquest rule. b. put a race in decline you may choose to put your race in decline by selecting a new race and special power combo from those available on the table at the start of your next turn. flip your race banner to the in decline side and discard the special power associated with it (it is no longer in effect, unless noted otherwise). then flip a single race token onto its in decline side in each region they occupy, and remove all other tokens of the race from the map and back into the tray. each player can only have a single race in decline on the map at a time. tokens from an earlier declined race are all immediately removed from the map and back into the tray, before flipping the new tokens into decline. the race banner of the vanished race is placed at the bottom of the stack of banners (or in the lowest empty slot in the banner column). the same is done when the last token of a declined race is taken off the map as the result of their last region being conquered. you can attempt no conquests during the turn your race goes into decline; your turn ends immediately after scoring. take 1 coin for each region your newly declined tokens occupy, but unless stated otherwise, none from that race’s power or discarded special power. on your next turn, select a new race and special power combo. then follow the first turn rules. your new race does not have to come onto the board in a region adjacent to your declined race. if there are not enough special powers left in the stack to keep putting out new combos, shuffle discarded special powers into a new stack.races amazons take 4 additional amazon tokens to be used only for conquest, not defense. at the end of each of your troop redeployments you must remove 4 tokens from the map (leaving at least 1 token in each of your regions if possible) and only take these 4 back in hand to redeploy once you ready your troops at the start of your next turn. dwarves collect 1 bonus coin for each mine region you occupy at turn’s end; even when the dwarves are in decline. elves when the enemy conquers one of your regions, keep all your elf tokens in hand for redeployment at the end of that player’s turn, rather than discarding 1. ghouls your ghoul tokens all stay on the map when going into decline, and can continue to conquer new regions each turn as if they were still active. these conquests must be done before any conquest by your active race (whom you may even attack). giants your giants may conquer any region adjacent to a mountain region they occupy at a cost of 1 less giant token than normal (a minimum of 1 is still required). halflings your halfling tokens may enter the map through any region. place a hole-in-the-ground in the first 2 regions you conquer, to make them immune to enemy conquests and racial and special powers. you remove the holes (and lose their protection) when your halflings go into decline, or you choose to abandon the region. humans collect 1 bonus coin for each farmland region you occupy at turn’s end. orcs collect 1 bonus coin for each non-empty region you conquered this turn. ratmen no race benefit other than their numbers. skeletons during your troop redeployment, take 1 new skeleton token from the tray for every 2 non-empty regions you conquered this turn, and add it to the troops you redeploy at the end of your turn. sorcerers once per turn per opponent, your sorcerers can conquer a region by substituting 1 of your opponent’s active tokens with one of your own from the tray. the replaced token must be the only token in its region (a single troll token with its lair is considered alone, and a fortress or mountain provides no protection) and that region must be adjacent to one of your sorcerers’. place the opponent’s token (even an elf) back into the tray.tritons your tritons may conquer all coastal regions (those bordering a sea or lake) at a cost of 1 less token than normal. a minimum of 1 is still required. trolls place a troll’s lair in each region your trolls occupy to increase its defense by 1. lairs stay in the region after your trolls go into decline. remove the lair if you abandon the region or when an enemy conquers it. wizards collect 1 bonus coin for each magic source region you occupy at turn’s end. special powers alchemist collect 2 bonus coins at the end of each turn your race hasn’t yet gone into decline. berserk you may use the reinforcement die before each of your conquests. roll the die; select the region you wish to conquer; then place the required number of tokens (minus the die results) there. if you do not have enough tokens, this is your final conquest attempt for the turn. a minimum of 1 is still required. bivouacking deploy 5 encampment tokens in any of your region(s), during your troop redeployment phase. each counts as 1 token toward its region’s defense (and thus protects a single race token from the sorcerer’s racial power). multiple encampments may be placed in the same region for a higher defense bonus. each turn you may break camp and settle in any new region you occupy. encampments are never lost during an attack on their region, but all disappear when their race goes into decline. commando you may conquer any region with 1 less token than normal. a minimum of 1 is still required. diplomat at the end of your turn, you may select 1 opponent whose active race you did not attack this turn as your ally. he cannot attack your active race until your next turn. you may change allies each turn. declined tokens are not affected (declined ghouls are immune and may still attack you). dragon master once per turn, you may conquer a region using 1 token, regardless of the number of defending tokens. place your dragon there to make the region immune to enemy conquests and racial and special powers until your dragon moves. during each new turn, you may move your dragon to a different region you wish to conquer. your dragon is removed from the board when you go into decline.flying you may conquer any region except seas and lakes. forest collect 1 bonus coin for each forest region you occupy at turn’s end. fortified once per turn while active, place 1 fortress in a region you occupy to increase its defense by 1 (even if you are entering or are in decline) and collect 1 bonus coin at turn’s end (unless you leave or are in decline). remove the fortress if you abandon the region or when an enemy conquers it. there is a maximum of 1 fortress per region and 6 fortresses on the map. heroic at the end of your turn, place your 2 heroes in 2 regions you occupy; the regions are now immune to enemy conquests and racial and special powers until your heroes move. heroes disappear when you go into decline. hill collect 1 bonus coin for each hill region you occupy at turn’s end. merchant collect 1 bonus coin for each region you occupy at turn’s end. mounted you may conquer any hill or farmland region with 1 less token than normal. a minimum of 1 is still required. pillaging at the end of the turn, collect 1 bonus coin for each non-empty region you conquered this turn. seafaring you may conquer seas and lakes as if they were empty regions. you keep these regions even after going into decline. spirit when declined, your spirit race tokens never count toward the ‘only 1 race in decline at a time’ limit. if a third race you control goes into decline, your spirits remain on the board and the other declines race disappears as normal. stout you may go in decline at the end of a turn of conquests, after scoring. swamp collect 1 bonus coin for each swamp region you occupy at turn’s end. underworld conquer any cavern region with 1 less token than normal. a minimum of 1 is still required. all cavern regions are considered adjacent to each other for your conquests. wealthy collect 7 bonus coins at the end of your first turn."
176,38453,SPACE ALERT,2008,CZECH GAMES EDITION,2.9689,805,"setup choose a difficulty level for common threats: lower (white icon), higher (yellow icon), or random (a mix of both types). shuffle an external common threat deck (purple cards) and an internal common threat deck (green) with this difficulty level. choose a difficulty level for serious threats as above and prepare external and internal serious threat decks. the difficulty level for serious threats can be different from that chosen for common threats, but in each case, the internal and external threat deck should be at the same level. each player chooses a color. choose players to take the roles of captain, communications officer, and chief of security. one player may take multiple roles. set up the boards as shown in the rulebook. choose a soundtrack. for a full game (a mission) choose one of the 8 mission tracks from the sountrack’s mission folder. fewer than 4 players for a 3 player game, use 1 android (a crew member with no designated player). for a 2 player game, use 2 androids. each android has an action board and a crew member figure, but only gets 1 card – a heroic action card dealt facedown on the first row of its action board. the android is the only crew member who can use its heroic action card. in a 3 player game, each player gets 6 cards per phase (in the first phase, one of the 6 is a heroic action card). in a 2 player game, each player gets 9 cards for the first phase and 6 cards for each of the other 2 phases (in the first phase, one of the 9 is a heroic action card). decide the order in which the androids will play (ie, where they would be sitting if they were players). any player may plan an action for any android by playing one of his own action cards (not a heroic action card) faceup on the android’s action board. once a card is played for an android, it cannot be moved or taken back. reveal an android’s heroic action at the start of the first phase. unconfirmed reports do not apply in games with less than 5 players. each android should be assigned a player to execute its actions during the resolution round. treat all android actions exactly as you do player actions. cards and rules that refer to players also apply to androids. action round start the soundtrack or start reading the scenario card. all players pick up their 5 first phase action cards. you cannot show your cards to other players, but you may talk about them. all players plan their actions for the first phase by playing their cards facedown on the 1-3 spaces of their action board. you can play your card with either half on top. from the card back, anyone can see whether the action half or the movement half is on top. your action for that turn is determined by the top half of the card; the bottom half has no effect. if no card is on a space, you take no action on that turn.when planning actions for a phase, you can change the cards you played any time before you end the phase. end the first phase by picking up your second phase cards (and adding them to the cards left over from the first phase). once you pick up your second phase cards, start planning actions for turns 4-7. you can look at your first phase cards, but you can no longer change them. you can plan second phase actions until you pick up your third phase cards. this starts your third phase, during which you plan actions 8-12 until the end of the action round. heroic actions also have a movement half and an action half and are played the same way. during the action round, you may use the game boards and pieces to indicate what you are planning, but only your planned actions have any effect on the game. 1. computer announcements alert. enemy activity detected. please begin first phase. indicates the beginning of the action round. time t+1 (2, 3, etc.). threat.

the threat cards the proper trajectories and numbers. correct any mistakes, adding any missing threats. move the mission step marker along the mission steps board, executing the steps as follows: 1. threat appears if there is a threat card with this number, place a second token with the same number on the first space of the threat’s trajectory board. for an external threat, this token represents its position. for an internal threat, this token keeps track of its progress. for a malfunction, take an oval token with the indicated letter and use it to cover the letter of the affected system in the indicated station. do this for each affected system if more than one is indicated. for an intruder, take the oval token with the intruder’s picture and place it in the indicated initial station. 2. player actions players reveal their action for this turn (flip cards left-to- right so the top half stays on top). players take their actions in order, starting with the captain and going clockwise. if you misplayed your card either by playing it upside-down or by mixing up red and blue arrows, you can say, “oops, i tripped”. perform the action you intended instead of the one shown by your misplayed card, but your next turn’s action is delayed. a delayed action means: the card, if any, that was planned is moved to one turn later. if there is a card there, it is moved one turn later as well, and so on until you move a card into an empty space or until you reach your last action. if your last turn’s action has to be moved, it is moved off your board and you do not get to execute it. red and blue arrows: move your figure through the door and into the adjacent station in the indicated direction. you do not switch decks. if your figure is already in the zone of the ship of that color, it does not move. gravolift move: move your figure to the adjacent station on the other deck. you do not change zones. if the gravolift is damaged, or another player used it before you on this turn, make your move anyway, but your next turn’s action is delayed. system activation or repair: activate or repair the indicated system in your figure’s station. if the system is malfunctioning (indicated by an oval token) this action is a repair. add 1 red block to the malfunction’s card. if the card now has at least as many red blocks as it has hit points, the malfunction is repaired: give the card to the captain and remove its token from the internal threat trajectory board; also remove its oval token (or tokens) from the spaceship board. if the malfunction cannot be repaired (because it executed its z action) your action has no effect. if the system is affected by several malfunctions, the repair action acts on the repairable malfunction with the lowest numbered token (even if the system is also affected by an unrepairable malfunction). the oval token is removed only if all malfunctions affecting the system are repaired. if the system is functional (no oval token), this action indicates activation of the system. action a is firing the weapon at that station. action b is an energy transfer. action c has a station-specific meaning.firing a heavy laser or the pulse cannon: take a green energy block from the reactor in the same zone and place it on the weapon you are firing to denote activation. if the reactor has no blocks or if the weapon already has one block, this action has no effect. firing a light laser cannon: take the yellow block from the power pack below the cannon and place on the cannon to denote activation. if this has already been done this turn, your action has no effect. transferring energy to shield: add green blocks to the shield from the reactor in the same zone until the shield is at maximum capacity. if there are not enough green blocks to fill it, move all there are. transferring energy to lateral reactor: add green blocks to the lateral reactor from the central reactor until the lateral reactor is at maximum capacity. if there are not enough green blocks to fill it, move all there are. re-fueling central reactor: return 1 fuel capsule to the bank. add green blocks to the central reactor from the bank until it is at maximum capacity. if there is no fuel capsule, your action has no effect. maintaining the computer: take 1 block from the computer on the bridge and place it on the computer maintenance step of the mission steps board in the row corresponding to the current player action step. if a block is already there, this action has no effect. launching a rocket: take 1 rocket figure from the station and place it on the first square of the rocket track. if there are no rockets left in the station or if this square is already occupied, this action has no effect. activating or re-activating a battlebot squad: if you are not leading a battlebot squad, take the battlebot squad figure lying in storage in that station and set it upright next to your figure. for the rest of the game, the battlebot squad figure moves with your figure. if the battlebot squad in this station has already been activated, this action has no effect. if you are leading a disabled battlebot squad (lying next to your figure) set the battlebot squad figure upright. your battlebots are active once again. if you are leading an active battlebot squad, this action has no effect. taking off in the interceptors: if you are leading an active battlebot squad, move your figure and the squad figure off the ship into space. if you have no battlebot squad, if you are leading a disabled battlebot squad, or if another player’s figure is already in space, this action has no effect. when you are in space, you are not in any station or zone. threat actions and effects that knock out, delay, or otherwise affect players on the ship do not apply to you. delays due to failure to maintain the computer do not affect you either. interceptors attack threats on the turn you take off. attacking with the interceptors on subsequent turns: if you start the turn in space, your only legal action is : this keeps you in space and initiates another attack with the interceptors. if you take no action, you and your battlebot squad return to the ship in the upper red station. any other action or movement is delayed (the delayed action is shifted ahead one turn, creating a ‘no action’ representing your return from space). performing visual confirmation: at the end of the player actions step, take a block from the window and place it on the numbered square on the mission steps board that corresponds to the current phase and the number of players that performed visual confirmation on this turn. if there is already a block on a lower square, move it to the new square instead of taking a new block from the spaceship board. if there is already a block on that square or a higher square, this action has no effect. attacking with the battlebot squad: if you are leading an active battlebot squad in a station, your battlebot squad attacks an intruder in that station. place 1 red block on the intruder’s card. if the intruder has at least as many red blocks as hit points, it is destroyed. give the card to the captain, remove the intruder’s numbered token from the internal threat trajectory board, and remove the intruder’s oval token from the spaceship board. if the intruder has the symbol, it returns fire. your battlebot squad is disabled. lay its figure down next to yours (it continues to follow your figure). if there are multiple intruders in your station, your battle- bot squad attacks the one with the lowest numbered token. if you are leading a disabled battlebot squad, if you are not leading a battlebot squad, or if there is no intruder in your station, this action has no effect. attacking with interceptors: if you are leading an active battlebot squad in space, this action keeps you in space as described above. heroic actions heroic movement: move your figure directly to the indicated station, regardless of how many other stations and damaged gravolifts are in between. heroic shooting: fire the weapon at your station according to the rules for executing action . for this turn, the weapon has 1 extra strength. this also applies to the pulse cannon. heroic energy transfer: transfer energy according to the rules for executing action . if this transfers at least 1 block of energy, add an extra block from the bank to the receiving energy system. this may allow a reactor or shield to exceed its maximum capacity, and even works when refueling the central reactor. heroic repair: if this is used as a repair action, give the malfunction 2 red blocks instead of 1. heroic battlebot attack: battlebots attack an intruder according to the rules for action . even if the intruder returns fire , the battlebots are not disabled. in space, interceptors attack according to the rules for action but with 1 extra strength. 3. compute damage compute damage to external threats in this step. nothing in this section applies to internal threats or the internal threat trajectory board. all cannons with a green or yellow block do damage. a rocket on the second square of the rocket track does damage. interceptors do damage if there is a player in space. trajectories are divided into three distances. the five squares nearest the ship are at distance 1. the next five squares are at distance 2. the rest of the trajectory is at distance 3. each weapon has a range (indicated by 1, 2, or 3 squares) and a strength (yellow number).determine which threats are targeted by which weapons. text on a card may modify the ways in which it can be targeted. if a weapon has no targetable threat within range, it does no damage. laser cannons can target a threat at any distance but only target 1 threat in their zone. if there are multiple threats, they target the threat closest to the ship. if multiple threats are on the closest occupied square of the trajectory board, the lowest numbered one is targeted. the pulse cannon targets all threats in all zones within its range of 1 or 2. rockets target the closest threat on any zone’s trajectory. if multiple threats are the same number of squares away, the rocket targets the lowest numbered one is targeted. if there is no targetable threat at distance 1 or 2, the rocket is returned to the bank without doing damage. interceptors target all threats within a range of 1. if there is only one threat at range 1, interceptors attack it at strength 3. if there are multiple threats at range 1, interceptors attack all of them at strength 1. for each threat, add up the strengths of all weapons that targeted it, then subtract the threat’s shield points to get the damage dealt to the threat. if the result is 0 or less, the threat takes no damage. otherwise, place 1 block on the threat card for each point of damage dealt. if the number of damage blocks on the threat card is equal to or greater than its hit points, the threat is destroyed. give the card to the captain and remove the threat’s numbered token from the trajectory board. excess damage is not applied to other threats, not even if it is from multiple weapons. all targeting happens before any threat is removed.s after all damage is computed, remove any green energy blocks from the cannons and place them in the bank. remove any rocket on the second square of the rocket track and place it in the bank. remove any yellow energy blocks from the light laser cannons and return them to their cannons’ power packs. 4. threat actions threat tokens advance in order, starting with the one with the lowest number. when a threat’s token advances, it may perform one or more actions. after all threat tokens have advanced, move any rocket on the first square of the rocket track to the second square. a threat’s token advances on its trajectory board a number of squares equal to its speed. if it lands on or passes over a square labeled x, y, or z, it immediately performs the indicated action. if it passes over multiple such squares, it performs all the actions in order. when a threat gets to the end of its trajectory board it performs its z action and can no longer be affected by the players’ actions. give its card to the communications officer and remove its token from the trajectory board. it will take no more actions. for an intruder that has performed its z action, also remove its oval token from the spaceship board. for a malfunction, however, the oval token remains: the affected system becomes unrepairable once the malfunction has performed its z action. attack n: an external threat’s attack of strength n on the zone corresponding to its trajectory. the attack does n damage to that zone, but each energy block in that zone’s shield reduces the damage by 1 (return the block to the bank). remove all blocks and the remaining damage is applied to that zone. for each point of damage remaining, draw 1 octagonal damage tile from the zone’s damage tile stack and place it on the part of the ship depicted. that system becomes less effective.tiles may reduce the strength of light or heavy laser cannons, reduce the range of the pulse cannon, reduce the capacity of a shield or reactor (any excess energy is immediately returned to the bank), or damage a gravolift (gravolift actions in this zone will delay the following turn’s action). structural damage has no special effect. each zone has 6 damage tokens. if you have to draw a seventh, the zone is destroyed and your crew loses the game. attack n on all zones: attacks on multiple zones are dealt with from left to right (red, white, blue). each zone has to deal with an attack of strength n. attack equal to its remaining hitpoints: the strength of this attack is determined by subtracting the red blocks on the card from the threat’s hit points. deal(s) n damage: internal threats deal damage that is not affected by shields. the damage is done to the zone where the internal threat’s oval token is. draw that many damage tiles. +(-)n shield point(s). +(-)n speed. shield points = n: some threats can change their parameters. use black blocks to indicate reductions and white blocks to indicate increases. heals (repairs) n damage: remove n red damage blocks from the threat’s card. if the threat has fewer than n damage blocks, remove them all. move(s) left. move(s) right. change(s) decks: internal threats use these actions to move about the ship. move the threat’s oval token into the indicated adjacent station. internal threats can change decks regardless of the state of the gravolift. (all players on ship, players in this station, players in this zone) are delayed: players in the specified group have their next turn’s action delayed. (all players, players in that station, etc.) are knocked out: the specified players are knocked out of the game. lay their figures down on the board; their remaining actions have no effect. you may still complete the mission even with all players knocked out. if a player leading a battlebot squad is knocked out of the mission, lay the battlebot squad figure on its side as well. it will be disabled for the rest of the mission. takes over ship. destroys ship. ship breaks apart: an action indicating that something final has happened to the ship means that the players immediately lose, regardless of damage. 5. computer maintenance check there should be a block here when the mission step marker gets to this space. if there is not, the players have failed to maintain the computer in the first two turns of the phase. each player’s next turn’s action is delayed. 6. rocket resolution in the thirteenth turn, players get no actions. however, a rocket fired in the twelfth turn will still be flying toward its target: compute its damage in this step. any player out in space with the interceptors also returns to the ship. threats also get 1 more threat actions step on the thirteenth turn. scoring if you complete the mission, you can count up your score. you don’t get any score when you lose. threats you survived (kept by the communications officer) earn the lower point value. threats you destroyed (kept by the captain) earn the higher point value. add up these points and from the total subtract the following penalties:• total damage done to all zones of the ship. • damage done to the most damaged zone. • 2 points for each player knocked out of the mission. • 1 point for each battlebot squad that is still disabled when the mission ends. finally, add in any points for visual confirmation (these should have been marked with blocks on the mission steps board). the result is your score, which you can write into your ship’s log. variants fifth crew member use androids to bring your crew size up to 5 instead of 4. in this case, unconfirmed reports apply to your game. deal out as many cards as you would for a crew of 4 (without the extra android) except that in the first phase, each player gets 1 extra card. solo space alert play with 4 androids (ignore unconfirmed reports). deal each android a facedown heroic action for the first phase. spread the entire action card deck faceup in front of you. start the soundtrack, and reveal the heroic actions. begin planning first phase actions. each android can use any action card, but only its own heroic action. you are allowed to change planned cards until the soundtrack announces the end of the respective phase. ignore announcements like data transfer, incoming data, and communication system down. exploration campaign an exploration campaign consists of up to 3 consecutive missions. you may decide to quit the campaign and score points (see rulebook for scoring) for only one or two missions. if you lose on any mission, you lose the entire campaign. before each mission, first agree on a difficulty level for normal and for serious threats, and then choose a random soundtrack.play through the mission as normal. if your ship is destroyed, the campaign is unsuccessful. repairs damage to your ship is cumulative throughout the campaign. all oval tokens are removed, so systems that were affected by malfunctions are automatically repaired. knocked out players, damage tiles, and disabled battlebots are repaired as follows: • a knocked out player (even one knocked out in space) returns for the next mission, but cannot repair anything. • a player who was not knocked out can repair one damage tile or one disabled battlebot squad. shuffle repaired damage tiles back into their stacks. in each zone, no more than two damage tiles can be repaired. after discussing repairs, players play in order, starting with the captain. each player either recovers from being knocked out, repairs one damage tile, or repairs one battlebot squad. androids can make repairs according to the same rules; their repair decision is handled by a designated player. remaining damage tiles have their usual effects in the next mission. in addition: • unrepaired reactors and shields have (besides reduced capacity) one less block during setup. • unrepaired structural damage means that damage to its zone is doubled (draw 2 damage tiles for each point of damage that gets past the shields). this only applies to structural damage from a previous mission. • an unrepaired battlebot squad is not placed on the spaceship board. if you only get to place one squad, choose its initial station.

there is no maximum range. roll the light (white) or heavy (red) dice according to the reference chart. if the total is greater than the target’s armour value the target loses 1 life point for each point you exceeded the value. all miniatures except the marine commander and the dreadnought have 1 lp. heavy weapons assault cannon: the total rolled may be split between any visible targets. destroying a miniature may make others visible. plasma gun: the total rolled is compared against every miniature in a straight line of fire. missile launcher: a miniature in the target square is attacked with the total rolled; miniatures in adjacent squares are attacked with the higher of the 2 dice. hand-to-hand (h-to-h) combat a miniature may only engage in h-to-h combat with a miniature in a square before, behind or to the sides. both players roll dice as shown on their reference sheet. whoever rolls the most wins; the loser loses 1 lp for each point by which he lost. on a draw neither loses any lp.the dreadnought the dreadnought occupies 4 squares. count movement from the front of its base and change direction by moving on the spot. a dreadnought may not finish its turn under a door. dreadnoughts may fire, one at a time, all 3 of their weapons (bolters plus 2 heavy weapons) per turn, and at separate targets if desired. los must be traced from at least one of the 4 squares it occupies. remove one of the dreadnought’s heavy weapons when it loses a lp. it is destroyed when it loses its third lp. alien reinforcement the alien player begins with a number of reinforcement tokens, depending on the mission. he may choose and play up to 6 tokens at the end of his turn. if there are no blips or alien miniatures on the board he must play 6 tokens, or as many as are available. the token is placed faceup off the board and the corresponding miniature is placed on any of the squares marked with an r on the mission map. they may not be placed within los of a marine. scoring collecting blips when a marine eliminates an alien take the corresponding faceup blip or reinforcement token for that alien and score the points shown. if there is no token available no points are scored. eliminating marines when an alien eliminates a marine take the miniature and score points as follows: each marine eliminated: 5 points each heavy weapon marine or commander: 10 points the marine player loses the same amount of points. mission completion a marine player who completes the primary mission receives the primary mission token and 30 points. a marine player who completes the secondary mission receives the secondary mission token and 15 points. once the mission has been accomplished, marines must return to their own docking board. once on a docking board a miniature is safe from attack and may not fire or return to the board. if the marines fail to complete the mission they may still escape to their docking boards. the alien player takes the primary mission token and points, and the secondary mission and points if this was read out but not accomplished.game end the game ends once the marines have returned to their docking boards or as soon as the alien player draws his last event card. in the latter case the marines have one last turn each. any marines left on the board at the end of this turn are eliminated. count up points; the player with the highest total wins. campaign games players may play a linked series of games to form a campaign. at the end of each game compare points totals to the combat effectiveness table. marine players for each honour badge the player may take an additional equipment card. each game won promotes the player 1 rank. for each rank promoted he may take an additional order card. a player may never have more than 8 equipment cards and 4 order cards. alien players for each mark of chaos the player may add 1 to the number of reinforcement tokens he is allowed to use for a mission (choose randomly from those not listed for the mission). each game won promotes the player 1 rank. for each rank promoted he may take an alien event card at the start of the game that can be used on any turn instead of drawing a card. winning the campaign between games casualties are replaced, but if a marine commander was eliminated the player begins with a sergeant. any honour badges the player had are lost. a player reaching the highest rank wins the campaign. a player may trade in 4 honour badges or marks of chaos (a maximum of 4 may be held) to move up 1 rank. you cannot reach the highest rank this way. mission: dreadnought extra-heavy weapons order and equipment cards for heavy weapons may not be used for extra-heavy weapons. each extra-heavy weapon is worth 10 points to the alien player. las-cannon the las-cannon may fire 3 shots in a turn, (all 3 either before or after the marine moves). each shot affects an area of 4 squares. only squares that the marine can trace los to are affected. each time you fire, roll 1 heavy weapons die; each miniature in the affected squares is attacked with the score rolled. you may choose to concentrate one or more shots into the same area; roll 2 or 3 dice as appropriate and use the total. fusion gun the fusion gun fires at all miniatures in a straight line of squares: horizontal, vertical or diagonal. the line of fire is blocked by a wall or door. every miniature in this line is attacked separately by the a total rolled on 3 dice.conversion beam the conversion beam fires at all miniatures in a straight line of squares: horizontal, vertical or diagonal. the line of fire (and the explosion) is blocked by a wall or door. the last square in the line of fire is attacked by the total rolled on all dice, and the impact causes an explosion which attacks all adjacent squares with the total rolled minus 1. squares back along the line of fire are also affected; each successive square is attacked with a total equal to 1 less than the score on the square before it. therefore if it is fired at close range it may affect the firer. the tarantula the tarantula moves 6 squares, counted from the front edge, and may not move diagonally. it changes direction by pivoting around its middle square (this does not count as a square of movement) the tarantula occupies 3 squares in a straight line, vertically or horizontally. when moving, the tranatula may pass through marines but may not end its move if any of the 3 squares are occupied. some order cards allow the tarantula to move and/or fire several times in a single turn (by sections!, move it! and fire!). gunners the tarantula may only move or fire when manned by a marine, who must be equipped with the control console and standing in the square immediately behind it. marine gunners have their armour value increased to 4 if they are fired upon by a miniature within the tarantula’s arc of fire (aof). if the gunner is eliminated, the marine player may substitute another marine to act as gunner on his turn, who exchanges his current weapon for the control console. he may not move or fire the tarantula that turn unless an order card has been played. if the tarantula is destroyed, the gunner may be armed with a bolter and continue as an ordinary marine. each gunner is worth 5 points to the alien player. a tarantula is worth 10 points. firing and h-to-h combat the tarantula may only fire at targets within its aof, and to which its gunner can trace a direct los. targets fully outside the aof cannot be fired at. the tarantula may fire 3 shots in a turn with its 2 las- cannons. for each of the shots roll 2 heavy weapons dice instead of 1. in h-to-h, the alien player must decide whether to attack the tarantula or the gunner. if the tarantula is attacked, it does not roll any dice, and is destroyed and removed from the board if the attacker rolls higher than its armour value of 6. new dreadnoughts any dreadnought fitted with the longer leg pieces may move 6 squares instead of 4. any dreadnought fitted with the larger top piece may be armed with 4 weapons instead of 2 (and it will take 5 hits to eliminate it).bulkheads bulkheads operate like normal doors except they cannot be opened by marines; to get through them they must be destroyed by rolling higher than their armour value of 4. marine commanders may also smash bulkheads in h-to-h combat. a destroyed bulkhead is removed from the board. the alien player may open bulkhead doors and close them at the end of his turn. eldar attack eldar weapons shuriken cannon the shuriken cannon may fire 3 times using 1 heavy weapons die and 1 light weapons die against up to 3 targets (resolve each shot separately). these attacks may be divided up before and after the eldar’s movement. las-cannon the las-cannon may fire 2 shots in a turn, (all 2 either before or after the marine moves). each shot affects an area of 4 squares. only squares that the eldar can trace los to are affected. each time you fire, roll 1 heavy weapons die; each miniature in the affected squares is attacked with the score rolled. you may choose to concentrate one or more shots into the same area; roll up to 2 dice as appropriate and use the total. h-to-h combat use 3 light weapons dice for normal warriors, but 2 dice for those carrying heavy weapons (house rule). exarchs an exarch chooses 5 exarch cards before beginning a mission. he may replenish his cards between missions. for each point of damage an exarch suffers, he must permanently discard 1 exarch card of his choice. once he has lost all his cards he is counted as having 1 lp. an exarch may divide his shots before and after his move, and may shoot at different targets (resolve each separately). boarding a space hulk at the start of a mission, the eldar player places his psychic screen entrance piece on the entrance board. on his turn, the eldar move out of the screen and begin their move on the square in front of it. from the moment the first eldar has moved out, the alien player may place any blip he wishes onto that board. when an eldar squad completes its mission, they must all move back through the screen to end the mission. eldar campaign games see p.10 of the rulebook for eldar honours. each eldar warrior is worth 5 points (10 points with a heavy weapon, or an exarch) to the eldar and the alien’s combat effectiveness rating score."

the current player must resolve his decision. the event card is then revealed to all players and resolved. a player must always choose a valid target for event card abilities (if able). b. resolve genestealer activations each of the boxes on the bottom of the card are resolved from left to right, either spawning new genestealers, or moving existing swarms. the formation the central line of space marine cards is the formation. space marines may only exist in the formation, and may not move outside of this column. each row of the formation is known as a position. whenever a space marine is slain, the formation needs to shift to fill in his previous position. action card types support take 1 support token (from the unused token supply) and place it on any space marine card (even a marine controlled by another player, or a card that already has support tokens on it). a player may discard a support token from one of his marines attacking or defending to reroll a die he just rolled. the rerolled result must be used instead (unless he rerolls again by spending another token, or with an ability). support tokens can only be discarded in this way if the marine is facing the attacking or defending swarm. support tokens remain on marine cards until discarded by a card effect or spent to reroll a die. you may only spend tokens from marines you control. move + activate perform any or all of the following steps (in order): a. move to adjacent position move any marines matching the action’s combat team one at a time, in any order. switch the position of the marine card with any adjacent marine belonging to any player. do not change either’s facing. each marine of the card’s team may only be moved once during each move action. all terrain cards and genestealers remain in their previous positions. b. change facing change the facing of any marine in the combat team, including those who moved, by flipping the card so the arrow is pointing in the opposite direction. c. activate terrain activate any terrain cards with the term activate that one of your marines is in front of (facing and in the same position). follow the instructions on the card. each may only be activated once per round.attack choose your marines one at a time (in any order), then choose which genestealer swarm the marine is attacking. roll the combat die. on a , choose one of the genestealer cards to be discarded. any other result is a miss. facing and range to attack a genestealer swarm, the marine card must be facing the swarm, and be within range. the current facing of a marine is the direction the facing indicator (the large arrow) on his card is pointing. marine cards list the maximum range (number of positions away) they may attack. a marine with a “range 0 attack” may only attack swarms he is engaged with (those on his position). genestealers blip piles during setup (and each time marines travel to a new location), 2 facedown blip piles are formed; one each to the left and right of the location card. the number of genestealer cards in each pile is listed on the bottom corners of the current location card. spawning genestealers when a genestealer is spawned, the current player takes the top card of a blip pile and places it faceup in the appropriate position and side of the formation. when the activation area of an event card spawns genestealers, a number of genestealer cards are spawned on each position of the formation that contains the appropriate terrain card type (red, orange, yellow, or green). the number of coloured boxes on a terrain card is a reminder of how likely genestealers spawn there from event cards (4 red boxes is the most frequent). the bottom of each setup location card lists how many genestealers are spawned by each major spawn (yellow triangle) and minor spawn (white triangle). if there are multiple terrain cards in play of the same colour, the listed amount of genestealers are spawned on each of the terrain cards. card abilities that spawn genestealers may spawn them in positions that do not contain terrain cards.spawning genestealers are always drawn from the blip pile on the side on which they are being spawned. if that pile is empty, the genestealer is not spawned. if there are not enough cards to spawn the full amount, the current player must spawn as many as able (of his choice). moving genestealers each genestealer card may either move or flank, at maximum, once during each event phase. a genestealer’s type is indicated by the icon on the card’s lower left corner. moving every swarm that contains this type of genestealer moves to an adjacent position. the swarm always moves following the small arrows on its side of the engaged marine card. if the swarm would move off the top or bottom of the formation, it flanks instead. flanking every swarm that contains this type of genestealer moves behind its marine (the side of the formation the marine is not facing). if the swarm is already behind the marine, it does not move. brood lords the 2 brood lord cards are never shuffled into the genestealer deck or into a blip pile. they only spawn when specified by a location card, and spawn without being in blip piles. they have 2 movement icons, and their swarm will move when either is activated. a brood lord must be the last genestealer in the swarm to be slain. when a swarm containing a brood lord attacks, subtract 1 from its die roll. travel players need to travel to new locations to reach the final card in the location deck and win the game. travelling refers to the entire formation going to a new location; marines and genestealers move within the formation. travelling automatically occurs whenever there are 0 cards in any blip pile at the end of any phase. when there are no cards in the location deck the marines stay at their current location until they win or lose the game. when travelling, all genestealers engaged with marines remain in the formation. engaged genestealers only leave play from the “door” terrain card’s ability or if discarded by a different card or ability. perform the following steps in order:1. place new location card place the top card of the location deck faceup on top of the current location card (do not cover the spawn numbers at the bottom of the setup location card). this is now the current location. 2. place terrain cards the current player discards all terrain cards from the formation. he then places the appropriate terrain cards as listed on the current location card (the 2 white icons on the left and the 2 white icons on the right of the location card). if the arrow next to a terrain icon is pointing down, the matching terrain card is placed the printed number of positions from the top of the formation. if the arrow is pointing up, it is placed the printed number of positions from the bottom of the formation. if the number exceeds the number of marines remaining in the formation, the card is placed in the last valid position. 3. discard/refill blip piles all cards that remain in the blip pile(s) are discarded. cards are then added to each blip pile from the genestealer deck until each pile contains the number listed on the location card. 4. follow location ability (if necessary) if the current location card has an “upon entering” ability, it is resolved now. if the card has an “activate control panel” ability, it is resolved each time a “control panel” terrain card is used while this is the current location. slain space marines if a marine is slain (usually by being attacked by a swarm), his card is removed from the formation and returned to the box. the formation is then shifted. if both marines of a combat team are eliminated, all action cards for that combat team are removed from the game. they may no longer be used, but the player may still win if the remaining marines win. if the card of the current player is removed in this way, the player with the lowest numbered action card remaining becomes the current player. shifting the formation the formation must shift to fill in the previous position of a slain marine. take every terrain, marine, and genestealer card in the smaller segment of the formation and move them to fill in the slain marine’s previous position. the smaller segment is the half of the formation that contains the least marine cards. if both segments are even, the bottom segment is shifted up. a genestealer swarm may move onto another swarm. if this happens during the genestealer attack phase, swarms that have already attacked during this phase remain separate from those that have not. at the end of the event phase, all swarms in the same position and side of the formation merge. after shifting, it is possible for more than 1 terrain card to be in the same position. if a marine is ever able to move to a non- adjacent position (with a card or ability), he does not cause the formation to shift. he switches places with the marine that occupied his new position. component limitations components are limited to those provided. spent or discarded support tokens return to the unused token pile. if a player is instructed to place a token when there are none in this pile, he loses the ability to place that token. discarded cards are placed faceup in a discard pile adjacent to the appropriate deck. when a deck runs out (excluding the location deck) its discard pile is shuffled to form a new deck. if there are not enough genestealer cards left when creating blip piles, the current player places as many cards as able into each pile (as equally as possible).1 to 3 players with 3 or less players, each player chooses more than one combat team marker during setup as follows (go around the table more than once): 3 players: 2 markers per player 2 players: 2 markers per player 1 player: 3 markers during the choose actions phase, each player chooses one card matching the colour of each of his combat team markers. he resolves each chosen card during the resolve actions phase (in standard ascending order). the term “your space marines” on action cards only refers to marines matching the card’s combat team."

edge with his ships, squadrons, and cards. set each shield dial and squadron disk to its maximum appropriate values, and each squadron’s activation slider to blue. assign the appropriate defense tokens to each ship and unique squadron. take enough command dials and speed dials for your fleet. assign id tokens to ships and squadrons as necessary. the player with the lowest total fleet point cost chooses the first player (on a tie, flip a coin to decide who chooses). the first player places the initiative token next to his edge, blue side up. the first player looks at all 3 of his opponent’s objectives cards and chooses one to be the objective for the game. starting with the second player, players take turns choosing and placing 6 obstacles into the setup area, beyond distance 3 of the play area edges and beyond distance 1 of each other. starting with the first player, players take turns deploying forces. a deployment turn consists of placing 1 ship or 2 squadrons. your ships must be placed within your deployment zone: within the setup area and at distance 1-3 of your edge. when you place a ship, set its speed dial to a speed available on its speed chart. your squadrons must be placed within distance 1-2 of a friendly ship. if you have only 1 squadron remaining when you must place 2, you cannot place it until you have placed all of your ships. shuffle the damage deck and place it next to the play area along with the command tokens, maneuver tool, range ruler, and the round token marked 1. finally, remove the setup area markers. during the first command phase, players must assign command dials to their ships so that each ship has a number of command dials equal to its command value. the game round the game is played over 6 rounds, each made up of 4 phases. the first player retains initiative for the entire game. 1. command phase on every round except the first, players secretly and simultaneously choose a command on 1 command dial for each of their ships. then place each dial facedown next to the ship’s ship card, under any other dials already assigned to that ship. 2. ship phase starting with the player with initiative, players take turns choosing one of their ships and activating it by following these steps: 1. reveal command dial reveal the top command dial on your chosen ship’s stack of dials and place it faceup next to the ship. if you want to resolve the revealed command for its full effect this round, you may spend the dial at the appropriate time to do so. if you want to reserve it for a later round, spend the dial by placing it faceup on its ship card and place the matching command token next to the ship. you can spend both a command dial and a command token to combine their effects, and you can resolve numerous commands in the same round. the maximum number of command tokens that a ship can have is equal to its command value, and a ship cannot have more than 1 of each type of command token. a token can be spent in the same round it was gained. 2. attack the ship can perform up to 2 attacks. each attack must originate from a different hull zone, and the target must be inside that hull zone’s firing arc. the target of the attack can be either 1 hull zone of an enemy ship or 1 or more enemy squadrons. 3. execute maneuver the ship must execute a maneuver using the maneuver tool. the distance moved corresponds to its current speed on its speed dial. 1. determine course reset the maneuver tool so it is straight. each column on the ship’s speed chart corresponds to the speed number at the bottom of the column. a column shows the number of times each joint can be clicked while going at that speed. each row corresponds to a joint on the maneuver tool; the row above the speed number relates to the first joint, the second row relates to the second joint, etc. i means the joint can be clicked once in either direction, ii means it can be clicked twice and - means it must remain straight. you may place the maneuver tool on the table to determine possible ship positions before committing to the move. 2. move ship place the maneuver tool on one side of your ship with the plastic guides of its flat end sliding into the notches on the side of the ship’s base. ensure the front of the ship is parallel with the raised line above the guides. pick up the ship and place it at the joint below the number that corresponds to the ship’s current speed. the notches on the ship’s base slide over that joint’s plastic guides. the ship’s starting and final positions must be on the same side of the tool. the tool cannot be placed so that the ship overlaps the tool when placed in its final position (if so, place the tool on the other side of the ship’s base before the move). after a ship finishes its activation, place the revealed dial faceup on its ship card to indicate the ship has activated. the opposing player then activates one of his own unactivated ships. a player who does not have any unactivated ships must pass his turn. repeat until both players have activated all of their ships. 3. squadron phase starting with the player with initiative, players take turns activating any squadrons that were not activated by a command during the ship phase. each squadron that activates during this phase may either move or attack, but not both. choose 1 of your unactivated squadrons and activate it. then you must activate a second unactivated squadron, if able. when you activate a squadron, push its activation slider to the other side. then your opponent activates 2 of his own squadrons in the same way. repeat until all squadrons are activated. squadron movement to move a squadron, place the range ruler on the table, distance side faceup, with the distance 1 end of the ruler in contact with any part of the squadron’s base. then place the squadron at any point along the ruler. it cannot be placed with any portion of its base beyond the distance band matching the squadron’s speed. a squadron cannot be placed with any part of its base overlapping another squadron or ship. squadron attacks a squadron can attack either 1 enemy squadron or 1 hull zone of an enemy ship. squadrons have a 360° firing arc; a squadron can attack any target at distance 1. engagement while a squadron’s starting or final position is at distance 1 of an enemy squadron, those squadrons are engaged. an engaged squadron cannot move. when an engaged squadron attacks, it must attack a squadron instead of attacking a ship. if los between the squadrons is obstructed, they are not engaged even if at distance 1 of each other, though they can still attack each other. 4. status phase players ready their exhausted defense tokens by flipping them to their readied side. the player with initiative flips the initiative token over. the color and icon on the token matches that of unactivated squadrons in the next round. reveal the round token with the next highest number to indicate the round number for the next round. commands navigate spend this command dial to increase or decrease the ship’s movement speed by 1. also, it may adjust 1 joint by 1 click more than the speed chart normally allows. the minimum speed for all ships is 0; the maximum speed is shown on the speed chart. a ship with a command token may spend the token when determining its move to increase or decrease its speed by 1. squadron spend this command dial to activate a number of friendly squadrons at close-medium range up to the ship’s squadron value. each activated squadron can attack and move in either order. choose and activate squadrons one at a time. a ship with a command token may spend the token after revealing its command dial to activate 1 squadron as above.repair spend this command dial to gain engineering points equal to the ship’s engineering value. it may spend these points as follows in any combination and number: 1 pt: move 1 shield from one of the ship’s hull zones to another of its hull zones (without exceeding the hull zone’s maximum shield value). 2 pts: recover 1 shield in any of the ship’s hull zones. 3 pts: discard any 1 of the ship’s faceup or facedown damage cards. engineering points do not persist from round to round. a ship with a command token may spend the token after revealing its command dial to gain engineering points equal to half of its engineering value, rounded up, to spend on the above effects. concentrate fire spend this command dial to roll 1 additional attack die after the ship rolls dice during an attack. the die must be of a color that it already rolled. a ship with a command token may spend the token after it rolls dice during an attack to reroll 1 attack die. attacking 1. declare target choose 1 of your ship’s hull zones to attack from, then declare the defending hull zone on the target ship (it must be within the zone’s firing arc and in range). 2. roll attack dice determine your attack dice, as shown on the attacking hull zone and allowed by the range, then roll them. 3. resolve attack effects resolve effects that modify the dice. for each accuracy icon rolled, you may choose 1 of the defender’s defense tokens; the chosen token cannot be spent during this attack. 4. spend defense tokens the defender can spend 1 or more of his defense tokens. 5. resolve damage the attacker can resolve 1 of its critical effects. the defender then suffers damage equal to the number of hit and critical icons remaining. for each hit rolled, the defender suffers 1 damage. for each critical rolled, if the attacker and defender are both ships, the defender suffers 1 damage and the first damage card dealt is dealt faceup. firing arc and range to measure a hull zone’s firing arc, use the range ruler to extend the zone’s firing arc lines on the ship token. if a portion of the target is inside the area between those extended firing arc lines, the target is inside the firing arc. use the range side of the range ruler to determine the range to the target. measure between the closest points of the appropriate hull zone(s) or squadron base(s). each range band shows which colors of attack dice you can roll. line of sight (los) an attacking ship or squadron must trace los to its target. when tracing los to or from a squadron, trace the line using the point on the squadron’s base that is closest to the opposing squadron or hull zone.when tracing los to or from a hull zone, trace the line using the yellow targeting point in that hull zone. if los is traced through any hull zone on the defending ship that is not the defending hull zone, the attacker does not have los and he must declare another target. if there is no valid target, he cannot perform an attack. if los is traced through obstacles or ships that are not the attacker or defender, the attack is obstructed. if los is drawn over an obstacle, the attack is obstructed even if the bases of the attacker and defender are touching. squadrons do not block or obstruct los, and the attacker’s hull zones do not block his los. when an attack is obstructed, the attacker rolls 1 less die of his choice. defense tokens redirect: choose 1 of your hull zones adjacent to the defending hull zone. any amount of damage may be suffered on the chosen zone’s remaining shields before the remaining damage must be suffered on the defending hull zone. evade: if the attack occurs at long range, the defender chooses and cancels 1 attack die. at medium range, choose 1 attack die to be rerolled. at close range and distance 1, the token has no effect. brace: after damage is totaled, reduce the total to half, rounded up. scatter: cancel all attack dice. contain: prevent the attacker from resolving the standard critical effect. the attacker can still resolve a non-standard critical effect (eg upgrade card). when you spend a readied defense token, flip it over to its exhausted (red) side. when you spend an exhausted defense token, return it to the supply. all exhausted defense tokens are readied during the status phase. you cannot spend any single defense token more than once per attack, and you cannot spend more than 1 defense token of each type per attack. if your speed is 0, you cannot spend any defense tokens. ship damage suffer each point of damage separately by reducing the shields in the defending hull zone by 1 (rotate the shield dial to the next lowest number). if you do not have any shields remaining, instead draw 1 card from the damage deck and place it facedown near your ship card. if a ship ever has a number of damage cards equal to its hull value, it is destroyed. remove the model and any associated components. a ship or squadron is destroyed if a portion of its base is outside the play area. critical effect before the defender determines the total damage amount from an attack, the attacker can resolve a critical effect. if the attacker rolled at least 1 critical , the first damage card that the defender receives is dealt faceup. the attacker can resolve only 1 critical effect per attack.faceup damage cards count as damage against the ship’s hull and also inflict the effect on the card. they remain faceup until an effect flips them facedown or discards them.attacking squadrons with a ship a ship attacking a squadron can perform 1 attack against each squadron inside the firing arc and at attack range of the attacking hull zone. each attack is resolved separately. squadron attacks squadrons do not declare an attacking hull zone. the attack dice a squadron uses when attacking ships are shown on its squadron card. an attacking squadron can target 1 enemy squadron or ship hull zone at distance 1 using the distance side of the range ruler. squadrons have a firing arc of 360º. they can use all dice colors, but they ignore icons when attacking. squadron defense attacking a squadron follows the same rules for attacking a ship, but the attacker does not declare a defending hull zone. when attacking a squadron, the attacker uses the anti-squadron section of his card to determine his attack dice (this is the same for all hull zones). squadron damage when a squadron suffers damage, reduce its remaining hull points by the damage amount by rotating the squadron’s disk so that the pointer points to the remaining hull points. if a squadron ever has 0 or fewer hull points, it is destroyed. remove the model and any associated components. squadrons suffer damage equal to the number of hits only; they ignore criticals . overlapping squadrons cannot be placed to overlap other ships or squadrons. ships and squadrons can move through other ships and squadrons without issue. if a moving ship’s final position overlaps 1 or more squadrons, the ship finishes its movement normally and any overlapped squadrons are moved out of the way. the player who is not moving the ship places all of the overlapped squadrons, regardless of who owns them, next to the ship so their bases are touching the ship’s base. if a moving ship’s final position would overlap another ship, it cannot finish its movement normally. instead, its speed is temporarily reduced by 1 and it attempts to move at this speed. this process continues until the moving ship can finish a movement or until its speed is temporarily reduced to 0, in which case it remains in its current position. after moving, the moving ship and the closest ship that it overlapped both receive 1 facedown damage card. obstacles ships and squadrons can move through obstacles without issue; only the final position of the ship or squadron matters. if a ship overlaps more than 1 obstacle, resolve the effects in any order. asteroid field a ship that overlaps this obstacle receives 1 faceup damage card. squadrons are unaffected. debris field a ship that overlaps this obstacle suffers 2 damage on any hull zone. squadrons are unaffected.station a ship that overlaps this obstacle may discard 1 of its faceup or facedown damage cards. a squadron that overlaps this obstacle may recover 1 hull point. fleet-building the number in the lower right corner of ship, squadron, or upgrade card is its fleet point cost. you cannot field more than 1 card that has the same unique name (identified by a bullet • to the left of the name). build a standard fleet by choosing any number of ship, squadron, and upgrade cards with a combined fleet point cost not exceeding 300 fleet points, and without any foreknowledge of your opponent’s fleet. squadrons of the same type share a single squadron card. the cost is for 1 squadron of that type. a unique squadron uses its own squadron card instead of the shared card for that type, and you can field only 1 copy of each unique squadron. unique squadrons use the reverse side of the squadron disk of their type (with the portrait on the unique squadron card). fleet restrictions a fleet must be either rebel-aligned or imperial-aligned, and cannot contain any ships, squadrons, or upgrades that are aligned with the opposing faction. a fleet must have 1 and only 1 flagship (a ship equipped with a commander card). assign a flagship id token pair of the appropriate faction to the flagship. a fleet cannot spend more than one third of its fleet points on squadrons. a fleet must include 3 objective cards, one from each category. upgrade cards for each icon shown in on a ship’s upgrade bar at the bottom of its ship card, the ship can equip 1 upgrade card with the matching icon. upgrade cards can be used by ships of any faction unless they have a faction symbol next to the card’s cost. a card with a rebel symbol can only be equipped in a rebel fleet, and one with an imperial symbol can only be equipped in an imperial fleet. a ship cannot equip more than 1 upgrade with the modification trait. a title card can only be equipped to a ship with the matching ship icon. a ship cannot equip more than 1 title card. a ship with a commander card equipped is a flagship. any ship can equip a commander card regardless of the icons on its upgrade bar, but it cannot equip more than one. upgrade card effects may indicate a specific time when they occur. effects that modify attack dice may be resolved after the attack dice are rolled. effects with the icon of a command may resolve while the ship is resolving the matching command. critical effects on upgrade cards are indicated by the : header. the attacker must have at least 1 in his attack pool, and can resolve only 1 critical effect per attack. if a color is specified the icon must be on a die of that color. the standard critical effect is: : if the defender is dealt at least 1 damage card by this attack, deal the first damage card faceup. squadrons cannot resolve or suffer critical effects unless otherwise specified.to exhaust a readied card, rotate it 90° clockwise; while exhausted it cannot be exhausted again. during the status phase, all upgrade cards are readied by rotating them 90° counterclockwise. objectives there are 3 categories of objectives: assault (red), defense (yellow), and navigation (blue). when a ship is chosen as an objective ship, indicate this by placing an objective token next to its ship card. if an objective allows you to collect victory tokens, at the end of the game each victory token is worth the fleet point value listed in the lower right corner of the objective card. winning the game the game immediately ends when all of one player’s ships are destroyed. that player is eliminated, and his opponent wins. if neither player is eliminated after 6 rounds, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. your score is equal to the total cost of each enemy ship (including upgrade card costs) and squadron that was destroyed, plus the fleet point value of any victory tokens you collected. if both players have the same score after 6 rounds, the second player wins the game. optional rules unlimited rounds the game does not end after the sixth round; instead, the game ends only when all of one player’s ships are destroyed. do not use objectives, but place obstacles as normal. in addition, at the end of each round, the player with initiative gives initiative to his opponent by passing the initiative token to that player. team play split the players as equally as possible into 2 teams. each team controls 1 fleet, and must also nominate a team commander from among its members. each player takes exclusive control of 1 or more of his team’s ship and squadron cards and makes all decisions for the corresponding ships and squadrons; including choosing commands, attacking, spending tokens, etc. during the command phase, each player chooses commands for only the ships that he controls. he may discuss his choices with his teammates, but he must do so openly at the table and cannot show his command dials to another player. during the ship phase, the players must agree on which ship to activate when it is their turn to activate a ship. during the squadron phase, the team must agree on which squadrons to activate. if teammates cannot come to an agreement on a choice, the team commander makes the final decision. if all of one player’s ships and squadrons are destroyed, his team continues to play and can win by destroying all of the opposing team’s ships or by having the highest score after 6 rounds."
181,164153,STAR WARS: IMPERIAL ASSAULT,2014,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,3.3039,895,"order of play activation phase play alternates back and forth; in a campaign, starting with the rebel players. when a hero is activated: 1. start of activation: ready all of the hero’s exhausted class and item cards. 2. perform actions: perform any combination of up to 2 of these actions with the hero: move, attack, interact, rest, and special. when a hero is activated, flip his activation token to the red side. if a hero has 2 activation tokens, he cannot resolve his second activation until after each hero has resolved its first activation. in a 3 hero game, the rebel players choose 1 hero to claim a second activation token at the end of each round. the imperial player then chooses 1 deployment card to activate. the number of bars below the card’s deployment cost is the number of figures in its deployment group. perform up to 2 actions with each figure in the group in the order of your choice. resolve both actions for a figure before choosing the next figure. when the last figure from a deployment card is activated, exhaust the card (rotate it 90º). the corresponding figures cannot be activated again during this round. players alternate activating figures in this way until all figures have been activated. each action must be resolved completely before a figure performs its next action. move a figure performing a move gains mps equal to its speed. a figure can move to an orthogonally or diagonally adjacent space by spending 1 mp. mps may be spent before or after performing an action. a hero (only) may suffer 1 strain during his activation to gain 1 mp. he may do this up to twice per activation. a figure can move into a space occupied by a friendly or neutral figure at no additional cost. a figure can move into a space occupied by a hostile figure, but must spend 1 additional mp to do so. a figure cannot end its movement in a space containing another figure. a figure cannot move through the diagonal intersection of walls, blocking terrain, or impassable terrain. walls (black line): spaces separated by a wall are not adjacent. figures cannot move through or trace los through walls. impassable (dotted red line): figures cannot move through dotted red lines. spaces separated by impassable terrain are adjacent. los can be traced through impassable terrain. blocked (red line): figures cannot enter or trace los through blocking terrain. doors (door token): spaces separated by a door are not adjacent. figures cannot move through or trace los through doors. difficult (blue line): a figure must spend 1 additional mp to enter difficult terrain; los can be traced through it.attack 1. declare target: choose an eligible hostile target. each attack is either a melee or a ranged attack . melee attacks can target adjacent figures or objects only. ranged attacks may target adjacent figures or objects. when performing a ranged attack, the target must be in line of sight (los). the attacking player chooses one corner of his figure’s space. trace 2 straight, uninterrupted lines to 2 different corners of the target’s space. these cannot overlap and cannot be traced through walls, blocked terrain, spaces containing figures, or through the diagonal intersection of walls or blocking terrain. 2. roll dice: the attacker rolls the attack dice listed on his deployment card (imperial figures or allies) or weapon item card (heroes). the defender simultaneously rolls the defense dice listed on his deployment card or hero sheet. 3. rerolls: resolve dice reroll effects. each die may be rerolled only once per attack regardless of who rerolls it. 4. apply modifiers: evade each evade icon cancels one result. dodge the attack is a miss. 5. spend surges: surge the attacker can spend to trigger special abilities. a hero may spend up to 1 to recover 1 . 6. check accuracy: on a ranged attack, the accuracy (the sum of the numbers and any modifiers) must be equal to or greater than the number of spaces the target is away from the attacker (the distance). if it is not, the attack is a miss. 7. calculate damage: the target suffers damage equal to the number of icons rolled by the attacker minus the number of block icons rolled by the defender. if the attack is a miss, the target suffers 0 damage.only heroes can use both of their actions to perform attacks during the same activation. if a special action involves one or more attacks, this does count as the figure using an action to attack. interact figures can interact with a token in their space or in an adjacent space. crates: a hero can interact with a crate to draw 1 supply card and place it faceup near his hero sheet. you may use the card’s ability. then claim the crate token by placing it by your hero sheet. a crate token with its colored side down cannot be examined by players. doors: a figure can interact with a door to open it. return the door to the box. figures cannot voluntarily close doors. special: a figure can interact with other tokens on the map, as stated in the mission. if there is an attribute icon listed, the figure must pass the corresponding attribute test to resolve the interact effect. rest only heroes can rest. by resting, a hero can recover equal to his endurance. if a hero recovers in excess of the number of strain tokens he has, he recovers damage equal to the amount of excess. during campaign missions, heroes can suffer strain to resolve some abilities. special class cards, abilities, and mission rules with a allow figures to perform special actions. an ability with requires both of a figure’s actions to resolve. each special action can only be performed once per activation. status phase after all figures have resolved their activations, players ready all exhausted deployment cards (rotate upright) and activation tokens (flip to their green side). abilities abilities provide special effects beyond the standard rules. if the requirements of an ability cannot be met, it cannot be performed. if an ability is ‘used’, it can be triggered multiple times each round, but only once per timing instance. the hero must suffer the listed amount of (without exceeding his endurance) to use the ability. the imperial player must spend the listed amount of threat to use the ability. these abilities are performed as an action and can be performed only once per activation. these abilities can be used by spending results during an attack. the number of the attacker can spend during the attack is equal to the amount of rolled minus the number of evades rolled. each ability can be triggered only once per attack. exhaust: you must exhaust the card to use this ability. deplete: you must deplete the card to use this ability. an ability that can be used ‘during your activation’ can be used before or after performing an action during an activation. it cannot be used while resolving an action. an ability that causes figures to suffer damage is not considered to be an attack. strain and endurance all heroes can choose to suffer to use abilities and to move additional spaces. a hero can only optionally suffer an amount of up to his endurance. if any effect forces a figure to suffer that would exceed its endurance, the figure suffers equal to the amount of excess . damage and defeat damage & strain when you suffer damage or strain , place that number of corresponding tokens on your hero sheet. for other figures, tokens are placed on the map next to the figure. when a figure recovers or , discard the appropriate number of tokens. if a figure suffers outside of an attack, the is not prevented by , and the figure does not roll defense dice. if a hero recovers in excess of the number of strain tokens he has, he recovers equal to the amount of excess . if an object suffers equal to or greater than its health, it is destroyed and removed from the map. incapacitated an incapacitated figure remains on the map and does not restrict movement or block los, though other figures cannot end their movement in the space. the figure discards all conditions, and conditions cannot be applied to it. it cannot suffer or be targeted or affected by anything except as specified by the mission’s rules. however it can still be pushed by a massive figure ending its movement in its space.defeat when a figure has suffered damage equal to its health, it is immediately defeated. excess damage is ignored. when a hero is defeated, he becomes wounded. when any other figure is defeated, it is removed from the map. during a campaign, when the last imperial figure in a non-unique group is defeated, the corresponding deployment card is returned to the imperial player’s hand and can be optionally deployed later in the mission. a hero defeated for the first time during a mission discards all damage tokens from his hero sheet and flips his hero sheet to the wounded side. if there are more strain tokens on your hero sheet than your endurance value, discard the excess tokens. a hero who is wounded follows all rules for activation and can still suffer . if a wounded hero is defeated, he withdraws. a hero who withdraws removes his figure from the map and is eliminated from the mission, but still receives all hero rewards at the end of the mission. attribute tests only heroes roll dice for attribute tests. roll the dice listed for the listed attribute on your hero sheet. if you roll at least 1 , you pass the test. if you roll no , you fail. if a test lists a number directly before the icon, that number of successes are needed in order to pass the test. if you do not roll the required number of successes, you fail the test but place 1 token near the test subject for each success. the next time a figure attempts this test, discard these tokens and apply +1 to your results for each token discarded. an elite figure required to perform an attribute test automatically receives 1 success. a regular figure required to perform a test automatically fails the test. item restrictions heroes can possess an unlimited number of item cards, but each hero can only bring a limited number to an individual mission: 1 armor card 2 weapon cards (any card with an attack type followed by dice icons) 3 equipment cards before deploying, heroes may give any of their item cards, except those from a class or reward deck, to other heroes. item cards cannot be traded during a mission. modifications are items placed below a weapon that provide the listed ability to the weapon. each weapon can have a limited number of modifications (listed as a number of bars in the card’s bottom right corner). an item card cannot have more than 1 modification with the same trait attached to it at the same time, excluding the modification trait. large figures a figure that occupies more than 1 space on the map is a large figure. when a large figure attacks, los may be traced from any single space it occupies. a figure attacking a large figure can target any 1 space the large figure occupies. a large figure cannot move diagonally. while moving, a large figure cannot rotate its base unless it spends 1 mp; and when doing so must occupy at least half of the spaces it occupied before the rotation.keywords blast if the target of this attack suffers 1 or more , each figure and object adjacent to the target space suffers equal to the blast value (not prevented by ). if the target is a large figure, blast only affects figures adjacent to the targeted space and does not affect the target figure. if an attack inflicts a condition, it is applied only to the target of the attack and not to figures affected by blast. cleave if the target of this attack suffers one or more , the attacker may choose a different hostile eligible figure or object to suffer the listed (not prevented by ). if an attack inflicts a condition, it is applied only to the target of the attack and not to figures affected by cleave. massive figures do not block los to or from a massive figure. during a campaign, massive figures cannot enter interior spaces. they can move through and end their movement on spaces with blocking and impassable terrain or other figures (not massive figures), and can enter spaces containing hostile figures and difficult terrain at no additional mp cost. any figures in a massive figure’s spaces are pushed into the closest empty space of its controller’s choice. the player moving the massive figure pushes friendly figures first, and then other players push their figures. after a massive figure ends its movement in spaces containing at least 1 other figure, it cannot move any more during this activation. if a massive figure occupies a space containing blocking terrain, los can be traced to that figure, spaces can be counted to it, and adjacent figures can attack it. mobile this figure ignores additional movement costs when entering difficult terrain and spaces containing hostile figures. it can also enter, move through and end its movement in impassable spaces and edges and blocking terrain. if it is in blocking terrain, los can be traced to the figure and adjacent figures can attack it. pierce this figure may ignore a number of results while attacking. if the number of results is less than the pierce value, the excess has no effect. if multiple pierce abilities are used in an attack, their values are added together. reach the figure may perform melee attacks targeting figures or objects up to 2 spaces away and in los. a reach attack does not require accuracy. conditions when a hero gains a condition, he places the appropriate condition card by his hero sheet; place an appropriate condition token next to other figures. a figure cannot be affected by multiple instances of the same condition. if a keyword causes a condition, the target of the attack must suffer 1 or more to trigger the condition (which is applied after the attack resolves). a beneficial condition is applied to the attacker and a harmful condition is applied to the target. focus the figure receives an additional green die the next time it attacks or performs a test. the condition is then discarded.a figure with the focus keyword may become focused after attacking if the target suffers 1 or more . other rules retrieving tokens to retrieve a token, a figure must perform an interact while on or adjacent to the token. then place the token on the figure’s base to denote the figure is carrying it. if the figure is defeated, the token is dropped in the figure’s space and can be retrieved as above. figures cannot optionally drop tokens they are carrying. controlling tokens and spaces to control a token or space, there must be a friendly figure on or adjacent to the token or space and no hostile figures on or adjacent to the token or space. timing when an ability interrupts another figure’s activation, the current activation pauses while the interrupting ability is resolved, then the activation resumes. a figure’s action cannot be interrupted while the figure is in a space containing another figure. while attacking, resolve mission rules first, then attacker effects, then defender effects. in a campaign, resolve mission rules first (imperial player decides the order if several resolve at the same time), then imperial player effects, then rebel player effects. in a skirmish, resolve mission rules first (the player with initiative decides the order if several resolve at the same time), then effects from the player with initiative, then effects from his opponent. depleted cards when a card is depleted, it is flipped facedown and cannot be used for the remainder of the mission. at the end of each mission, all depleted cards are flipped faceup. exhaust cards are rotated 90º to mark that they are exhausted; activation tokens are flipped red side up. if all deployment cards or activation tokens belonging to a player are exhausted, he cannot use abilities that must be used before, during, or after his figure activates. initial groups when the last figure in an initial group is defeated, the corresponding deployment card is placed in the imperial player’s hand. he can deploy these figures during optional deployments following normal deployment rules. neutral figures no player controls a neutral figure, and they cannot activate or perform actions. they cannot suffer or be targeted by attacks, abilities, or any game effect except as specified by the mission’s rules. neutral figures block los. figures can move through spaces containing neutral figures at no additional mp cost. push the player resolving this ability moves the figure the specified number of spaces in any direction. when pushing a large figure, it cannot move diagonally and cannot be rotated. if a non-ability effect pushes a figure, such as a mission rule or if a door closes between 2 spaces occupied by a large figure, the player controlling that figure determines its placement. control a player controls a deployment zone if there is at least 1 friendly figure in any space of that deployment zone and no hostile figures in any space of that zone. class cards if a hero has a class deck that includes item cards with an xp cost, these can be purchased with xp like any other class card and sold for 50 credits like any other item card without a listed credit cost."

faction sheet, mission cards, and action cards. each player takes his 4 starting leaders (no recruit icon) and places them in the leader pool box on his faction sheet. place all leaders with recruit icons near the board. assemble the board and place the time marker on space 1 of the track and the reputation marker on space 14. sort the objective cards into 3 piles (i, ii, and iii), and shuffle each pile individually. create the objective deck by placing pile iii on the objectives space on the board; then pile ii on the top of pile iii, then pile i on top of pile ii. the rebel player draws 1 card from the objective deck, keeping it secret from the imperial player. each player takes all of their action cards with a recruit icon and shuffles them to create their action deck. place your deck facedown next to the action deck side of your faction sheet. shuffle the space tactic and ground tactic decks individually and place them with all remaining markers and dice near the board. each player sets aside their 4 starting mission cards (curved arrow at the bottom). the imperial player shuffles the project mission cards (white star) and places them on the project space on the board. each player shuffles their remaining mission cards to create their mission deck, and places it facedown next to the mission deck side of their faction sheet. shuffle the probe deck and draw cards from the top of the deck until 3 rebel systems and 5 imperial systems have been revealed. place a rebel loyalty marker in each of the 3 rebel systems. place a subjugation marker in the first 2 imperial systems drawn and an imperial loyalty marker in each of the other 3 imperial systems drawn. return the 5 imperial probe cards to the box and shuffle all other probe cards back into the probe deck. the imperial player takes 3 star destroyers, 3 assault carriers, 12 tie fighters, 12 stormtroopers, 5 at-sts , 1 at-at , and 1 death star. these units can be placed in any system that has an imperial loyalty marker or subjugation marker. at least 1 ground unit must be placed in each imperial system. the rebel player receives 1 corellian corvette, 1 rebel transport, 2 x-wings, 2 y-wings, 6 rebel troopers, and 2 airspeeders. these units can be placed in the rebel base space of the board and/or in any one rebel or neutral system. each faction draws 2 random starting action cards (no recruit icon) and places them facedown near his faction sheet. players can look at their own action cards at any time. the rebel player ensures that all systems that contain imperial units have been removed from the probe deck. then, from the remaining probe cards, he secretly chooses 1 card and places it facedown under the rebel base location space on the board. then shuffle the probe deck and place it on the probe deck space. each player takes his 4 starting missions and draws 2 cards from his mission deck to create his starting hand. keep this hand of cards secret from your opponent.systems and regions the game board has 8 regions, separated from each other by orange borders. each region contains 4 systems. each of the 32 systems on the board consists of planet art, the system’s name, a space area around the planet, and the system’s borders. ground units in the system are placed on the planet, and ships are placed in the space area. populous systems have a loyalty space and at least 1 resource icon. systems without a loyalty space or resource icons are remote systems. destroyed systems are no longer populous or remote. game round 1. assignment phase the rebel player assigns any of his leaders to missions, followed by the imperial player. to assign a leader to a mission, take a mission card from your hand and place it facedown near your faction sheet. then choose 1 or 2 leaders from your leader pool and place them on top of the card. if leaders assigned to a mission by a player or an ability do not have a combined number of matching skill icons equal to or exceeding the mission’s skill requirement (top left hand corner), the mission cannot be revealed and remains facedown in the command phase. any leaders not assigned to missions stay in the leader pool and can be used during the command phase to move units or oppose enemy missions. 2. command phase starting with the rebel player, players alternate taking turns activating a system or revealing a mission. you can pass at any time. after passing, you cannot use your leaders to activate systems or reveal missions for the rest of the phase (you can still oppose missions or add them to combat). after all players have passed, proceed to the refresh phase. a. activ ate a system move your units and initiate combat by activating a system with a leader. take a leader from your leader pool and place it anywhere in a system to activate it. a leader without tactic values cannot activate a system. a system that already contains a leader can be activated. you cannot move units out of a system that already contains one of your leaders. a leader in the rebel base space prevents units from being moved out of the rebel base space, but not from moving units that are in the rebel base’s system. when a system is activated, you can move your units from adjacent systems to the activated system. each incoming ship can bring a number of ground units along with it equal to its transport capacity. tie fighters also require transport as if they were ground units. units with the transport restriction icon can only move when you are moving units with transport capacity out of the same system. a unit with the immobile icon cannot move.units can move over orange region borders, but not through light red impassible areas. if an ability allows you to move units, you must follow all movement rules and restrictions. if an imperial ground unit moves into in a system that does not have imperial loyalty, place a subjugation marker there. if an imperial ground unit moves into a system, the rebel player must declare whether the rebel base is in that system and reveal the base before resolving a combat. after moving units into a system that contains opposing units, players resolve a combat. b. reveal a mission choose a facedown mission card that one of your leaders is assigned to, flip it faceup and read it aloud. choose where you are resolving the mission and place the leaders assigned to the mission in that system. if a mission is attempted against a leader, it is attempted in that leader’s system. if a mission is attempted or resolved in the rebel base space, place the leader in the rebel base space of the board, not in the system where the rebel base is hidden. resolve means that the mission card’s ability automatically occurs and cannot be opposed. attempt means that the mission card’s ability is only performed if the mission succeeds. the mission will automatically succeed unless it is opposed by an opponent’s leader. after using a starting mission card, return it to your hand. all other mission cards are discarded after use. if a leader on a mission card is eliminated, captured, or moved off the mission, the mission card returns to its owner’s hand without being revealed. opposing a mission after you declare where you are attempting a mission, your opponent may place 1 leader from his leader pool in the system where the mission is being attempted to oppose that mission (even if he already has leaders in the system). if both players have a leader there, the mission is opposed. starting with the current player, each player rolls dice (of any color) equal to the combined number of skill icons on all of his leaders in the system that match the mission’s skill requirement. each player can roll a maximum of 10 dice total. each and rolled is 1 success. each rolled is 2 successes. if the player attempting the mission rolls more successes than his opponent, the mission succeeds and he performs the ability on the mission card. if he rolls equal to or fewer successes than his opponent, the mission fails and he does not perform the ability. if the mission card has a leader portrait in the top left corner, its owner gains 2 additional successes if one of the leaders assigned to this mission matches this portrait. if your opponent has a leader in the system but no matching skill icons, you must still roll dice and need at least 1 success to succeed at the mission.3. refresh phase 1. retrieve leaders the rebel player can play 1 start of refresh phase objective card.each player then returns all of his leaders from the board to his leader pool. if a leader is still on a mission card, it returns to the leader pool and the card returns to the player’s hand. 2. draw missions each player draws 2 mission cards, discard cards if you are holding more than 10. starting missions cannot be discarded. 3. launch probe droids the imperial player draws 2 probe cards. each shows 1 system where the rebel base is not located. keep these cards secret. 4. draw objective the rebel player draws 1 objective card. 5. advance time marker advance the time marker 1 space along the track. players then recruit and/or build if these icons are in the marker’s new space: i. recruit: each player simultaneously draws 2 cards from his action deck. the rebel player chooses 1 leader shown on either card, and places that leader in his leader pool, then the imperial player does the same. keep your chosen action card facedown (you can use it at a later time) and place the unchosen action card on the bottom of your action deck without revealing it. you cannot recruit a leader that is already on the board, in a leader pool, or eliminated from the game. if all of the leaders on the drawn cards have already been recruited, you may continue drawing cards one at a time until you draws one that shows a leader you have not already recruited. you can choose a card even if you cannot recruit any of the leaders on it (you gain the card but do not recruit a new leader). ii. build: players simultaneously build 1 unit for each resource icon in their loyal and subjugated systems. you cannot use a system’s resource icons to build units if your opponent has a unit in the system. for subjugated systems, use only the left-most resource icon. the rebel player can also use the resource icons in the rebel base, unless the base is revealed and the imperial player has a unit or loyalty in the system. take the units from your supply and place them on your build queue in the space matching the number to the left of the resource icon. you may destroy a unit on the board if you have none of that type available in your supply and you are placing the unit on your build queue. 6. deploy units starting with the rebel player, each player slides all units 1 space down his build queue towards his edge of the board. any of your units that slide from the 1 space off the board may be deployed in systems that have your loyalty or subjugation markers. each player can deploy a maximum of 2 units in each system. if you cannot (or don’t want to) deploy some of your units, place them back on the 1 space of your build queue. if it is hidden, the rebel player may build units from, and deploy units in, the rebel base space as if it were a system. you cannot deploy units to remote systems, or systems that contain an opponent’s ships or ground units or a sabotage marker.skills diplomacy: missions that provide loyalty in systems or give players more units. intel: rebel intel missions help acquire objective cards. imperial intel missions help locate the rebel base. spec ops: rebel spec ops missions destroy imperial units. imperial spec ops missions capture and exploit rebel leaders. logistics: rebel logistics missions move units to and from the rebel base. imperial logistics missions build special units or accelerate imperial units’ build time. objective cards the rebel player may play an objective card from his hand if he fulfills the card’s requirement at the specified time. gain the reputation shown in the card’s top-left corner by moving the reputation marker that number of spaces toward the time marker, then discard the card to the box (it cannot be used again this game). the rebel player can have any number of objective cards in his hand. only 1 objective can be played during each combat and each refresh phase. the project deck contains mission cards that the imperial player can draw by resolving his research and development mission. when a project card is discarded, it is placed in the project deck discard pile. action cards each action card can be used once per game. use an action card by flipping it faceup, resolving its ability, and discarding it to the box. if 2 players wish to use action cards at the same time, the current player resolves his card first. if an action card ability lets a player search for a specific mission card, do not reveal the mission card to your opponent. action cards used during a mission or combat can only be used if one of the leaders shown on the card is already in the system. a card specifies when it can be used: assignment: the card is used during the assignment phase. instead of assigning a leader to a mission, a player flips the card faceup and resolves its ability. start of combat: the card is used immediately after the add leader step of the combat currently being resolved. immediate: the card must be used as soon as the player gains the card, either during setup or after choosing it when recruiting a leader. the card is immediately revealed and resolved. special: the card is used when specified. players can gain additional action cards during the advance time marker step of the refresh phase. when you recruit a leader during this phase, place the chosen action card facedown near your faction sheet, and place the unchosen action card facedown at the bottom of your action deck. loy alty and subjugation loyalty a system’s current loyalty (rebel, imperial, or neutral) is indicated by the loyalty marker in the system. if a system does not have a loyalty marker, it is neutral. remote systems are always neutral. players usually gain loyalty in systems by resolving diplomacy () missions. the player who has loyalty in a system can use the system’s resources to build new units.when you gain 1 loyalty in a system that is neutral, place your loyalty marker in that system; the system is now loyal to your faction. when you gain 1 loyalty in a system that is loyal to the other player, remove that loyalty marker from the system; it is now neutral. if an ability requires you to have loyalty in a system, you must have a loyalty marker there. it doesn’t matter if your opponent has units or a subjugation marker in the system. a system that has an imperial loyalty marker or subjugation marker is an imperial system. coruscant is always loyal to the imperial player and cannot gain or lose loyalty. a system that has a rebel loyalty marker and no subjugation marker in it is a rebel system. the rebel base space is not a system and cannot gain or lose loyalty. subjugation when there is at least 1 imperial ground unit in a system that does not have imperial loyalty, the system becomes subjugated. place a subjugation marker in its loyalty space. if the system had rebel loyalty, place the marker on top of the rebel loyalty marker. a system with a subjugation marker is an imperial system, but the marker does not define the system’s loyalty. if at any time there are no imperial ground units in a subjugated system, the subjugation marker is removed and the system’s loyalty returns to the rebels (or returns to neutral if no loyalty marker is beneath it). if a neutral subjugated system gains imperial loyalty, flip its subjugation marker to the loyalty side. if a subjugated system gains rebel loyalty, place a rebel loyalty marker beneath the subjugation marker. the imperial player can deploy units to a subjugated system, and build new units using its left-most resource icon. the rebel player cannot build or deploy units in a subjugated system, even if a rebel loyalty marker is under the subjugation marker. leaders capturing leaders some abilities cause a rebel leader to become captured: attach the captured leader ring to that leader. captured leaders do not oppose missions; cannot return to the leader pool; cannot use action cards; do not contribute their tactic values during a combat; and cannot be moved by the rebel player. however, they do not prevent rebel units from moving out of their system. captured leaders can be moved by the imperial player like ground units (they do not count toward transport capacity). they cannot be moved when retreating. if a mission is attempted against a captured leader, that leader opposes the mission and rolls dice even though it is captured. the rebel player can also send another leader from his leader pool to oppose the mission as normal. the imperial player has only 1 captured leader ring. if he captures a second leader, the first leader is rescued, and he attaches the captured leader ring to the new leader. however, the imperial player can capture an additional leader in carbonite. a leader in carbonite is a captured leader and can be rescued and targeted by any card that affects captured leaders. rescuing captured leaders when a captured leader is rescued, remove the ring from the leader and place the leader in the rebel base space. if there are no imperial units in a captured leader’s system, that leader is immediately rescued. some mission cards can also rescue captured leaders.attachment rings some card abilities attach rings onto leaders. when a card ability attaches a ring to a leader, keep the card as a reminder of the ring’s ability. if a leader with a ring receives another, the previous ring is removed to make room for the new one. eliminating leaders when a leader is eliminated, return it to the box. it cannot be used for the rest of the game. luke skywalker treat luke skywalker (jedi) as luke skywalker for all card abilities and action card restrictions. sabotage markers a sabotage marker in a system means that neither player can use its resource icons to build new units, and units cannot be deployed there. a maximum of 1 sabotage marker can be in each system. if an ability is resolved in a system that allows a player to place units on the build queue, it can be performed even if there is a sabotage marker in the system. ships and units ships all units with blue resource icons are ships. super star destroyers, the death star, and the death star under construction (dsuc) are also ships. a ship with a red health value is a capital ship. a ship that has a black health value is a fighter. structures the shield generator and ion cannon are special ground units called structures. they are immobile and instead of providing dice in combat they have special abilities. the death star the death star and death star under construction are space stations, not capital ships, fighters, or structures. the dsuc is immobile. if an ability allows the imperial player to deploy a death star in a system, it can only be placed in the dsuc’s system. if a dsuc is destroyed, the death star on the build queue is also destroyed. the death star does not have a health value and cannot be assigned or dealt damage. it can only be destroyed by the death star plans objective card (this card can also be used to destroy a dsuc). the rebel player can use only one of these objective cards each combat round. the superlaser online mission card can destroy a system. place a destroyed system marker in the system and destroy all rebel ground units there. the imperial player must destroy a number of their units that require transport that exceed the transport capacity of imperial ships in the system. ground units can move into destroyed systems, but ground battles cannot occur there; space battles are resolved as normal. destroyed systems do not have loyalty and cannot be subjugated. if the death star destroys the system where the rebel base is located, the imperial player immediately wins the game. the rebel base while the rebel base is hidden, the rebel player can deploy units in the rebel base space on the board without revealing the system in which his base is located. an effect referring to the rebel base space is referring to that board space and not the system where the rebel base is hidden. the rebel base space is not a system.moving to and from the rebel base while the rebel base is hidden, rebel units can move from the rebel base space to either the base’s system or systems adjacent to it. a leader in the rebel base space prevents moving units from the space. a few missions allow rebel units to move between the base and any system ignoring adjacency. revealing the rebel base if the imperial player ever has loyalty or ground units in the rebel base’s system, the base is immediately revealed. when imperial ground units enter the system, the base is revealed before resolving a combat. the rebel player may optionally reveal his base at the start of one of his turns in the command phase, before using one of his leaders. when the base is revealed, the rebel player flips the probe card under the location space faceup and places it in the rebel base space. all units and leaders in the rebel base space are placed in the system shown on the probe card. keep it faceup on the rebel base space to remind players that the base is revealed. while the base is revealed, the resource icons in the rebel base space can still be used (unless there is an imperial unit or imperial loyalty in the rebel base’s system). however units cannot be deployed in, or moved to, the rebel base space. any leaders or units that would be placed (not deployed) here are instead placed in the system shown on the faceup probe card. any cards that apply to the rebel base space apply to the base’s system instead. the imperial long range probe mission card does not reveal the rebel base. establishing a new base the rapid mobilization mission card allows the rebel player to establish a new base. he draws the top 4 cards from the probe deck and may choose one of them to become the new base location. he cannot choose a system that has imperial loyalty, imperial units, or a destroyed system marker. if he chooses a new base location, he reveals the old base’s probe card and moves all units and leaders from the rebel base space to the old base’s system. the rebel player will not have any units at the new base until he either moves units to it or deploys units there. he gives the old base’s probe card to the imperial player and places the new base’s probe card facedown under the location space. then he shuffles all unchosen probe cards and places them facedown on the bottom of the probe deck. if the rebel player chooses not to establish a new base, all drawn probe cards are shuffled and placed on the bottom of the probe deck. winning the game the imperial player immediately wins the game if if there are imperial units in the rebel base’s system and there are no rebel units in the system. the rebel base must be revealed. the imperial player immediately wins the game if the death star destroys the system where the rebel base is located. the rebel player immediately wins the game if the reputation marker and time marker are in the same space of the time track.

hand of 6 cards and plays 2 from their hand; at the end of the round, each player draws 2 cards from the team’s deck. play passes clockwise from the left-most rebel player, as follows: rebel 1, empire 1, empire 2, rebel 2. teammates may consult with each other, but all moving and rolling is done by the player who played the card. when choosing cards, teammates may show each other cards and discuss strategies, but not exchange cards. game round 1. plan assault each player simultaneously chooses 3 cards from their hand and places them facedown as their order pile. the top card is your first order, the middle card your second, and the bottom card your third. you must always choose 3 cards, even if not all orders can be used. set the remaining 3 cards in your hand aside, facedown, until the end of the round. 2. take turns giving orders the rebel player goes first each round. on your turn, flip the top card of your order pile and choose one of the orders on the card to play. players alternate flipping over cards and giving orders until no one has cards left in their order pile. this marks the end of the round. if you earn bonus order cards during the round, draw them from the top of your deck and place them, without looking or rearranging, at the bottom of your order pile, to be played at the end of the round. if you still have cards when your opponent’s order pile runs out, you can give back-to-back orders. place played cards faceup in a discard pile. if your order deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile to create a new draw deck. 3. draw 3 cards each player

sectors either occupied by your other ships or clear (no ships of any type in them). ships selected to move during a move order must all move into the same adjacent sector. ships cannot move into or through a sector that contains enemy ships, and no ship may move through or occupy the death star sector. any number of fighters can occupy a sector, and each sector may contain any combination of a player’s fighters and special ships. empire orders tie fighters you may deploy 4 new tie fighters to the sector the executor is in or move any number of tie fighters from one sector to an adjacent one. after deploying, moving (or choosing not to move) a squad of tie fighters, you may attack an adjacent sector by rolling 1 die for each tie fighter (up to 5 dice). executor you may move the executor up to 2 adjacent sectors. after moving (or choosing not to move) the executor, you may attack an adjacent sector by rolling 4 dice. death star choose a faceup rebel fleet marker (with fighters or not) and roll 2 dice. as long as one die is a 5 or 6, destroy that marker (flip it over) and all the fighters on it. if no rebel fleet markers are faceup, you may choose to target any sector and, if successful, destroy all ships on it (including the millenium falcon). rebel orders x-wings you may move any number of x-wings from one sector to an adjacent one. after moving (or choosing not to move) a squad of x-wings, you may attack an adjacent sector by rolling 1 die for each x-wing (up to 5 dice). y-wings you may move any number of y-wings from one sector to an adjacent one. after moving (or choosing not to move) a squad of y-wings, you may attack an adjacent sector by rolling 1 die for each y-wing (up to 5 dice). b-wings you may move any number of b-wings from one sector to an adjacent one. after moving (or choosing not to move) a squad of b-wings, you may attack an adjacent sector by rolling 1 die for each b-wing (up to 5 dice). millenium falcon you may move the millenium falcon up to 2 adjacent sectors. after moving (or choosing not to move) the millenium falcon, you may attack an adjacent sector by rolling 2 dice.attacking you may attack ships (even those on a rebel fleet marker) in an adjacent sector, either after moving ships, or without moving any ships. all ships of the selected type can join in the attack (even those that did not move this turn). the maximum dice you can roll in a single attack is 5. to attack with fighter ships (tie fighters, x-wings, y-wings, b-wings), roll 1 die for each fighter in the sector from which you are attacking. to attack with the millenium falcon, roll 2 dice.to attack with the executor, roll 4 dice. the rebel player can attack the death star from an adjacent sector once the shield generator is destroyed. if one die rolled is a 6, the death star is destroyed and the rebel player wins. roll all your attack dice at once. each result can be applied to one ship (the attacker decides). different ships require the following numbers to take a hit: rebel ships imperial ships millenium falcon: 5+ executor: 5+ rebel fleet markers: 5+ tie fighters: 3+ b-wings: 5+ death star (once y-wings: 4+ the shield generator x-wings: 3+ is destroyed): 6 when a fighter or a rebel fleet marker is hit, it is immediately destroyed. any fighters on a rebel fleet marker are destroyed when the marker is destroyed (flip the marker over). when a special ship (the millenium falcon or the executor) is hit, move its hit token down 1 space for each hit. if the token reaches the last space, that special ship is destroyed. if the executor is destroyed, all the tie fighters not yet in play are destroyed. destroyed ships are permanently removed from the game. destroyed tie fighters cannot be deployed. bonus orders if an attack clears a sector (including destroying a rebel fleet marker), the attacking player immediately draws 1 bonus order card. if the millenium falcon is destroyed, the empire player immediately draws 2 bonus order cards. this is in addition to any card received for clearing a sector. the shield assault to attack the death star, the rebels must first destroy the shield generator by reaching the end of the shield assault track on endor. empire order shield ambush place 3 stormtroopers on the 3 spaces directly in front of the rebel strike team token, increasing the

be given. rebel order shield assault roll all 5 dice. each space on the shield assault track has a number on it: this is the minimum you must roll to move onto that space. you can advance the rebel strike team token by using a die whose number is equal to or higher than the number on the track. each die used advances the token 1 space. if there is a stormtrooper on the track, that space’s number is 1 higher than listed. when the token is moved onto that space, that stormtrooper is removed from the track; the empire may use it on future turns. the battle between luke skywalker and darth vader when skywalker or vader’s token reaches the end of his track, that character is destroyed. empire orders darth vader roll 4 dice. any roll of 4, 5, or 6 deals 1 hit to skywalker, for a maximum of 4 hits. this order cannot be given if vader has been defeated. emperor immediately deal 2 hits to skywalker. this order cannot be given if vader has been redeemed. rebel orders luke skywalker roll 4 dice. any roll of 4, 5, or 6 deals 1 hit to vader, for a maximum of 4 hits. this order cannot be given if luke has been defeated. darth vader redeemed this order can only be given if vader’s hit token is on a red highlighted spot (3,2, or 1 hit remaining) and luke is still alive. both vader and the emperor are destroyed. bonus orders if skywalker is destroyed the empire player immediately draws 4 bonus order cards. if vader is destroyed the rebel player immediately draws 3 bonus order cards. if both the emperor and vader are destroyed the rebel player immediately draws 5 bonus order cards.

184,103886,STAR WARS: THE CARD GAME,2013,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,2.9675,277,"setup one player fights for the light side of the force (ls) and the other the dark side of the force (ds). each side recruits its allies from 3 different affiliations: the rebel alliance, smugglers and spies, and jedi (ls), and the imperial navy, scum and villainy, and sith (ds). non-affiliated cards are neutral. a player’s deck is constructed from objective sets, each made up of 6 cards: one objective card and 5 others (unit, event, fate, or enhancement cards). each player takes his side’s 3 force cards and his constructed deck, then places his affiliation card before him (this card is always in play and may be referenced by card abilities). place the balance of the force token in the game area with its light side faceup. all focus, damage, and shield tokens form the token pool. remove all objective cards from your deck and shuffle them facedown into a separate objective deck. your remaining cards form your command deck. if you are instructed to draw cards you do so from your command deck, and any reference to your deck means this deck, unless stated otherwise. the ds player sets the death star dial to 0. secretly look at the top 4 cards of your objective deck, select 3, and place the fourth facedown at the bottom of the deck. then place your 3 chosen objective cards facedown in your play area. shuffles your command deck and draw the top 6 cards to create your starting hand. if players agree, you may shuffle your cards back into your deck and draw a new starting hand (“taking a mulligan”), which you must keep. the ds player puts his 3 chosen objective cards into play one at a time by flipping them faceup in the order of his choosing, resolving any relevant interrupt or reaction card effects on one card before putting the next into play. then the ls player does the same with his 3 chosen objective cards. the 3 objective cards faceup in your play area are your current objective cards. any text on a card or in the rules that uses the word “cannot” is absolute and cannot be countermanded by another effect. otherwise, when text on a card directly contradicts the text in the rules, the card takes precedence. focus you may focus one of your cards—to perform an ability or take some other action—by placing a focus token on it. a card without focus tokens is ready; one with one or more focus tokens is exhausted. you cannot focus an exhausted card. if card abilities or game rules require focus tokens to be placed on a card, this does not cause the card to focus, but it does cause it to become exhausted. discarding means removing a card from your hand, deck, or play area and placing it faceup on the top of your command deck discard pile. if multiple cards are discarded simultaneously, choose the order in which they are placed in the discard pile. a discarded force card is returned to your supply of available force cards. discarded or removed tokens are returned to the token pool.the game round the ds player always takes the first turn of the game. players take alternating turns. 1. balance phase the ds player is the active player: advance the death star dial by 1 point. if the balance of the force token is dark side faceup, advance it 1 additional point. the ls player is the active player: if the balance of the force token is light side faceup, you may deal 1 damage to any one ds current objective. if this destroys the objective card, places it in your victory pile. 2. refresh phase 1. remove 1 focus token from each card in your play area. during his first turn only, the ls player skips this step. 2. remove all shield tokens from each card in your play area. 3. if you have fewer than 3 current objective cards, replace each missing card with a card from your objective deck. if a card just put into play has a “when this card enters play ...” (or similar) effect, immediately resolve it. any effect with the text “after you refresh” can now be used. 3. draw phase you may choose 1 card in your hand and discard it. then you must return your hand to a number of cards equal to your current reserve value, drawing from your deck or choosing and discarding from your hand as necessary. at the start of the game, each player’s reserve value is 6. 4. deployment phase you may play as many unit and enhancement cards from your hand as you can afford. a card played must be paid for by paying its resource cost, or if cannot be played. each time you play a unit or enhancement card, it is an action. each action must be fully resolved before the next can begin. when a card enters play, it is immediately eligible to perform any permitted game function that same turn. unit cards are always played faceup into your play area. enhancement cards usually enhance unit cards, but other game elements can be enhanced (see the card’s text). an enhancement card with the text “enhance [card type],” is placed partially beneath a card in play of the specified type, keeping the enhancement card is visible; the enhancement card is now attached to that card. when a card leaves play, any enhancements attached to it are immediately discarded to their owner’s discard pile. there is no limit to the number of enhancements that can be attached to a card or game element. an enhancement that enhances a play area is placed faceup in the specified player’s play area. an enhancement instructing its player to enhance something not in play cannot be played. 5. conflict phase you may engage one or more of the enemy’s current objective cards, one at a time. during his first turn, the ds player skips this entire phase.you may decide to not engage and instead proceed directly to the force phase.each engagement is declared and resolved one at a time, and each current enemy objective card may only be engaged once per turn. after each engagement, you may engage another current enemy objective card. if you don’t, or if you’ve already engaged each current enemy objective card, this phase ends. 6. force phase 1. force commitment you may commit any unit cards in your play area to the force (except for a unit card already committed to the force). to commit a unit, take one of your available force cards and place it underneath the unit card. when a unit committed to the force leaves play, the attached force card is returned to its owner’s supply of available force cards. force cards are not considered “cards” and are never “in play.” they only identify which units are committed to the force. after you have attached all of your 3 force cards to your units, you cannot commit additional units to the force until one or more of your force cards become available. you are strictly limited to 3 force cards. after a unit is committed to the force, it is able to participate in a force struggle. when the unit is focused to strike during an engagement (as an attacker or a defender), it receives 2 focus tokens instead of one. a unit committed to the force remains committed as long as it is in play; you may not voluntarily remove force cards from your units. 2. force struggle each player now adds the number of force icons on his ready units that are committed to the force to find his force total. the player with the highest force total flips the balance of the force token so that his side of the force is faceup. on a tie, the token remains as it is. force icons on enhancements are not counted towards a player’s force total, even if an enhancement is attached to a unit that is committed to the force. count only the force icons on the unit card itself. after you complete your force phase, your turn is over, and your opponent begins a new turn. while playing the game, the balance of the force is with the side that is currently faceup on the balance of the force token. winning the game the ls player wins the game immediately when: - 3 or more ds objective cards are destroyed. - the ds player must draw a card from his command deck or objective deck, but that deck is empty. the ds player wins the game immediately when: - the death star dial advances to 12. - the ls player must draw a card from his command deck or objective deck, but that deck is empty. resources when you wish to play a card or are required to spend resources to execute an ability, reveal the card or ability to your opponent, then generate the required number of resources from one or more ready, resource-providing cards in your play area to pay the resource cost (upper left corner). your affiliation card, objective cards, and some unit and enhancement cards have a resource value (the number inside the card’s resource icon) and can generate resources.generate resources by placing focus tokens on the card up to its resource value (one resource for each focus token placed). you may generate resources from multiple ready and resource- providing cards in your play area. cards with focus tokens are exhausted; you may not generate resources from an exhausted card. after generating sufficient resources, play the card you revealed or execute the ability you designated. the generated resources cannot pay for multiple cards or abilities. any resources generated in excess of the resource cost are lost. if you cannot generate enough resources to pay the cost, the card cannot be played (it returns to your hand) nor the ability executed. when playing a card from your hand, at least one of the cards used to generate the resources must match the affiliation of the card being played. this is called a resource match. neutral cards, or cards with a resource cost of 0, do not require a resource match. neutral resource-providing cards do not qualify as a resource match for any affiliation. resolving an engagement when the active player engages an enemy objective card, resolve the following engagement steps: 1. declare objective declare which one of your enemy’s current objective cards you will engage. each enemy objective may be engaged only once per conflict phase. if you have already engaged all of your enemy’s current objectives this phase, you must proceed to the force phase. 2. declare attackers declare which of your ready units will engage. push these attackers towards the middle of the table. at least one unit must be declared as an attacker, or you cannot initiate an engagement. 3. declare defenders the defending player declares which of his ready units will engage. push these defenders towards the middle of the table. the defending player has the option to declare no defenders. any unit card that has been declared as either an attacker or a defender during an engagement is participating in the engagement until it is removed from the engagement, leaves play, or all steps of the engagement are complete. 4. fight edge battle the winner of the edge battle makes the first strike during the resolve strikes step of the engagement, and is able to use the white-framed edge-enabled combat icons on his striking units. you must control at least one participating unit to place cards in the edge battle. if the defending player controls no defending units, the attacking player automatically wins the edge battle (although he may still place cards into the edge battle if he wishes). 1. place edge cards the attacker may place one card facedown from his hand in front of him, forming his edge stack; or he may pass. the defender then has the same options. players alternate, each placing one card facedown into his edge stack or passing, until both consecutively pass. you may place any card from your hand into your edge stack, ignoring its cost or affiliation. fate cards can only be placed into an edge stack; they have no other function.2. reveal edge stacks both edge stacks are simultaneously revealed. except for fate cards and all force icons, the cards placed in an edge stack are considered blank cards (cards with no attributes, costs, effects, text, or affiliation). 3. resolve fate cards in ascending order (lowest to highest) of priority number, each player resolves the effects of fate cards in his edge stack. if the priority number of two or more fate cards are equal, the attacker decides the order in which they are resolved. the effect of each fate card must be fully resolved before the resolution of the next fate card begins. 4. finishing the edge battle each player counts the number of force icons on cards in his edge stack. the player with the higher total wins the edge battle and has the edge for the remainder of the engagement. on a tie, the edge goes to the defender. each player then discards the cards he placed into his edge stack. 5. resolve strikes starting with the player with the edge, each player in turn focuses one of his participating ready units to strike. resolve each strike fully before the next strike begins. then his opponent focuses one of his ready participating units to strike. players alternate, focusing a unit and resolving its strike, until no participating ready unit remains. you may not pass during this step; if you have at least one ready participating unit, it must focus to strike. if all of your participating ready units are exhausted, but your opponent’s are not, the opponent continues to focus and strike with his ready participating units, resolving one strike at a time, until all participating units are exhausted. resolving a strike 1. choose one of your participating ready units. 2. focus the unit to strike (place a focus token on the card). 3. resolve the striking unit’s combat icons by type, in an order of your choice. the number of icons of a type is the card’s icon strength of that icon type. unit damage: chooses one participating enemy unit and deal damage to that unit equal to the strength of the striking unit. tactics: place a number of focus tokens equal to the strength of the striking unit, on enemy units. multiple tokens may be placed on the same unit, or on different units in any combination. the unit(s) can be any controlled by the opposing player, not just his participating units. blast damage: if the striking player is attacking, he deals an amount of damage to the engaged enemy objective equal to the strength of the striking unit. if the striking unit is defending, its icon type does not resolve. when a card receives damage, place damage tokens on it equal to amount of damage received. when a card has damage tokens with value equal to or greater than its damage capacity, it is immediately destroyed. excess damage is ignored. destroyed unit cards a destroyed unit is placed faceup on its owner’s discard pile. any cards that were attached to it are placed in their respective owners’ discard piles. if a destroyed unit card was committed to the force, return its force card to its owner’s available force cards.destroyed objectives when one of your current objective cards is destroyed, place it in your opponent’s victory pile. your victory pile tracks how many of your opponent’s objective cards have been destroyed. immediately after an ls objective card is placed in the ds victory pile, the ds player advances the death star dial 1 point for each ls objective card in his victory pile. if the dial reaches 12 or higher, the ds player immediately wins the game. immediately after a ds objective card is placed in the ls victory pile, the ls player counts the number of cards in his victory pile. when the ls player has 3 or more ds objective cards in his victory pile, he immediately wins the game. any captured cards attached to a destroyed objective are rescued and returned to their owner’s hand. shield tokens some effects place a shield token on units or objectives. a shield token may not be assigned to a card that already has one. a player may discard a card’s shield token to prevent 1 damage or 1 focus token that would be placed on the shielded card by an attack or an enemy effect. 6. reward unopposed any participating unit (attacking or defending) that has not been destroyed by the end of the resolve strikes step has survived the engagement. if at least one attacking unit has survived, and there are no surviving defenders, this is an unopposed engagement and the attacking player deals 1 bonus damage to the engaged objective card (an unopposed bonus). if the engaged objective was destroyed before the reward unopposed step, there is no unopposed bonus. play now returns to the active player’s conflict phase. he may initiate a new engagement against a different enemy objective or continue to the force phase of his turn. capture and rescue when the ds player captures a card, only ls cards can be captured. attach the captured card facedown to the ds objective designated in the effect’s text. if no ds objective is specified, the ds player may choose which of his objectives the captured card is attached to. discard the captured card’s tokens, enhancements, and return its force card (if any) to its owner’s supply. the card has no characteristics, and is considered solely a captured card until rescued or discarded. if a ds objective card with one or more attached captured cards is destroyed, the captured cards are rescued and returned to their owner’s hand. when a card effect instructs the ls player to rescue a captured card, he chooses a ds objective and randomly selects one captured card there to return to his hand. custom decks to build a custom deck, choose an affiliation card as the deck’s foundation. then choose at least 10 eligible objective sets to form the deck. a deck must be built for either ls or ds play. there is no maximum number of objective sets you may include in your deck. any objective set may be included twice in a constructed deck unless its objective card states ‘limit one per objective deck’. the affiliation of an objective set does not need to match your affiliation card, unless the set’s objective card text includes ‘[name of] affiliation only’. however objective sets must still belong to the side that matches your affiliation card. neutral objective sets may also be used for custom decks."
186,179460,STRONGHOLD 2ND EDITION,2016,PORTAL GAMES / STRONGHOLD GAMES,3.7015,67,"setup one player is the defender and the other is the invader. the defender sits behind the stronghold. invader setup place all of your units in the bag. place the phase 1 and phase 6 action cards faceup on the table, then shuffle each set of phase 2, 3, 4 and 5 cards separately and randomly draw 3 cards from each set. place all the phase 2 and 3 cards, along with the phase 1 and 6 cards, in a line in ascending numerical order (phase 1 at the far left and phase 6 at the far right). you may place multiple cards with the same number in any order. place the drawn phase 4 and 5 cards facedown in an action card supply (these are open information) and remove all unused action cards from the game. place 1 white, 3 green and 1 red units on each foreground space. place 1 white and 1 green unit on the marauders space. shuffle the objective cards, draw 3, choose 2 of them and place them faceup near you. remove unused cards from the game. take 5 wood tokens into your supply and place the remaining ones aside to form a wood supply pile. place the machine hit and miss cards near the board. defender setup place the appropriate units on each wall section: each space with a colored mark receives 1 unit of the corresponding type. also place 2 wall components on each wall section. place the building tiles in the stronghold in any arrangement you like (be sure not to cover important spaces on the wall sections). place 1 marksman in the guard house. place 3 marksmen, 1 soldier and 1 veteran in the barracks. all remaining units are placed next to the board. place the heroes on the appropriate wall sections. place the heroic order tiles next to the board. shuffle the defense plan cards, draw 3, then choose 2 of them and place them facedown near you. remove the unused cards from the game. place the defender hit cards in a pile near the board. the defender takes 4 hourglasses to use after the first invader action of the first round. place the remaining hourglass tokens next to the board. place the round token on the first space of the round track. place the remaining markers and tokens near the board. at the start of every round the defender receives 2 hourglasses to use after the first invader action. therefore the defender starts the game with 6 hourglasses. the invader your goal is to breach at least 1 wall section before the end of the seventh round. goblin (strength 1) orc (strength 2) troll (strength 3) actions the action cards define your available abilities and must be resolved from left to right in ascending order. you may perform all, some, or none of these actions, but you must have the required amount of resources (units and wood) available in your supply to pay for every action used. place these resources on the action card to mark that it has been used. if you do not have enough resources available to pay for an action, you cannot take that action. units already on the board may not be used to pay for actions. each action may only be performed once per round and only in order from left to right. once an action has been used or skipped over, you cannot perform that action again this round. the defender receives 1 hourglass for every unit you spend. if an hourglass is shown in the cost, this is an additional requirement to pay the defender that number of hourglasses. after you perform an action, the defender must spend all the hourglasses in his supply (if any). after the defender spends all his hourglasses, you proceed with your next action. the game continues back and forth in this manner through all 9 action cards, and then the assault commences. after the seventh round, the game ends. objectives each objective has a goal and a benefit; when the goal is met, you must resolve the benefit. blood magic, not a single stone, and devoted warlocks remain in play once they are fulfilled. all other objectives are discarded. invader actions phase 1: supplies briefing randomly draw 14 units from the bag and place them in your supply. add to them 5 wood from the wood supply pile. then, at a one-off cost of 1 hourglass, you may exchange any number of action phase cards with those available in your supply. phase 1 and 6 cards may never be exchanged. cards of the same phase number may be rearranged by taking this action. during the first round, you may only exchange the phase 2 and 3 action cards with the phase 4 and 5 cards that were drawn and make up your supply of action cards. resources you may, at a cost of 1 hourglass: discard 1 goblin to gain 1 or discard 1 orc to gain 2 or discard 1 troll to gain 3 . you can acquire up to 8 wood per round (5 for briefing + 3 if a troll is used for resources). phase 2: siege machines when built, place the corresponding machine tile on an appropriate space of your choice. the ballista, catapult, and trebuchet are barrage weapons. when built, shuffle together a machine card deck of 2 hit and 4 miss cards and place it facedown on the machine tile. you can have a maximum of 4 barrage weapons on the board. ballista location: rampart. effect: may fire at any wall section connected by paths to this rampart. kills 1 defender and 1 invader unit on the target wall section. catapult location: rampart. effect: may fire at any wall section connected by paths to this rampart. destroys 1 wall component on the chosen wall section. if there are none, destroy a cauldron instead. if there are no cauldrons, target the tower (removing a cannon/pole/bay window placed there). mantelet location: rampart. effect: marksmen attacks on this rampart have no effect. mantelets do not protect units from cannons and the sharpshooter action. siege tower location: foreground. siege towers move towards the walls like any other unit. effect: wall components and cauldrons are not resolved during a combat where the siege tower is present.trebuchet location: foreground. effect: may fire at any wall

does not apply to the artilleryman, trainer and saboteur trainings; see below). artilleryman effect: remove 1 miss card from any machine card pile and reshuffle. you may train artillery- men for the same siege machine in subsequent rounds. quartermaster location: rampart. effect: during the maneuver phase, 1 unit may ignore this rampart and proceed directly to the walls. saboteur location: building. effect: actions at this building cost +1 hourglass. trainer effect: draw 2 trolls from the bag and place them on any empty foreground spaces. trench master location: rampart. effect: cannon attacks have no effect at this rampart. phase 5: rituals each ritual has 1 target token and 2 bluff tokens. each time a ritual is selected, place up to 3 corresponding tokens on up to 3 different spaces facedown as required by the ritual. the defender does not know which space is the true target. rituals trigger when the action/space they are on is used. flip the token: discard a bluff to your supply. target means the ritual is resolved; keep the token on the board until the end of the round. when the round ends, return all ritual tokens to your supply. a ritual may be paid for and performed again in future rounds. bloodstones location: barrage siege machines (ballista, catapult, and trebuchet). effect: when the target siege machine hits a wall, kill +1 defender unit of your

specter location: wall sections. effect: defender units killed at the wall section are placed on the foregrounds as invader units of equal strength (replace them with previously discarded invader units).phase 6: maneuver and orders all remaining units you have not used in previous actions may be sent to attack the stronghold. any invader units which are on the walls may be issued orders. unused units remain in the supply. maneuvers you have 2 maneuver actions: minor and major. at least one of the maneuvers has to be performed each round. you may perform either maneuver, or both in any order, but may only perform each maneuver action once. each has to be taken one at a time. you may move any mix of units from both foregrounds, all the ramparts, as well as from the supply. units can only move along the paths on the board. units may only move to a location if there is a space available. each foreground may hold a maximum of 10 invader units. each rampart may hold a maximum of 7 invader units. units may not enter a foreground or rampart which is full. the defender receives hourglasses for phase 6 actions after all maneuvers are complete and orders are given (not separately after minor and then major maneuver actions). you may not withdraw units from the walls. minor maneuver effect: you may move up to 5 units from each rampart to attached wall sections, and 5 units from each foreground to connected ramparts. additionally, up to 5 units may be moved from the supply to each foreground, for a total of 10 new units on the board. major maneuver effect: you may move up to 7 units from each rampart to attached wall sections, and 7 units from each foreground to connected ramparts. additionally, up to 7 units may be moved from the supply to each foreground, for a total of 14 new units on the board. move units in the following order: 1. sap units to the walls 2. ramparts to the walls 3. foreground to the ramparts 4. supply to the foregrounds the board paths on the bottom right side of the stronghold (defender’s view) require units to move through 1 rampart before reaching the outermost rampart. your units move first from the outermost rampart to a connected wall section, then new units from the previous rampart may move there. on the right side of the stronghold (defender’s view), there is a marauders space between the final 2 ramparts. during both the minor and major maneuvers, if you move any unit to the final rampart, add the 1 goblin and 1 orc marauders to the last rampart as a bonus, then replace them on the marauders space with the same units from the bag. orders you may now give orders to units at wall sections. if possible, at least 1 invader unit must carry out the given order. if all units die at a wall section with an order present, remove the order from the game without resolving its effect. place order tokens at the chosen wall section in such a way that there are no doubts which wall section they affect. only one of these 2 ways of issuing orders may be used each turn: open order cost: none. effect: place 1 order token faceup at a chosen wall section. classified order cost: 1 hourglass. effect: place any number of order tokens facedown and flip them faceup during the assault. only 1 order counter may be placed on each wall section.goblin fury effect: the strength of each goblin at this wall section is 3. after the assault all goblins here are killed. if the strength of the goblins is enough to win the combat and break into the stronghold, they will do so even if there are no other invader units on that wall section. if the defender has the advantage on the wall in combat, the affected goblins are removed from the board before your losses are calculated. orc detonation effect: at least 1 of the orcs detonate. remove any number of orcs at this wall section. each orc removed destroys 1 wall component at this wall section. detonated orcs are removed from the board before the assault is resolved. call of the trolls effect: if you have a troll at this wall section, order another troll on this side of the stronghold to maneuver. this troll must immediately move 1 step towards the wall section where the order has been given. the troll trap affects the extra troll as normal. bluff counter effect: used to mislead the defender. it does not modify any unit attributes or actions. the defender your goal is to keep the invader from breaching the stronghold for 7 turns. marksman (str 1) soldier (str 2) veteran (str 3) after each invader action, you must spend all the hourglasses in your supply, placing them in the spaces next to the appropriate action. placing an hourglass on an action’s last free space activates that action. when all the hourglasses are spent, the invader takes his next action. if you receive no hourglasses, the invader starts the next action immediately. movement move units and heroes cost: 1 hourglass per move. effect: any unit or hero can be moved to any free space as follows: – from a wall section or tower to a connected wall section or tower – from a wall section or tower to any building or the courtyard – from a building or the courtyard to any spot on the board only marksmen may move into the towers and each tower may only hold 2 marksmen. you cannot move units to the forge, the workshop, the scouts, the hospital or the cathedral. heroes may only move on wall sections and to/from the courtyard. you may move any number of units each turn, and individual units may move multiple times. discard the hourglasses used to pay for movement actions. swap spaces cost: 1 hourglass per swap. effect: instead of moving to a free space, a unit may swap places with another unit in an adjacent space. heroes may also swap in this manner. wall sections on either side of a tower are adjacent, and barracks, guards, and the courtyard are adjacent to all spaces. the two wall sections adjacent to the front gate are not adjacent. you may move any number of units each turn. discard the hourglasses used to pay for movement actions. defense plans at any time during the game, you may choose to use the defense plans chosen at the start of the game. once used, all defense plans have a negative section that affects you in different ways. most defense plans are retained for the rest of the game and continue to impact you.heroes the warrior (strength 2) and officer (strength 3) heroes affect their wall sections differently. they cannot be killed and are not considered units. each may also perform 1 heroic order per turn; these do not cost hourglasses and may be used during any defender phase. each heroic order may only be used once per turn. – move 1 unit from the courtyard to a wall section where a hero is present. – move any unit to any building (except for the guards and the barracks) and gain 1 hourglass to use on the chosen building. – move 1 unit from any wall section, on the same side of the stronghold as the hero, to the courtyard. defender actions you do not need all the hourglasses necessary to complete a specific action at one time; they may be built up over a series of defender phases or rounds. each action may only be performed once per turn unless otherwise noted. after the round is over, remove all hourglasses used on completed actions. if there is a saboteur token on a building, it increases the cost of the actions in that building by 1 hourglass. place the additional hourglass on the building tile’s red hourglass space. each tower may only have 1 cannon, pole, or bay window. barracks train troops effect: replace a unit in the barracks: either 1 marksman with 1 soldier, or 1 soldier with 1 veteran. the replaced unit goes back to your supply. train troop actions may be used multiple times during a turn. if a new unit can not be placed on an appropriate space in the barracks, the action may not be performed. cathedral marksman blessing location: one side of the stronghold. effect: during ranged combat, marksmen on this side of the stronghold not engaged in melee combat fire all together at any single rampart on this side of the stronghold. orders mix-up location: none. effect: discard 1 invader order without revealing it. sharpshooters location: none. effect: kill 1 invader unit anywhere on the board. unearthly glare location: wall section. effect: the assault is not resolved at this wall section. remove the token at the end of the round. courtyard the courtyard can hold any number of units and heroes. there are no special actions here: it is simply a holding place for unassigned units. forge cannon location: tower. effect: during ranged combat, choose the foreground on this side of the stronghold, or the rampart opposite the tower or adjacent to that rampart on this side. reveal the top card of the defender hit deck for each cannon and on a hit, kill one of the indicated units (your choice). after all cannons have shot, reshuffle the hit deck. cauldron location: wall section. effect: during melee combat, kill invader unit(s): a troll or orc cauldron kills 1 corresponding unit at that wall section; a goblin cauldron kills all goblins there.guards tracking saboteurs effect: remove 1 marksman on the guards from the game to remove all saboteur tokens from the stronghold (return them to the invader). hospital place all defender units which die this turn in the hospital. at the end of each turn 2 of these units (your choice) recover and are moved to the courtyard. the rest of the units at the hospital go back to the supply. scouts malfunction location: ballista, catapult, or trebuchet. effect: this weapon may not fire during the next assault phase. after the phase discard this token. spy location: invader action card. effect: the invader must pay +1 unit when activating the card. the spy may not be placed on phase 1 or 6 cards, and stays until the card is exchanged. trap location: path (place facedown). a maximum of 1 trap may be built on a single path. effect: when the invader moves over a trap reveal it. target units are affected as follows: troll: kill 1 troll goblin: kill all goblinssiege tower: the siege tower cannot move this maneuver (it may move in subsequent maneuvers to take another path). workshop bay window location: tower. effect: gain 1 strength at both wall sections adjacent to this tower during melee combat if there is at least 1 marksman in the tower. ladder location: wall section. effect: +1 defender unit space at this wall section. pole location: tower. effect: during melee combat, choose 1 wall section adjacent to this tower. reveal the top card of the defender hit deck for each pole. on a hit, kill the weakest of the indicated invader units on that wall section. after all poles have been resolved, reshuffle the hit deck. wall location: wall section. effect: place 1 wall component on any wall section. there is no limit to the number of wall components you may have on a single wall section. the assault phase 6 ends when the defender spends all his hourglasses. then the assault commences, played in the following stages: ranged combat 1. cannons the defender selects which foreground or rampart each cannon will fire upon. turn over 1 hit card per cannon and check the cannon portion of the card: remove 1 unit of the type indicated. after all cannons have fired, reshuffle the hit cards and place them next to the board. 2. siege machines the invader selects a wall section each siege machine will fire upon. reveal the top card of each siege machine deck and resolve all hits. discard all miss cards and return all hit cards to their deck facedown. reshuffle all machine card decks. 3. marksmen marksmen on the walls not currently engaged in melee combat and marksmen in the towers may fire at invader units. marksmen on walls fire at the ramparts connected to their wall section by paths. marksmen in a tower fire at any ramparts opposite the tower.every firing marksman adds +1 to the volley strength at that rampart. the total volley strength determines the total strength of the invader units killed. the defender chooses which units to kill. if there are invader units on a given wall section, the marksmen on that section are engaged in melee combat and cannot shoot. marksmen in towers are never in melee combat. melee combat 1. cauldrons the invader removes units killed by each cauldron. 2. poles each pole may attack 1 wall section adjacent to the tower equipped with it. for each pole, the defender declares which wall section is being attacked, and reveals the top card of the hit deck. check the pole section of the card. if a hit is shown, discard the invader unit with the lowest strength attacking that wall section. reshuffle the hit deck after resolving all attacks. 3. orders the invader reveals all order tokens (if they were facedown) and resolves the effect of each order. 4. resolve strength both players sum the total strength of their respective units on each wall section. invader strength point(s) 1 goblin unit 1 (3 if goblin fury order was issued) 1 orc unit 2 1 troll unit 3 1 banner 1 defender strength point(s) 1 marksman unit 1 1 soldier unit 2 1 veteran unit 3 1 wall component 1 1 bay window with at least 1 marksman on it 1 the officer 3 the warrior 2 melee combat at each wall section is won by the player with the highest total strength. subtract the losing player’s strength from the winning player’s total to find the advantage. the losing player must lose units (counted in strength points) equal to the advantage. invader units are killed and removed from the game; defender units are placed in the hospital. any time your units are killed as a result of combat or action, your opponent chooses which of your units are killed. if the advantage is greater than the strength of all defender units on the wall, the invader has breached the wall (even if there is a wall piece or hero there). the game ends and the invader wins. end of the turn before the next turn begins: 1. remove all tokens which expire with the end of the turn. 2. the invader removes all units and wood from his action cards. remove units from the game; return wood to the wood supply. 3. the defender removes all hourglasses from completed actions. 4. move the round token 1 space. the defender now receives 2 hourglasses to use after the

(swamp orc vine walls have special rules.) event cards are played one at a time, resolved immediately, then placed faceup on your discard pile. wall cards are placed on any empty space on your side of the battlefield.4. movement you may move up to 3 of your units, up to 2 spaces each. cards cannot move diagonally or through occupied spaces. no unit may be moved more than once per turn unless an event or special ability says otherwise. 5. attack you may attack with up to 3 different units that you control on the battlefield. the units do not have to be the same ones you just moved. resolve each attack in turn. you may attack and destroy your own cards, but a card may not attack itself. no unit may attack more than once per turn unless an event or special ability says otherwise. sword symbol attack these cards can only attack orthogonally adjacent cards. bow symbol attack these cards can attack cards up to 3 spaces away in an orthogonal straight line unblocked by other cards. resolving an attack roll dice equal to the attacking unit’s attack value (large number in shield): 3+ is a hit, 2 or lower a miss. for every hit, add 1 wound marker to the target card. if you add enough to destroy a unit or wall, place that enemy card facedown on top of your magic pile. 6. build magic you may take any number of cards from your hand and put them facedown on top of your magic pile. special abilities special abilities take precedence over the regular rules. you may announce that a unit is moving 0 spaces in order to activate a special ability activated by movement, but this counts as moving one of your units. victory you are victorious when you are the only player with a summoner on the battlefield.a wall card is a special type of event card; they do not have a card name or a game effect, just a number of life points. walls are not units, but can be attacked and destroyed like units. they are not affected by abilities or powers which only affect units. walls give your units something to hide behind and block your opponent’s movement. they are also a summoning point: units summoned to the game must be placed adjacent to a wall card you control. if you control no walls you cannot summon more units to your aid. vine walls the swamp orcs have a special kind of wall called a vine wall. vine wall cards are not shuffled into your deck. if you have vine walls listed on your summoner’s reference card, start the game with that many vine wall cards in a vine wall pile off off the battlefield. whenever a card instructs you to place a vine wall, remove one from this pile and place it as directed. vine walls are considered wall cards for all purposes with the following exceptions: 1. life: vine walls have 2 life points. 2. placement: vine walls can be placed on any space on the battlefield, even where a unit already exists (place the vine wall under the unit). however, you can never place a vine wall on a space where a wall/vine wall already exists. a unit cannot be summoned onto a space containing a vine wall, but they can be summoned adjacent to one as normal.3. movement: units can move or be placed onto a space containing a vine wall. when a unit moves off of a space containing a vine wall, roll a die. on a 3 or less, the unit receives 1 wound marker and cannot move off of the vine wall space. on a 4+, the unit moves normally. a unit can never use an event or special ability to move through a unit on a vine wall. 4. attacking: a vine wall can be attacked even if there is a unit sharing its space. declare whether you are attacking the unit or the vine wall before attacking. units on a vine wall space are considered to be adjacent to that vine wall and can attack it. a vine wall blocks los like a normal wall, even if there is a unit on top of it. however, it does not block los to or from that unit on top of it. those units that share spaces with vine walls can attack and be attacked from any direction unless blocked by another card. 5. destroying: when a vine wall is destroyed, it is placed back onto the owner’s vine wall pile rather than a magic pile. some special abilities refer to cards that are placed underneath vine walls and impact them in some unique way. for the sake of interpreting these type of rules, vine walls are not considered to be a card under those units. remember that a unit on a vine wall space is considered adjacent to that vine wall, even though they are sharing a space.wall cards"
188,194517,SUPER FANTASY BRAWL,2021,MYTHIC GAMES,2.3016,63,"setup choose a start player randomly; that player chooses a deployment area, and places the first player token next to their gate. players decide if they wish to freely choose a team of champions, or draft a team using the casual or competitive draft rules. players take base rings of their chosen colour and attach them to their champion miniatures. they then place their team on their player gate, and their champion cards and 3 cores of magic, one of each colour (manipulation , destruction , and creation ), on their player board. each player takes the 3 action decks for their champions and shuffles them together to form their draw deck. shuffle the deck of 11 challenge cards. draw a card and place it in the cannot be scored slot (the one with no trophy symbol). place the victory and damage tokens near the board. place all the traps facedown near the board. the first player places traps facedown on 2 trap hexes of their choice (without looking at them). the second player places traps facedown on 2 trap hexes of their choice (without looking at them). the first player draws a hand of 5 cards from their draw deck. they may discard any number of them, drawing a new card for each one they discard. shuffle discarded cards back into the draw deck. then the second player draws a hand of 5 cards from their draw deck and may discard in the same way. the first player places their champions onto unoccupied hexes in their deployment area. then the second player places their champions onto unoccupied hexes in their deployment area. champions under your opponent’s control are enemies. your own champions are allies. when a champion’s card effect refers to allies or an ally, it does not include the champion to whom the card belongs. the arena board is made up of a series of hexes. a continuous line of hexes is called a hex row. game sequence the game is played in successive rounds and stops when a player wins by reaching 5 or more 5 victory points (vp). each round consists of 3 steps: first player’s turn, second player’s turn, and advance challenge track. on a turn, players perform these phases in order: 1. scoreboard phase the active player checks if they currently meet the scoring conditions of any active challenges. completing a challenge earns you a number of vp tokens equal to the vps based on the challenge card’s position on the challenge track. discard any scored challenges. challenges cannot be scored during the first round.2. activation phase the active player may activate champions by playing action cards that belong to that champion, or by using standard actions. play actions by exhausting (flipping over) the core of the matching colour. the other player may play reaction cards. players may play cards in any combination, and as many as they like, as long as they have the matching core to play it. champions may be activated more than once per turn as long as the appropriate core can be exhausted. an action card must be completely resolved before the same player may play another. movement champions may move up to the number of hexes indicated by the value on the action card. they do not have to move the full distance, or move at all. hexes containing statues or enemies are blocked: champions cannot normally move through or end their movement in them. champions may move through, but not end on, hexes containing allies. champions can move into hexes containing trap tokens, but this usually triggers the trap. if a champion has a movement bonus, it is applied to each action card and standard action used to activate them, but only if the action card has a printed value. since all cards are resolved from top to bottom, movement printed on a card’s happens first before all other effects. when an effect requires you to place a champion, remove it from its current hex and place it in the new location. this is not considered movement. attacks every action card with the attack icon in the upper left corner is an attack card. to resolve an attack: 1. use as much of the card’s movement as you wish. 2. resolve any abilities. 3. choose if you will use the attack. if you decide not to, the activation ends immediately. otherwise, proceed. 4. declare target(s). 5. the opponent chooses whether to play reactions. 6. subtract the target’s defence value from the current strength value of the attack. 7. resolve attack damage. 8. if the defender is not taken out of action, resolve abilities from reactions. 9. if the attacker is not taken out of action, resolve abilities from the attack card. declare target(s) check the range and targeting icons to determine which targeting rules apply. if an attack has a minimum range, any enemy closer than that range is not an eligible target. the light grey hex in the targeting box marks the relative position of the attacking champion to the yellow target hex(es). melee attack: targets a single adjacent enemy. indirect shot: targets a single enemy. the targeting value is the action’s maximum range. when this is one number, it is the maximum range; when it is 2 numbers, the first is the minimum range and the second is the maximum range. count the number of hexes to the target, including the target’s hex but not the activating champion’s hex. indirect shots can target champions through statues and other champions.direct shot: like an indirect shot, but may only target enemies on hexes in the same row of hexes as the attacking champion. direct shots cannot target champions if there are any statues, or other champions (enemy or ally) in the hex row between the activating champion and target. area of effect (aoe): this attack affects all champions in the yellow hexes shown in the icon (including allies). the player playing the action chooses the aoe’s orientation. play reactions after targets are declared, the controller of an enemy target champion may play 1 reaction card on any of their champions targeted. the core of the reaction card must be exhausted as normal. only 1 reaction may be played per attack. subtract the target’s defence value from the current strength value all champions have a defence value. a printed defence value of 0 can be modified by card effects, but if a defence of 0 is reduced, it remains 0. subtract the current defence value of the defender from the current strength value of the attack, including any modifiers to those values. defence values are always applied to every attack made against the champion, unless reduced or bypassed by a card effect. the final value is the attack damage. resolve attack damage deal the attack damage to all targets of the attack. place on the champion card damage tokens equal to the damage the champion is dealt. resolve any keywords that affect damage. pre-attack and post-attack pre-attack ( ) and post-attack ( ) abilities are mandatory effects that take place when an attack card with either symbol is played. if a card instructs a player to resolve a or ability, then it must be fully resolved before moving on to the next step of the attack. a player may play a card with a ability, and then choose not to attack, whereas a ability is only ever resolved after an attack is made. many keywords have numerical values, so can be legally resolved by choosing 0, effectively cancelling the effect. skills when you activate a champion using a skill card, resolve these steps: 1. use as much of the card’s movement as you choose. 2. choose if you will use the skill. if you choose not to, the activation ends immediately. 3. declare target(s), if necessary. 4. resolve the text box of the skill card. defence values do not help against effects that deal . standard actions you may also activate champions using the standard actions shown on your player dashboard. each standard action may only be used once per activation phase. 1. spend the manipulation core to move 1 and plan 1. 2. spend the creation core to move 1 and heal 1. 3. spend the destruction core to move 1 and deal 1 damage to an adjacent enemy. this damage ignores defence. 4. spend 1 core, manipulation or creation or destruction , to move 2.reactions during an opponent’s turn, players can react to their opponent’s attacks by playing reaction cards. reactions may only be played during the opponent’s turn and only when at least one of that player’s champions is targeted by an opponent’s attack action. reaction cards are played by players, not champions. reactions can target any of a player’s champions, not just the champion whose card is being played. you cannot play more than 1 reaction card per attack action, even if more than 1 champion is targeted by the attack. when playing a reaction during an aoe attack, you must choose which of your champions will be targeted by the reaction. when reaction cards cause effects like push, pull, or , the target of the reaction card is the champion causing that effect. the target of the effect itself is noted on the reaction card. if a reaction causes an enemy to be taken out of action, the champion on whom the reaction card was played will level up if possible, and the player will gain 1 vp. 3. upkeep phase players ready (flip back over) their cores: therefore a player will always have all their cores available to play reactions against their opponent’s actions. however any exhausted cores will not be available on the player’s next turn, so they won’t be able to play cards of that colour. players then discard any cards that remain in their hand, and draw a new hand of 5 cards. advance challenge track at the end of each game round (after all players have taken a turn), move all challenge cards 1 space to the right, and draw a new challenge card. place this in the cannot be scored space. discard challenges moving right from the rightmost space (move them to the challenge discard pile). if at any point the challenge card deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck. out of action a champion is taken out of action as soon as they suffer an amount of damage equal to or greater than their hitpoint value. if, during their activation, a champion takes an enemy out of action, the attacking champion’s player gains 1 vp, and the attacking champion levels up. remove all the damage suffered by the out of action champion, and if they had levelled up, flip their champion card back over to the basic side. then place the champion on their team’s gate until they are activated again. while champions are on their gate they cannot be affected by card effects, can never be targeted by actions or attacks, and cannot target champions on the hex grid. to activate an out of action champion, you must use an action with to move them back into the arena. the first hex of movement must be spent moving the champion onto one of their team’s deployment area hexes. out of action champions may not be activated using action cards without . once in the arena, they may use any remaining movement to move further, and complete the action. if during their activation a champion takes themselves or an ally out of action, their opponent gains 1 vp. if a card takes a champion from each team out of action simultaneously, both players gain 1 vp and level up the appropriate champions. if this would end the game in a draw, the player who didn’t play the card wins.levelling up when an enemy is taken out of action, the champion currently being activated levels up after the action is fully resolved. flip the champion card and move any damage tokens to the levelled up side. the champion uses the stats and effects of the levelled up side until they are taken out of action. if the champion was already levelled up before the knock out, nothing happens. level up effects are always active. traps traps are always placed facedown, and trigger as soon as a champion enters the same hex, whether they moved deliberately or were pushed, pulled, or otherwise displaced onto that hex. the player controlling the champion that triggered the trap flips the trap token and applies the effect to the champion. the champion may then complete any remaining movement they have available, unless prevented from doing so by the trap effect. there should always be 4 trap tokens on the map. as soon as a trap is triggered and its effects applied, the player whose champion triggered the trap takes a new trap token from the supply, place it facedown on a different empty trap hex without looking at it, then shuffles the old trap back into the trap supply. if all trap hexes are blocked by champions and/or traps, the trap token may be placed anywhere adjacent to a trap hex that is not blocked by a champion or statue. in addition to the trap hexes on the board, any hex that currently contains a trap is considered a trap hex. if the trap was triggered because of a card effect, the damage is considered to be caused by the source of that effect. this may result in levelling up champions as normal. the champion suffers the amount of damage indicated (ignoring the defence value). the champion the champion suffers root. suffers stun.other rules strength and damage some cards and effects deal damage , and others state the strength of the attack. is always reduced by the defence of the target, while is applied directly to the target, ignoring any defence. targeting unless a card says otherwise, champions can only target enemy champions. area of effect (aoe) attacks that include an enemy champion in the aoe fulfil this condition, even if an ally is also in the aoe. towards and away when an effect instructs a champion to move towards a game element, each step should decrease the distance between the champion and the game element, if possible. if this is not possible, the champion will not move. when an effect instructs a champion to move away from a game element, each step should increase the distance between the champion and the game element. if this is not possible, the champion will not move. when applying a push or pull effect, if a champion cannot move the full distance for any reason, they suffer equal to the remaining distance. displacement effects fear , force, pull, and push are all displacement effects. effects that negate displacement effects negate any damage those effects would cause. cards if you are instructed to draw cards from an empty deck, shuffle your discard pile to form a new draw deck. if the effect of a card directly conflicts with any main rules, the text on the card takes precedence. when resolving a card, if a card cannot be fully resolved, forfeit the part that cannot be resolved. modifiers only apply on printed numbers (even if the printed number is a 0). open and hidden information each player’s hand is hidden information, and should not be shared with another player unless a game effect instructs a player to do so. when a card effect asks a player to show something, all players may see the revealed information. players can ask to see their opponent’s discard pile and either side of a champion card at any time. when a card effect asks a player to look at something, only that player may see the revealed information. winning the game the first player to reach 5 vp immediately wins the game.drafting casual draft 1. form a common pool of unique champions (minimum 6). 2. the second player drafts

mark your starting energy and terror levels by placing cubes in their starting slots. place the t-shaped health marker in its starting slot (starting slots are highlighted with 2 red chevrons). record your starting attributes, as noted on the back of your character tile. record your starting resources, also noted on the back of your character tile, by placing the corresponding numbers of cubes in the resource slots on your character tray. set aside the 80 combat and diplomacy cards that match the color of your character tray (there are 50 basic combat and diplomacy cards that match your character tray, and 30 advanced combat and diplomacy cards with your character’s name above their title). pick the 15 basic combat and the 15 basic diplomacy cards with a banner that matches your tray’s color. shuffle these cards and place them to the left (combat) and right (diplomacy) of your character tray. characters from other campaigns must refer to the starter deck lists found on the back of their character tile. in the fall of avalon campaign, the starter cards used are numbered 1-15/25. starter cards do not have character names on them. take the 15 advanced combat cards (they have your character’s name on them), then the 10 remaining basic combat cards of the color matching your character tray (the ones without the banner, that weren’t used to create your starter deck). shuffle these 15 advanced cards with the 10 basic cards to form your 25 card combat advancement pool. repeat these steps with the diplomacy cards to build your diplomacy advancement pool. place both advancement pools in one of the save compartments in the box or cover them with the advancement pool cards. place your character tile on the character tray (character actions faceup). read your character’s introductory letter (this also gives you your character number, used to break ties and unresolved votes). take your adventure map. place the starting location card in the middle of your play area and place your character models on it. the starting location for the fall of avalon campaign is #101; other campaigns use locations #201, #301, and #401. place 1 menhir model on the starting location and put a dial in the slot under it. turn the dial so that it shows 8 (for 1 player), 7 (for 2 players), 6 (for 3 players) or 5 (for 4 players). find the 4 location cards with the location numbers corresponding to the 4 direction keys on the 4 edges of your starting card and place each of them next to its matching key. take all the encounter cards and sort them by color into 4 piles. each pile should contain 31 cards, including a special encounter marked ‘your first encounter’. shuffle the item cards and sort the secret cards by number. place both decks next to the encounters. take a fresh save sheet. this is used to save your game and to mark statuses that permanently change the way some locations and people respond to your group. each player should takes 1 icon guide card and 1 turn order card with the action list on the back. leave the combat / diplomacy help card on the table.optionally, choose one player to be the chronicler to maintain the flow of the game (recommended in cooperative games with 2-4 players). the chronicler is responsible for: reading (or re-telling) paragraphs of the exploration journal aloud to other players; performing upkeep tasks, such as revealing new event cards and reducing all dials at the start of the day; maintaining the save sheet, marking any statuses gained by players, and checking the statuses when asked; adding new location cards and removing location cards no longer in a range of an active menhir; dealing item and secret cards from their decks; and breaking ties and making the final decision in any conflict. follow the instructions on the chapter i setup card, starting from the front side, to build the event deck and encounter decks. shuffle the random event cards and place them to the side of your play area or in the box. the event cards will sometimes ask you to put a certain number of these random events on top of the event deck (always draw from the deck, never from the random event pile). when you discard a location, random event, encounter, secret, or item card, place it on the bottom of its deck. the event deck has its own discard pile. shuffle discarded or destroyed combat and diplomacy cards back into your combat or diplomacy deck when the encounter ends. if you must remove a card from the game, it is no longer a part of the campaign and should not return to any deck, unless you’re specifically instructed otherwise. the order of the day 1. start of the day 1. remove expired menhirs. if a menhir has no dial in the slot of its base, it becomes inactive: remove it from the table. any menhirs still on the table are active menhirs. 2. remove locations out of menhir range. each location card should be adjacent (in a straight line or diagonally) to a location with an active menhir. discard any location cards that are not. all characters on a location card removed in this way immediately lose 2 , gain 2 , and are moved to the nearest remaining location card (if there are several the same distance away, choose the lowest-numbered one). this is not a travel action. 3. reduce menhir dials. reduce the dial of each active menhir by 1. if it was already at 1, remove the dial from under the menhir. the menhir itself won’t disappear or become inactive until the next start of the day . 4. reduce time dials and remove time tokens. if there are any dials with time tokens on them, including on the secret cards or next to characters, reduce them by 1. if a dial can no longer be reduced, remove it from the game. remove 1 time token from every location card that has any on it. do not remove any quest tokens from any location. 5. reveal and read a new event card. if the card has quest text and a red padlock symbol, move it to the quest pile, next to the event deck. unlike regular events that stay active for 1 day, quest events remain on the table until specified. 6. move guardians. if there are any guardians on the table, roll the direction die for each of them and move them. 7. discuss your plans. if you are playing co-op, all players should take time to discuss their plans. 8. equip for your journey. make sure your character doesn’t have more than 1 item with the same keyword faceup. flip any excess items facedown.2. during the day each player performs 1 action, in any order players agree on. if they cannot agree, the character with the lowest character number goes first. each action in the game is marked with an action icon that also indicates its cost in energy . a group of 2 or more players sharing the same location may agree to take the same action together, at the same time, as a party. once every player has performed 1 action or taken part in 1 party action or passed, players once again perform 1 action each. this continues until all characters have passed or run out of , when players proceed to the end of the day . explore (cost 1 ) flip your current location card and read the text. some cards are self-contained, and some refer to the exploration journal. continue exploration in the journal until you reach exploration ends. then flip the location card back and continue the game. if you don’t want to flip the card, every location in the exploration journal starts with the same text that is on the back of the card. in a party: the cost of exploration is 1 per party member. most effects apply to every character in the party, but rewards will usually have to be shared. travel (cost 1 ) move your character to any location card connected to your current one. the adjacent edges must share the same direction keys. move only in straight lines; no diagonal travel is allowed. when you arrive in a new location: 1. find the cards that match the direction keys on the edges of your new location. attach them to the corresponding keys if the card you are trying to attach is no further than 1 card away (including diagonally) from an active menhir. 2. if a guardian is present in the location, resolve the encounter. 3. check whether the new location has an instant action . any rule marked with must be resolved now. in a party: the cost of travel is 1 per party member. any automatic action or guardian encounter triggered by your new location must be resolved as a party. location (cost ? ) see the cost on the location card. you may activate the action on a location card whenever you are present in the location and not involved in some other action. when you perform an action marked once per day, cover its icon with a time token to indicate it has been used. some locations track other rules with time tokens. in a party: you may activate a location action as a party. pay the cost only once and receive the output of the action once. players in the party may help each other pay costs, splitting them any way they want; if they trigger an encounter, they resolve it as a party. character (cost ? ) every character has a personal action on their character tile which can only be activated outside of encounters and exploration. in a party: only your character can use your character action, but party members may help pay the cost. the character performing the action must always pay at least 1 . inspect a menhir (cost 0 ) if the location you are in has a menhir seal next to its name, it contains a menhir. you may ispecting the menhir for free by flipping the location card and reading the menhir section at the bottom. if you have the required resources and meet all criteria, you may activate the menhir. activating menhirs is only possible in locations that have the menhir seal next to their name. all costs of activating a menhir scale up with the total number of players in the game. if you don’t want to flip the card, all menhir information is in the corresponding location in the exploration journal.pass (cost 0 ) you may pass even if you have unspent , but once you’ve passed, you cannot take any more actions until the next day. 3. end of the day every character performs these steps: 1. rest eat 1 food. if you do, restore 1 and lose 1 . if you don’t have enough food (or you don’t want to eat it now), drop your to 0. if your is already at 0, lose 1 instead. 2. restore your energy return the marker on your track to the starting slot. if you’re exhausted (your marker is in one of the last 2 red slots), restore only 4 points of . your marker can never be moved past your marker. 3. advance your character you may spend any of your exp points to raise your attributes, gain new skills or add new combat and diplomacy cards to your deck. 4. build your character decks you may customize your combat and diplomacy decks with any cards you gained from the advancement pool. 5. experience dreams if the location you’re in has a dream icon, open the appropriate section of the exploration journal and read the dream. if your marker is on one of the red slots (ie, the you are going insane card is attached to your character tray), read the nightmare instead. character attributes your character is defined by 6 basic attributes, divided into 3 opposing pairs. after you raise any attribute to 2, every subsequent point of that attribute provides a special skill card that attaches to the side of your character tray next to the attribute. aggression empathy courage caution practicality spirituality resources food at each end of the day , your character should eat 1 unit of food. without food, you cannot regenerate. weal th gold, gems and other riches can help you buy life- saving items and equipment. reputation (rep) fame and glory; if you have many rep points, people will go out of their way to help you. magic supernatural power may help you during encounters, and is often required to enable menhirs. experience (exp) spent on raising your attributes and buying new combat and diplomacy cards. food and wealth may be traded with party members or any other characters in the same location who are not involved in an action. locations location cards make up the map of avalon. the location number refers to the corresponding location in the exploration journal. each location card may have up to 3 location seals: menhir: the location contains a menhir you can activate. dreams: if you end your day in this location, dreams or nightmares come to you in your sleep. friendly/unfriendly settlement: this location triggers an encounter as soon as you enter it.special movement some cards and effects ask you to move your character to the ‘lowest-numbered revealed location’, ‘any connected location’, etc. this special move does not count as travel, costs nothing, and is performed instantly. it does however reveal further location cards and trigger any instant actions and guardian encounters. legacy location numbers when location cards change, their number also changes, since they receive a new section in the exploration journal. the original location number (the legacy location number) can still be found on the card; use it when connecting the direction keys. when you visit any location, if the location card with a number indicated by the direction key is no longer available in the game, check the legacy location number instead. menhirs you may extend the remaining duration of an active menhir by activating it again. any remaining power left on the dial is lost at the moment of new activation, and you do not add a new menhir model in the location. if the last menhir on the map goes out, do not remove the last remaining location cards. the characters may continue to play in these locations, but they lose 2 and gain 2 at each start of the day until they die or activate one of the menhirs. quests and tasks quests are the main missions that lead to the end of the chapter and let you progress through the campaign. they are on either event or secret cards and are marked by a red padlock symbol. whenever you draw a card with a quest, read it and place it in the active quests pile, next to the event deck. never remove any cards with a quest unless you’re instructed to do so. tasks are small side missions or clues you may choose to pursue. they have no separate cards and no defined end conditions. they are not tied to the chapter and may be completed at any point (until your actions permanently change the location card they are on). consider taking notes whenever you get a new task. parties and party actions players may form a group or split up as they see fit. whenever any character takes any action, other characters in the same location may decide to join them. if the character performing the action agrees, all characters form a party and take the action together. all characters in a party are referred to as party members. party members can trade food, wealth, items and secrets at any time, as long as the party is not involved in an encounter. if you’re in a party with another character, you may spend your or magic instead of another party member, and may even cover the entire cost of the action for all the other party members. however, when performing their character action on their character tray, the active character must always spend at least 1 . joining an action is possible only before it begins. once the action begins, characters can no longer form or disband a party, unless specified otherwise. leaving or disbanding a party each party action needs to be taken and approved by all party members. any character not wanting to take a specific action with the rest of the party must leave the party before the action begins. you may not leave a party in the middle of an action. you may leave a party anytime it is not resolving an action. when a character in a party cannot pay the action cost required for each party member, they are dropped out of the party and the remaining characters proceed with the action. party members may only leave during combat and diplomacy if they escape from the encounter or are removed due to the effect of the you are dying card.statuses and save sheet as you travel, complete quests and solve tasks, you will be asked to mark a certain status (or a numbered part of the status) on the save sheet. statuses are story triggers, and are not personal: if there’s a status marked on a save sheet, all characters have it. encounters the green deck is mostly used in the wild and contains natural threats such as wild animals or legendary beasts. many of these encounters grant food when defeated. the gray deck contains dangers related to the world of men, such as brigands, rogue knights, or people driven to insanity. many of these encounters grant items when defeated. the purple deck contains mysterious and supernatural threats. the blue deck is a special non-combat deck. it is used mostly when you visit an unfriendly settlement and it contains dangerous situations, as well as personal and diplomatic challenges. cards in each of these decks are divided into 4 difficulty levels. drawing an encounter immediately launches you and your party into combat or diplomacy, depending on the encounter card. guardians if you fail to defeat a guardian encounter, place its card on the location where you triggered it. at the start of each day, roll a guardian die: 1. cardinal direction: move the guardian accordingly. 2. nothing: the guardian does not move. 3. discard: remove the guardian from play (return its card to the bottom of its encounter deck). if the guardian moves to an unrevealed or unconnected location, move it to the highest-numbered connected location instead. if the guardian stays in the same location and there are any characters there, immediately start the encounter (all characters present in the location must fight together). if the guardian enters a location with any character, or vice versa, immediately start the encounter. if there’s more than 1 guardian there, players may choose which encounter to trigger first. once the guardian is defeated, put its card on the bottom of its deck. if a character or a party enters a location with a guardian and an instant action , trigger the guardian encounter first and then resolve the instant action. if there are more encounters of a certain type on the board than available models, use cards to represent any excess encounters. items, equipment and secrets some item cards bear one of these keywords: weapon, armor, shield, companion, and relic . you can have any number of items, but you may never use more than 1 item or secret with a single keyword at the same time. at the start of the day , if you have several items or secrets with the same keyword, decide which you will use and turn the others facedown. do the same each time you get a new item or secret with the same keyword as another of your faceup items or secrets. items with a c are craftable items. if a crafting action or an encounter reward asks you to ‘draw a craftable item’, keep drawing cards from the item deck until you find the first item with a c. take it and shuffle the rest of the item deck. a similar process applies for drawing a ‘companion item’, ‘weapon item’ etc. characters may freely trade items when they are in the same location and they’re not involved in an action or encounter. if an item instructs you to flip the card in combat or diplomacy (to indicate it has been used), turn it facedown. at the end of your combat or diplomacy, flip the card back faceup.secrets are story related, numbered objects and powers that are never part of the standard item deck. they may never be lost or sold, unless specified otherwise, and are not affected by any rules that limit your number of items. if an effect asks you to discard item cards, omit any secrets, even if they have an item-specific keyword. players may trade secret cards between their characters whenever they are in the same location and not involved in an action. the exception are cards with the personal keyword, which may never be transferred to another character. character advancement exp can be spent at each end of the day to raise your attributes, gain additional combat or diplomacy cards, or gain skills. advancing combat or diplomacy decks pay 2 exp. take 3 cards from the top of your advancement pool, pick 1 of them, and add it to your deck. shuffle the 2 remaining cards back into your advancement pool. your combat and diplomacy decks must always contain at least 15 cards each. you can swap cards you own in and out of your deck at each end of the day . the cards that are not in your deck at the moment do not return to the advancement pool; place them next to your character tray or in the save compartment of your character. advancing attributes the cost of raising attributes depends on the total value of the attribute pair: 2 exp: 1st point in a pair of opposing attributes. 4 exp: 2nd point in a pair of opposing attributes. 6 exp: 3rd point in a pair of opposing attributes. 8 exp: 4th point in a pair of opposing attributes. 10 exp: 5th and any further points in a pair of opposing attributes. buying skills whenever you earn a 3rd (or any subsequent) point in any single attribute, attach a skill card bearing that attribute to the appropriate edge of your character tray. whenever you gain a skill, you must choose one side and forfeit the other. every skill card has a point of its attribute printed on its face. death and insanity if your falls to 0 on your health track, attach the you are dying card to your character tray, immediately escape any current encounter, and resolve all additional rules on the card. death in single player mode, the game ends when your character dies. in cooperative mode, your death does not end the game. instead, follow these steps: 1. if there’s an unclaimed character left in the box, you may claim this character, perform standard character setup, then place your model in the lowest-numbered revealed location. 2. place all the dead character’s items on the location where the character died. they may be picked up by any other players until the location disappears. 3. split all the secrets belonging to the dead character between the other characters in any way the owner of the dead character wishes. secrets with the personal keyword disappear forever when their owner is killed. if all other characters are either in use or dead when a character dies, the game ends in failure, even for characters still alive. insanity if your reaches the 2 top red slots of your track, attach the you are going insane card to your character tray and follow its rules. allmother’s mercy if you and your party perish and do not wish to start again, you may decide that the intervention of the allmother saved you. mark the status saved by the goddess on your save sheet and go to verse 500 in the book of secrets. this will restart you at the beginning of the chapter with some pre-defined resources. saving the game save your game and store it only after completing a chapter, when the journal or event card gives you such an option. however, in emergency situations, you may save the game at any time. each player saves the state of their character: 1. pick 1 character tray diagram on the save sheet. sign it with your character’s name. then use a pencil to mark your attributes, the numbers of your resources, and the state of your survival tracks on the diagram. 2. if you have any skills, write their unique numbers next to the attribute they attach to. 3. write down any additional important information, such as the state of the quest dials or secret card dials (if you have any). 4. store all markers from your character tray in the box. 5. put all your items and secrets in one of the 4 save compartments in the box. 6. stack all your diplomacy cards with all your combat cards. put the advancement pool separator cards on top of your combat and diplomacy advancement pools and stack them together. put both stacks in your save compartment. all players save the state of the world: 1. use your save sheet to note the current location of all character models, guardian models, menhir models, and special dials, as well as the current value of each dial. 2. place all models, dials and tokens in the box. 3. stack all revealed locations into a pile and place the revealed locations separator card on top of them. then, add the unrevealed locations to the pile, facing the other way. place all location cards in the oversized cards compartment of the box. ensure that any locations you’ve removed from the game are stored separately, in the other, smaller compartment. 4. store all 4 of your current encounter decks in the box, behind the saved encounters separator card. 5. store your event deck and any active quests in the box, behind the saved events separator card. 6. place any remaining cards (unused secrets, items, encounters or events) in the box. to restore a saved game, reverse this process. adding or removing players every time you set up a new game session, you may add or remove players and characters (within the 1-4 characters limit). distribute any secret cards in possession of any removed characters to characters who remain in the game. secrets should never be removed from the campaign in progress unless you are specifically asked to do so. place any fresh characters in the same location as one of the veteran characters. they are the reinforcements you receive from cuanacht and begin the game with their standard starting resources and decks."

if the character has it, take the objective token off the board and earn 1 vp. if the character doesn’t have the required skill, he can temporarily purchase it at a cost of 1 vp (the points cancel each other out).a main objective requires two different skills, but a single character may only use one skill per sequence. therefore, either two characters must work one after the other to complete a main objective in a single game turn, or a single character can work over two game turns (which need not be sequential). accomplishing the first half of a main objective scores 2 vps immediately. when the second half of the main objective is completed, score 2 more vps and remove the token from the board. in the case of main objectives, purchased skills costs 2 vps each. however at least half of every main objective must be accomplished normally, without purchasing the required skill. you cannot complete your opponent’s missions. death match mode victory conditions: the game ends once one player kills all the characters on the opposing team. token setup: shuffle all the crate tokens and place one on each action circle and objective circle, crate side up. objective circles are treated like action circles and can be searched. capture the flag mode victory conditions: the game ends once either player captures 2 enemy flags and plants them on his own entry point, or on one or both of the objective circles originally holding his own flags. token setup: each player makes a d10 setup roll. the winner (re-roll ties) chooses a main objective circle on the board, then places one of his flag tokens on it. players then alternate placing tokens. shuffle all the equipment crate tokens and place one on each action circle, crate side up. special rules: a character adjacent to an enemy flag may use an action phase to pick it up, as long as there is no enemy also adjacent to the flag. flags are treated as dets, but do not require slots to be carried and you may not pick up one of your own flags. to plant an enemy flag a character with a flag must use an action phase on a circle adjacent to an entry point or one of his team’s objective circles. domination mode victory conditions: the game ends once either player has 4 flag tokens placed on any 4 different objective circles anywhere on the board. token setup: both players place their flag tokens in front of them. shuffle all the crate tokens and place one on each action circle, crate side up. special rules: a character adjacent to an objective circle may use an action phase to place a flag token, as long as there is no enemy also adjacent to the circle. enemy flags there are removed and returned to their owner. flags cannot be exchanged, given, dropped or picked up in this mode.paths a path is identified by the color of the circles on it. some circles are made up of several colors, indicating they are part of several paths. characters see every circle on their path—neither friendly nor enemy characters block line of sight. modifier circles modifier circles on the board or tokens modify their matching characteristics when a character is on them—for every green symbol a 1 point bonus to the characteristic’s current value, and for every red symbol a 1 point penalty. in the case of movement modifiers, the penalty is the cost for the character to move off the circle. movement penalties are not cumulative; use the greatest penalty from a given source. objective circles objective circles are not part of any path. characters must stand next to them to accomplish objectives. the larger of the icons on a token is the objective category, and also indicates on which matching objective circle on the board it is placed. also, main objectives can only be placed on golden symbols and secondary objectives on silver symbols. action circles action circles are not part of any path. crate tokens are placed on them, and when a character spends an action phase adjacent to them (without doing anything else), he can search the crate. entry points circles entry points belong to paths and indicate where characters can be brought onto the board. game sequence a game is made up of game turns. each character has a sequence made up of a movement phase and an action phase. at the start of every turn each player makes a d10 initiative roll, adding +1 for every of his characters that has died. the winner decides which team goes first on that turn (re-roll ties). players alternate activating their characters one at a time, in any order. each character can only be activated once per game turn. once all surviving characters have been activated, a new turn begins with a new initiative roll. a character may complete his phases in any order, and may interrupt his movement phase to execute his action phase (in full), and then return to movement. dice all dice in a single dice pool are rolled together and any that equal or exceed the difficulty score of the action count as a success. penalties cannot be applied to natural 10 rolls nor bonuses to natural 1 rolls.movement phase an active character can move a number of circles equal to his current movement value. a character may move through allies but must end movement on an empty circle. equipment or doors do not impede movement. a character must stop adjacent to an enemy but may bull rush the enemy in the action phase to get by. it costs 1 movement point for an incoming character to move onto an entry point circle from off the board. characters cannot move onto objective or action circles or end movement on an entry point circle. action phase a character may perform only one of the following tasks during his action phase: – perform an action – bull rush an enemy – use a piece of equipment – drop, give away and/or pick up equipment– search a crate – attack an opponent or use a grenade bull rushing an opponent resolve a stamina duel with the opponent. success means your character may move through the occupied circle. failure means your character cannot move through, but can go elsewhere. if several enemy characters are standing adjacent to each other, a successful bull rush against the first enemy in the line means the character may cross all of the occupied circles (at the usual cost of 1 movement point per circle). equipment the character image or affiliation symbol on the back of an equipment token indicates which character can choose it during setup. characters can only drop, give away or pick up disposable equipment tokens (hashed border). as many dets as desired may be dropped in one phase, but they must be dropped on an adjacent free circle on the character’s path. as many dets as desired may be given away in one phase, but the receiving character(s) must be adjacent and on the same path. as many dets as desired, from different circles, may be picked up in one phase, if they are on the same or adjacent circles on the same path as the character. equipment must be placed in an empty slot. multiple tokens of the same weapon type may be stacked in the same slot. a character receiving or picking up dets may use them beginning with his next sequence. if a character dies, stack all disposable equipment tokens on the circle he was standing on. searching crates a character can only search a crate if he is adjacent to it and no enemy character is adjacent to it. flip the crate token faceup to reveal equipment or vps. equipment may also be dropped into a crate.resolving a duel to resolve a stamina or mental duel, players use the current value of their character’s appropriate character- istic. this is the number of dice in the player’s dice pool and the difficulty score that their opponents must equal or beat to mark successes against them. both players roll their dice pools, adding up the successes versus their opponent’s difficulty score. whoever rolls the greatest number of successes wins (defender wins ties). combat combat roll roll the dice in the attacker’s dice pool and count the number of successes versus the defender’s difficulty score. if there is at least one success, the defender makes a shock roll—each success cancels one hit. standard combat (anything other than h-to-h) dice pool = attacker’s current combat value. difficulty score = defender’s current combat value. hand-to-hand combat (adjacent circles on same path; must have h-to-h skill to attack) attacker has h-to-h weapon: dice pool = attacker’s current combat value. attacker doesn’t have h-to-h weapon: dice pool = attacker’s lowest combat value. defender has h-to-h weapon: difficulty score = defender’s current combat value. defender doesn‘t have h-to-h weapon: difficulty score = defender’s lowest combat value. shock roll dice pool = defender’s current stamina value. difficulty score = combat value the attacker used. wounds each hit not cancelled by the shock roll is a wound. the defender’s health indicator token is pointed one row downwards at the character’s new current values. if the token is moved below the last row, the character dies and its miniature removed. victory points a unit may spend victory points (vps) in any game mode to gain special bonuses. tokens are kept visible. before taking an action a character may use 1 or more vps, which are spent whether or not the action succeeds. during a single sequence, a hero may spend a maximum of 2 vps and a trooper 1 vp. victory points can be used to: increase a character’s movement (1 vp) +1 mp for that sequence only. launch a counterattack (1vp) if character survives attack. use lowest combat value. neither character can use vps, extra ammunition, nor can they re-counterattack. re-reroll a initiative roll (1 vp) if you rolled the lower die; once per game turn. opponent cannot re-roll. if there is then a tie, both players re-roll again.heal 1 wound (1 vp) after making a shock roll (and your character is not dead). no counterattack allowed. temporarily buy a skill (1 or 2 vps) see story mode. weapon types hand-to-hand weapons and the h-to-h skill allow a character to use their current combat value when enagaged in h-to-h combat with an adjacent target on the same path. close combat weapons have a minimum range of 2 and the target must be on the same path. automatic weapons have a minimum range of 3 and the target must be on the same path. heavy weapons have a minimum range of 4 and the target must be on the same path. characters cannot counterattack or use extra ammunition when using a heavy weapon. those who don’t have athletics skill move with their lowest movement value when carrying one. heavy weapons inflict automatic wounds applied after the shock roll that cannot be countered by it. grenades are thrown onto an empty circle a minimum of 4 spaces away and on the same path. place a debris token (1 point movement penalty) on the targeted circle, and discard the grenade token. make a separate combat roll for each character, friend or foe, standing on a circle adjacent to the blast, even if not on the same path. each of these characters also suffers an automatic wound applied after the shock roll that cannot be countered by it. a character cannot counterattack with a grenade. smoke screen grenades are thrown onto an empty circle on the same path and cannot be picked back up. place a smoke screen token on the circle and discard the ssg grenade token. the entire path immediately fills with smoke for the rest of the game. all characters on a smoke-filled path suffer a -3 penalty to their current combat and stamina values. a character standing directly on a token suffers a -5 penalty to each. penalties due to smoke can never reduce a characteristic’s current value below 1. the effects of multiple ssgs are not cumulative. each character is affected by the worst applicable smoke penalty only. hermetica place the appropriate hermetica token on an empty circle on the same path. its effects are applied immediately across the entire path. the token and its effects do not affect movement. if the character who invoked a given hermetica dies, its effects end immediately and its token is removed. only one hermetica may affect any given path at once. victory points victory pointsweapon types weapon typeshand-to-hand weapons range: adjacent on path. no htoh skill: no attack. attacker has hth weapon: dice pool current cv. attacker no hth weapon: dice pool lowest cv. defender has hth weapon: difficulty current cv. defender no hth weapon: difficulty lowest cv. close combat weapons automatic weapons heavy weapons no athletics skill: use lowest movement value. cannot counterattack or use extra ammunition. inflict automatic wounds.grenades target empty circle on path and place a debris token. combat roll for all adjacent characters even on other paths. automatic wound. cannot counterattack with grenade. smoke screen grenades smoke screen token on circle on same path;

then they get any other resources they have production of according to their player board. place all generated resources in their corresponding boxes. 3. remove player markers from used action cards, allowing them to be used again next generation.actions a. play a card from your hand 1. check the requirements to play a card you must meet its requirements (listed next to its cost) and be able to perform the effects on the card. however, you may play a card that: – raises global parameters that have already reached their goal. – adds resources that you can’t collect. – removes resources for any player if you can’t or do not wish to. even if these effects can’t be performed, you may still play the card, performing all other effects as usual. 2. paying and performing immediate effects you must pay the card’s cost. some blue cards already in play may give you a discount. you may also use steel and titanium to help pay for building and space cards respectively. then, the lower panel of the card shows you any immediate effects. these effects (and other effects triggered by the card you just played) can be performed in any order you choose. you must perform any production (brown boxes). resources or production without a red border always affect yourself. those with a red border can affect any player you choose (even yourself). cards may also feature red bordered tiles and tags, meaning any player’s tiles or tag. gain any resources immediately. a red border means you can choose the resources of any one player, but red bordered resources are optional, so you do not remove your own resources if you are the only player with those resources. non-standard resources (those not collected on your player board) are instead collected on specific cards; usually on the same card that generated them. any tiles placed by a card must be placed if possible, but being unable to do so does not prevent you from playing the card. if a card symbol has a *, it is an exception to the normal rules; read the explanation in parenthesis to see how the card works. if you are unsure of a card’s function, read the explanation text. 3. place the card events (red) are collected in a facedown personal pile after being played. their tags only apply while being played. automated cards (green) are placed faceup in a stack with only the top row visible. they have no further effect, but their tags still apply. active cards (blue) have ongoing effects that may trigger at any time, or actions that you can use. they are placed faceup in a stack with only the top row visible. b. use a standard project the 6 standard projects printed on the board are always available. each of them may be used several times during a generation. sell patents: you may discard a number of cards from your hand to gain the same number of . power plant: for 11 you can increase your energy production 1 step. asteroid: for 14 you can increase temperature 1 step (and your tr).aquifer: for 18 you can place an ocean tile (you also get 1 tr and collect any placement bonus for the tile).greenery: for 23 you can place a greenery tile, which increases oxygen level (and your tr) 1 step, and collect any placement bonus for the tile. put a player marker on the tile. city: for 25 you can place a city tile (collect any placement bonus for the tile, and place a player marker on it). you also get to increase your production 1 step.c. claim a milestone if you meet the criteria of a milestone, you may claim it by paying 8 and placing your player marker on it. a milestone may only be claimed by one player, and only 3 of the 5 milestones may be claimed in total. each claimed milestone is worth 5 vps at the end of the game. these are the milestones and what you need to claim them (besides paying 8 ): terraformer: have a terraform rating of at least 35. mayor: own at least 3 city tiles.gardener: own at least 3 greenery tiles.builder: have at least 8 building tags in play. planner: have at least 16 cards in your hand. d. fund an award there is no requirement that must be met to fund an award. the first player to fund an award pays 8 and places a player marker on it. the next player to fund an award pays 14 , and the last pays 20 . only 3 awards may be funded, and each award can only be funded once. in the final scoring, each award is checked, and 5 vps are awarded to the player who wins that category (it does not matter who funded the award). the second place gets 2 vps (except in a 2 player game where second place does not give any vps). ties are friendly: more than one player may get the first or second place bonus. if more than one player gets the 1st place bonus, no 2nd place is awarded. the awards are: landlord: own the most tiles in play. banker: have the highest production. scientist: have the most science tags in play.thermalist: have the most heat resource cubes. miner: have the most steel and titanium resource cubes. e. use the action on a blue card many blue cards and corporations have actions, indicated by a red arrow. each such action card may be used once each generation. when you use an action on a blue card, you must first pay any cost stated to the left of the arrow. you get whatever the arrow points to, and place a player marker on the card to indicate that it has been used this generation. the player markers are removed during the production phase. blue cards may also have effects that are always active. these effects are not actions (no red arrow), so you can always use them. f . convert plants into greenery 8 plant resources may be turned into a greenery tile, which increases oxygen level 1 step (and therefore also your tr 1 step). the greenery tile must be placed next to another of your tiles (if possible) and may generate placement bonuses. g. convert heat into temperature 8 heat resources may be spent to increase temperature 1 step (and therefore also your tr 1 step). player boards production tracks: if you gain production of a resource, mark the new production level with your player marker. production is not limited to 10; use 2 markers to denote higher numbers. megacredits ( ): used to pay for cards etc. production is the only production that can be negative, but never lower than -5. steel: worth 2 /cube; used to pay for cards with a building tag. you may pay with both and steel, but you get no refund for ’overpaying’ with steel.titanium: worth 3 /cube; used to pay for cards with a space tag. plants: may be converted into greenery tiles.energy: used by many cards. all leftover energy is converted into heat at the beginning of the production phase. heat: may be spent to raise temperature 1 step. tiles when placing a tile on the board, first check to see if there are any placement restrictions. there are areas reserved for ocean and specific cities where no other tiles may be placed, and each tile may have specific restrictions. when you place the tile, receive the placement bonus printed on that area (if any). you also get a bonus for placing tiles next to ocean tiles. ocean tile: ocean tiles may only be placed on areas reserved for ocean. placing an ocean tile increases your tr 1 step. ocean tiles are not owned by any player. each ocean tile on the board provides a 2 placement bonus for any player later placing a tile, even another ocean, next to it. greenery tile: if possible, greenery tiles must be placed next to another tile you own. if you have no available area next to your tiles, or if you have no tile at all, you may place the greenery tile on any available area. place a player marker on it. when placing a greenery tile, you increase the oxygen level, if possible, and also your tr. if you can’t raise the oxygen level you don’t get the increase in tr either. greenery tiles are worth 1 vp at the end of the game, and also provide 1 vp to any adjacent city. city tile: may not be placed next to another city (however noctis city must always be placed on its reserved area). place a player marker on it. each city tile is worth 1 vp for each adjacent greenery tile (regardless of owner) at the end of the game. (the card capital places the unique capital city tile, which counts and scores like a normal city tile, but additionally gives you vps for adjacent ocean tiles.) special tiles: some cards allow you to place special tiles. their function or placement restriction is described on the card. place the tile, and place a player marker on it. game end when all 3 global parameters (ocean, temperature, and oxygen) reach their goals, the game ends at the end of that generation. after the production phase, players have 1 extra chance to convert plants into greenery tiles (in player order; this may also trigger other effects such as placement bonuses). then the final scoring takes place: 1. tr: your tr at the end of the game is your basic score. move your marker onward from this point as you add vps from the rest of the scoring. 2. awards: gives the leading player in that category 5 vps and the runner-up 2 vps (except in a 2-player game). ties are friendly: players at the same level get the same vps for 1st or 2nd place. add your points to the tr-track. 3. milestones: each claimed milestone is worth 5 vps. 4. game board: players get vps from the map on the game board. each greenery tile is worth 1 vp and each city tile is worth 1 vp for each greenery adjacent to it (regardless of who owns the greenery tiles). count these in player order to avoid confusion. 5. cards: first count all vps on cards that collect resources. then gather all of your remaining cards (including all your played events) and count your vps. if you have jovian cards, these may have to be counted separately. the player with the highest total score is the winner. any ties are won by having the most ."
193,135219,THE BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES,2014,ARES GAMES,3.5918,147,"setup one player is the free peoples player (fp); the other is the shadow player (sp). both players take all their unit and character figures, the corresponding cards, and their leadership tokens. separate the fp dwarves and men, fp elves and sp recruitment tokens and shuffle them facedown into 3 piles. place starting figures and recruitment tokens as shown on the map on page 7 of the rules. draw the recruitment tokens randomly from the appropriate piles and place them without looking at them. place the 2 closed mountain pass markers between each goblin mustering point and the corresponding mountain pass box. shuffle the event deck, the 2 story decks and the fate deck. place the fate marker on step 0 of the fate track. place the bilbo, thorin, lord of the eagles and beorn figures on the steps indicated. place the standard fate tiles (light brown) in an opaque container to form the fate pool. set aside the 2 special fate tiles (blue and red). the sp takes 6 red shadow action dice and the fp takes 5 blue free peoples action dice. the game board most of the board is divided into regions. each has an icon indicating its terrain type (hills, mountains, plains, ruins, and swamps) and territory (broken lands: yellow, valley: red, eastern bank: blue, and southern spur: green). regions are divided by borders indicated by a white line. regions separated by a white line are adjacent. borders can also be outlined by the river, fords and slopes. a river border is impassable, and regions separated by it are not adjacent. combat across a river border is not allowed. a ford means the river border can be crossed and the regions on its two ends are adjacent. a slope divides a mountain region and any non-mountain region. a black line is an impassable border: armies cannot move into regions encircled by a black line or attack across black lines. a region, independently of its terrain type, may contain a settlement. eastern spur, front gate and ravenhill each contain a fortification (light brown triangle with a number). the broken lands contain 4 mustering regions (red diamond with a crown). there is no limit to the number of sp units each of these regions can hold. the special areas within the lonely mountain (each consisting of 2 red boxes) are not considered regions for movement or combat purposes. each first box (goblin mustering point) is where new goblin units are recruited. goblins must move through the second box (mountain pass) to join the battle.the game turn 1. recovery players recover action dice and draw cards. the fp player takes 5 dice (6 dice if either thorin or beorn is in play). the sp takes 6 dice (7 dice if they control 2 settlements or fortifications within the same territory). then each player draws 2 cards, one from the event deck and one from their story deck. players may hold a maximum of 6 cards and after drawing must discard facedown any in excess. 2. generals’ activation the fp selects their generals and places leadership tokens. the fp player chooses up to 3 generals among those in play and places 1 activation token on each of their reference cards. they then take leadership tokens equal to the number of generals they chose and immediately places them on the board, each with a different fp army. 3. fate the sp draws fate tiles and the fate marker advances. the sp may draw fate tiles, one after the other, up to the number of activation tokens placed by the fp player (minimum 1). after drawing each tile, the sp either stops drawing and applies the effects of the last drawn tile, or sets aside the tile and pulls another from the fate pool (up to the maximum allowed). when drawing is done, advance the fate marker to the right on the fate track as many steps as the number on the last drawn fate tile. if the tile shows the fate icon, the fp player draws a fate card and immediately applies its effects. it is discarded after use. all other tiles drawn this turn are placed back in the fate pool. if the fate marker reaches the last step of the fate track, the fp player immediately wins the game. 4. shadow leadership the sp places leadership tokens and great bats. the sp chooses how many leadership tokens and/or great bats they will have available this turn. the total sum must be equal to the number of sp action dice (6 or 7). they then place their leadership tokens and great bats on the board. each token must be placed with a different sp army. great bats may be placed in any region, thus indicating their presence in the territory containing that region. 5. action round players roll action dice, then alternate taking actions. starting with the fp player, players choose one of their rolled action dice and use one of the possible choices allowed. the fp player may use the general ability of one of their activated generals before each of their actions. when both players have used all their action dice, proceed to the next phase. 6. end of turn players check victory conditions and remove leadership tokens, eagles and great bats. remove both players’ leadership tokens and any great bats from the board. eagle figures go back to the eagles’ eyrie. removed unused activation tokens from the fp generals.action dice the total number of action dice you roll in your turn is your action dice pool. one additional die can be earned by each player during the game. the fp player earns their extra die if thorin oakenshield (or later beorn) is in play. the sp earns theirs if they control 2 settlements or fortifications within the same territory. action dice are only added to or removed from a pool at the beginning of the turn after the requirement which adds and removes them is met. when an action is completed, set aside the corresponding die for the turn. the effect of an action is never mandatory (eg, if an action allows you to ‘move 1 army and attack’, you may move only, attack only, or do both). you may pass your action if your opponent has more unused action dice. you may skip an action by discarding a die without effect. event and story cards both players draw from a shared event deck, and each player has their own story deck. each event card has an order effect, triggered using an action die during the action round, or a combat effect, applied during a combat. story cards can only be played using an action die during the action round. if the event deck runs out, shuffle all used and discarded event cards into a new deck. if a story deck runs out, no more cards may be drawn from that deck. a card can be played during the action round by using an event action die result, or by using an action die result matching the card type: army, character or muster (the icon in the upper right corner). some cards have a requirement that must be fully satisfied in order to play the card. if the effects of a card cannot be fully applied it can still be played and the effects applied as much as possible. most cards are discarded once resolved. play on the table means the card’s effects last until a condition or requirement is met, after which the card is discarded. they do not count against the maximum hand size while in play. damage dealt by event cards is applied in the same way as combat damage. fate the sp may continue to draw tiles up to the number of generals with an activation icon. the sp must always apply the effects of the last drawn fate tile. then that tile is discarded and any tile previously drawn that turn is placed back into the fate pool. if the sp draws a red or blue special tile, they must stop drawing and immediately apply its effects. the number on the fate tile is the number of spaces the fate marker moves to the right on the fate track. when the fate marker reaches or passes the space of a special character, the character is ready and may be played during the action round as indicated on its card. a fate icon on the fate tile means the fp player draws and immediately plays a fate card. place the card next to the appropriate character card whether it has entered play or not. if the character has been eliminated, discard the drawn card.characters and generals characters characters can be on the board alone (or with other characters) in a region, or moving and fighting with a friendly army. a character not with an army ignores, and is ignored by, enemy armies. a character/special unit card starts illustration faceup, and is flipped when the character/special unit enters play. characters must become ready before entering play. fp characters become ready when they fate maker reaches or passes their space on the fate track. the sp character bolg becomes ready when the sp controls at least 1 region in the valley. a ready character can enter play during the action round by using an action die of the type specified on its card. other requirements may be specified. a character cannot enter play in a specific region if that region contains enemy units or is controlled by the enemy. a character may become not ready again if the condition for being ready is no longer met and the character has not yet been brought into play. when using a character movement action, you may move any or all of your characters on the board, each up to a number of regions equal to its movement rating. a character within an army may move when that army moves, or be left behind in the army’s starting region. generals bard, thranduil, gandalf the grey, dáin ironfoot and the lord of the eagles are fp generals. each general has a special ability that can be used only when they have an activation token on their card. discard the token during the action round, before choosing action die results, to use the ability. you may only discard 1 token before using a given die. unused tokens are discarded at the end of the turn. thranduil and gandalf the grey use the range ruler: place one end entirely in the region where the attack comes from, and if the target region is touched by the opposite end, or falls within its arc, it is within range. you cannot attack from one region to another crossing the black borders on the lonely mountain. the damage from thranduil’s archery and gandalf’s blast of magic is applied in the same way as combat damage. armies a group of friendly units in the same region is an army. each unit type is described by a specific unit card. characters and leadership tokens in a region with a friendly army are part of it. the number of figures in the game is a limited to the maximum number of figures of that type that can be in play. a region can contain a maximum of 5 army units (characters, leadership tokens and special units do not count, and sp mustering regions and goblin mustering points have no limit). the leadership of an army is the sum of the leadership rating of all its characters, plus the number of leadership tokens with the army. an army with a least 1 character with a leadership of 1 or more, or at least 1 leadership token, is an ‘army with leadership’. a leadership token is immediately removed if it ever remains in a region without an army. army movement an army can be moved to an adjacent region not occupied by an enemy army with the following action die results: army: an army may make a strategic movement action (up to 2 different armies to an adjacent region), or an attack action (move 1 army to an adjacent region and then attack). character: an army with leadership may make an attack action (move 1 army to an adjacent region and then attack) or a fast movement action (1 army up to 2 regions). lidless eye: an army with at least 1 goblin unit may make a strategic movement action (up to 2 different armies containing goblins to an adjacent region or from a mustering point to a mountain pass), or an attack action (move 1 army containing goblins to an adjacent region or from a mustering point to a mountain pass and then attack). movement is never mandatory. an army may be moved more than once in a turn by spending multiple action dice. splitting and merging an army may be split into 2 by moving only some of the units. with a strategic movement action, each part may move to a different region, or it may be split into 3 parts, with 2 moving and 1 staying behind. if an army with damage tokens is split, the tokens must be split so the number remaining is not higher than the number of units in each part. if an army ends its movement in a region containing a friendly army, they must merge into a single army. if necessary reduce it to 5 units: the controlling player first removes up to 2 damage tokens for each unit eliminated, then removes any remaining units of their choice in excess of 5. during an attack, the armies merge before combat; during a strategic movement, both armies complete their moves before merging (no figure may move twice in the same action). if an army moves more than 1 region, it cannot split units during the move, and cannot merge along the way or pick up friendly units. stacking limits are checked only all the movements are complete. if the army enters a region adjacent to an enemy army it must immediately stop moving. controlling free peoples settlements when a sp army enters a region with a fp settlement/ fortification (even if it does not stop there), it controls it: place a control marker there. the marker is removed if a fp army unit (not a character or eagles) later moves into the settlement. moving into an enemy settlement is not considered an attack, even if it is controlled by the enemy. mustering armies both players may bring new units into play by using the recruitment action of a muster die to flip 1 recruitment token in each of 2 different regions. the sp may use the goblins recruitment action of a lidless eye die to place 1 goblin in each of the 2 goblin mustering point boxes. special abilities and cards may bring units directly into play. the back of a recruitment token identifies it as shadow, dwarves and men, or elves, and the front what type of unit(s) it brings into play when flipped. they are always drawn randomly from the appropriate group and placed facedown (and unseen by both players) on the board. once all from a group have been used, no more from that group can be placed. tokens can never be placed in a region with an enemy army or control marker.when you flip a token, choose a region with a token of the appropriate type and turn it faceup. replace it with unit(s) of the appropriate type (if a figure of that type is not available, you may choose any other unit from the same group) and remove the token from the game. if, during a movement or after a combat, an army enters or moves through a region with enemy recruitment tokens, the tokens are removed and reshuffled with the unused tokens of the same type. if there are more than 5 army units in a region after recruitment, the controlling player must choose those in excess to remove. mustering regions have no stacking limit. rallying armies you may rally up to 2 different friendly armies with a rally action of a muster die. for each army, roll dice equal to the number of units in it: on each 5 or 6, remove 1 damage token. you may roll again a number of failed dice up to the total leadership of the army. after the roll, you may also take casualties if you desire. mountain passes at the beginning of the game the mountain passes are closed, as indicated by the markers between each mustering point and the corresponding mountain pass. a mountain pass opens as soon as the connected mustering point contains at least 5 units. remove the marker: the pass remains open for the rest of the game. the sp army may only move from the mustering point to the mountain pass when it is open (using normal army movement). it may then move only to the region connected to the mountain pass; and may attack a fp army as normal if a fp army is there. the attack is not considered to cross a slope border. sp armies in the mountain pass and a normal region cannot combine attacks. units in any region cannot enter, retreat into, or attack units in a mountain pass, and it is not considered adjacent to a region. event cards that allow recruitment in regions containing armies may be used in goblin mustering point and mountain passes. combat an army may attack an adjacent region occupied by an enemy army by using the attack action of an army die after moving their army; by using the combined attack action of an army die and attacking a region with other friendly armies adjacent to that region; or by using the attack action of a character die after moving their army with leadership. a sp army with at least 1 goblin unit may also use the attack action of a lidless eye die after moving their army. the army of the active player is the attacker, and the army of the other player is the defender. before starting a combat, check the terrain type of the defender’s region. the army with the highest number of units that have that type as one of their favored terrains has terrain superiority and immediately draws 1 event card and adds it to their hand (discard to 6 if necessary). on a tie neither player draws a card. each player then prepares their card hand by setting aside any story cards, and adding to their hand the unit cards of each unit type in their army, their regroup card, and any special maneuver cards if applicable (from thorin oakenshield and great bats). these cards do not count against the hand limit.combat sequence combats are resolved in a series of simultaneous rounds, each of which is divided into the following steps: 1. maneuvering players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand. you may either play a unit card (to use that unit type’s maneuver ability), an event card (to use its combat effect), a special maneuver card, or the regroup card. the combat effect of an event card is applied when specified by the text. if 2 cards apply at the same time, apply the defender’s first. event cards are discarded from play after use. special maneuver cards are applied immediately, independent of the dice roll. thorin’s mighty strokes is not available again until a regroup card is played. vampire-like can be used every round there are great bats in the territory where the combat takes place. unit cards are left faceup on the table. when a regroup card is played, return all unit and special maneuver cards you have played this combat to your hand. 2. the combat roll each player rolls dice equal to the sum of the combat ratings of all the units in their army, up to a maximum of 5 dice. if you played a unit card during the previous step, first substitute a number of white dice with black dice equal to the number of units of the selected type. after the combat roll and leader re-roll, if at least 1 of the black dice scored a hit, you may use the special ability of that unit type. if necessary the attacker declares first if they want to use a maneuver ability. any hits rolled on white or black dice are applied normally. a hit is scored for each result that equals or beats a target number (usually 5). other target numbers are as follows: attacking a defender in a fortification: 6 until the fortification is broken. attacking a defender across a ford: 6 on the first round only. attacking a defender in a mountains region across a slope: 6 on the first round only. cards and special abilities may modify the target number. a card that adds or subtracts from a combat roll modifies each die result produced by the roll. no modification may lower the target number below 2 or increase it to above 6. 3. leader re-roll an army with leadership may re-roll a number of dice that missed equal to the army’s total leadership (white or black dice). the new result is final. 4. apply damage add a damage token to an army for each hit on it. event cards and abilities that affect damage are determined after taking damage tokens and before taking casualties. when taking casualties, for each unit you choose to eliminate from your army, you may remove up to 2 damage tokens. eliminated units may be mustered again. when the number of damage tokens on a army exceeds its number of units, you must take casualties and remove units (remove 2 damage tokens for each unit removed) until the number of tokens is equal to or lower than the number of units. if all units in an army are eliminated, so are all characters and leadership tokens in the army. eliminated characters are permanently out of the game.5. end of round the combat ends if either side is eliminated. after the round, if the attacker declares wants to withdraw, the combat ends. if they do not, the defender may retreat (if they played a regroup card this round) or rout (if they did not play a regroup card). if the defender is eliminated, retreats, or routs, the attacker may advance. if both sides are eliminated, the defender retains control of the contested region. fortifications eastern spur, front gate and ravenhill are fortifications. if a defending army is attacked while within a fortification, damage to it is applied to the fortification until the damage tokens reach its fortification value and it is broken. further damage is inflicted on the defender and the target number reverts to 5 on the following round. damage to a fortification is permanent. when an ability cancels or prevents damage, it may be used to cancel or prevent fortification damage. retreating & routing an army retreats when the defender played the regroup card and decides to end the combat at the end of a round. a defending army may move to an adjacent region if the region does not contain an enemy army or an enemy-controlled settlement; if it is not adjacent to a region with an enemy army (including the attacker); and if the region is not across a ford. it may always retreat to an adjacent region if that region contains a friendly army, or a settlement controlled by the retreating player. if these conditions cannot be satisfied, the attacker chooses an adjacent region (which does not contain one of the attacker’s armies or attacker-controlled settlements) and the retreating army suffers 1 additional damage. if there is no viable region, the retreat is not allowed. an army routs when the defender did not play the regroup card and decides to end the combat at the end of a round. the army takes casualties and loses units until the number of damage counters is reduced to 1 or 0. it then moves to an adjacent region in the same way as a retreating army. an attacker may advance into the now-empty region if a defender retreats, routs or is eliminated. they may split their army and advance with only some units (if necessary, splitting damage tokens as normal). combined attacks more than 1 army adjacent to the attacked region may combine attacks by using the combined attack action of an army die. at the start of each round the attacker chooses which adjacent army will fight in the current round. only that army’s characteristics are relevant, and all hits scored by the defender are taken by that army. terrain superiority is checked only once before the first combat round and the target number of each army is affected by a ford or slope only the first time it attacks. the attacker always recovers any used unit and special maneuver card when they switch the attack to a different army. after a victorious combined attack, the attacker may advance only one (or part of one) army. if the last attacking army is eliminated and the defender is eliminated, retreats, or routs, the combat is still won by the attacker if an army survives and one of the attacking armies my advance."
196,172047,THE OTHERS: 7 SINS,2016,COOL MINI OR NOT,3.027,111,"setup one player is the sins player and the rest are hero players. the sins player plays against all the hero players, who cooperate. the sins player chooses or randomly determines a single sin. take the corresponding sin board, and place the apocalypse track (with a tentacle marker on the 0 slot) next to it. shuffle your corresponding sin deck and place it facedown near you. take all of your sin’s monster figures (1 avatar, 1 controller with a black base, and 6 abominations). choose or randomly determine a single type of acolyte to use. place the corresponding acolyte board next to the sin board, and take all 6 of the chosen acolyte monster figures. all the players choose or randomly determine a story board. terror stories focus on combat and action. corruption stories focus on the heroes’ struggle to resist corruption and rid the city of it. redemption stories focus on saving the city from various crises, and specific missions. shuffle the apocalypse deck corresponding to the chosen story type and place it facedown near the sins player. place the chosen story board close to a hero player chosen to keep track of it, and put 1 tentacle marker on the slot for the first mission, and another on the 0 slot of the mission progress track. all the players choose or randomly determine which map setup on the back of the chosen story board to use. take the listed game tiles and position them as shown. place the indicated number of tokens and monster figures in the spaces shown. there may also be specific setup instructions to follow. the hero players always have a full team of 7 f.a.i.t.h. agents available, but there are always 3 or 4 heroes in play, as follows: 1 hero player: controls 3 heroes (3 heroes in play) 2 hero players: each controls 2 heroes (4 heroes in play)3 hero players: each controls 1 hero (3 heroes in play) 4 hero players: each controls 1 hero (4 heroes in play) hero players choose or randomly determine the hero(es) with whom they want to start the game. remaining heroes in the team and their dashboards are kept aside as the hero reserve. attach each hero figure to the colored base corresponding to its class. a f.a.i.t.h. team always has 7 heroes, made up of 1 leader (yellow), 2 fixers (green), 2 shooters (blue), and 2 bruisers (red). place the starting hero figures in the space on the board with the starting space token. take the hero dashboard(s) belonging to your starting hero(es), and place a tentacle marker on the 1 slot of the corruption track. each hero also starts with 5 wound tokens, 2 turn tokens (active side up), and 1 city action token. shuffle the upgrade deck, place it facedown next to the board, draw 5 cards, and place them faceup and side by side next to the board as the upgrade inventory. the sins player draws his starting hand of 5 sin cards, and places next to the sin board, active side faceup, a number of reaction tokens equal to the number of heroes in play. if the hero players ever need to collectively decide something and they cannot come to a unanimous decision, the sins player decides for them.game turn start of round beginning of round story tasks the story board lists any specific task(s) that need to be executed at the beginning of every round. decide the first hero the hero players collectively decide which hero will be the first to take his turn this round. hero turns each hero has 2 turn tokens, and therefore takes at least 2 turns each round. heroes take 1 turn at a time, starting with the hero chosen to go first, and proceeding in clockwise order. at any point during a hero’s turn, if he is in a space with facedown exploration tokens and there are no monsters in that space, he may choose to flip all those tokens faceup. their effects are then active. spend a turn token flip 1 of the current hero’s turn tokens from its active side to its spent side, so the hero can take his turn. if a hero has any extra turn tokens, he can choose to discard one, instead of flipping a turn token, in order to take a turn. unused extra turn tokens remain with the hero from round to round and can be spent whenever is convenient. heroes can only take a single turn at a time, with play then passing to the next hero in clockwise order. if both of a hero’s turn tokens are spent and they have no extra turn tokens to discard, they cannot take a turn. if a hero still has any active turn tokens available, he must flip one and take a turn, even if he decides to do nothing. move and take an action the current hero can move and take an action, or take an action and move. the move cannot be interrupted by the action and then resumed afterwards. the entirety of the move must be resolved either before or after taking the action. move the current hero may move up to 2 spaces across the board. take an action either before or after moving, the current hero can take 1 action to either start a fight or cleanse an area. each turn, the hero can only perform a single one of these, or he may also choose to do nothing with his action. start a fight when the current hero starts a fight, he engages in combat with all the monsters in a single space. cleanse an area when the current hero cleanses and area, he attempts to remove any of the round exploration tokens from his space (eg, corruption, fire, pentagram, and nest tokens). permanent tokens printed on the tiles can never be removed. roll a number of hero dice equal to the hero’s skill stat. each other hero sharing the same space grants +1 die to this roll. the hero may choose to take corruption to boost this roll. for each rolled, the hero may choose and remove 1 faceup exploration token from his space. any other results rolled have no effect, though still allows an extra die to be rolled and can be turned into a .city actions at any point during his turn (even between moves), the current hero may use the city actions on the district space (city block) he occupies. this does not count as the single action he can perform each turn, and can be performed even if there are monsters in the district. to perform city actions, place the hero’s city action token in the city action slot of the district he occupies. each hero has a single city action token, so will only be able to do this once per round; and each district has only 1 city action slot, so no other heroes can use that district’s city action until the next round. placing the token activates all of that district’s visible city actions. the hero executes all of the actions, one at a time, in any order he chooses. if there are multiples of the same type of city action shown, execute that action multiple times. heal: the current hero may remove 1 wound token from his dashboard. repent: the current hero may move the tentacle marker on his corruption track down 1 level. extra turn: the current hero may take 1 extra turn token and place it next to his dashboard. inventory: the current hero may take 1 upgrade card from the upgrade inventory and place it next to his dashboard. immediately draw a new card from the upgrade deck and add it to the upgrade inventory. there is no limit to the number of upgrade cards each hero may have, and all of their abilities are always in effect. orbital strike: the current hero moves 1 orbital strike token of his choice up to 2 spaces away. he may then automatically kill 1 acolyte or abomination standing in the same space as the orbital strike token (this is not a fight). the orbital strike token moves following the normal movement rules, though it ignores all tokens and figures, cannot use the metro to move between spaces, and cannot cross empty spaces between separate tiles. sin reactions after each hero finishes his turn, the sins player can choose to spend a reaction token or not. if he doesn’t want to react to the current hero, play continues to the next hero in clockwise order. if he does, the sins player flips 1 of his reaction tokens from its active side to its spent side. the sins player can only perform a single reaction at a time, and only against the hero who just finished taking his turn. if a hero is killed during his turn, he did not get to finish his turn, so the sins player cannot react to it. if all of the sins player’s reaction tokens are spent, he can no longer react for this round, and the heroes just continue taking turns in sequence. the sins player can also play a single sin card from his hand during each turn (ie, a hero’s turn and the sin’s reaction to it). he can continue doing this even if his reaction tokens are spent. move a monster when the sins player reacts, he can choose 1 monster on the board to move up to 2 spaces. start a fight with the current hero the sins player may then start a fight with the hero who just finished his turn. this fight is only between the current hero and the monsters in his space. the monster that just moved does not have to be part of this fight. the sins player cannot start a fight against any other hero apart from the current hero.end of the round the round ends when all heroes have spent all their turn tokens, and nobody wishes to spend any remaining extra turn tokens. if the sins player still has any active reaction tokens he may react to the last hero turn taken. however, if he still has any active reaction tokens left after that, they can’t be spent this round and are wasted. end of round story tasks the story board lists any specific task(s) that need to be executed at the end of every round. summon monsters the sins player takes a number of dead monsters equal to the number of heroes in play and places them back on the board. if there are more dead monsters than the hero number, the sins player must choose which ones he wants to summon. only monsters that were killed may be summoned, not monsters that have not yet entered play (keep ‘dead’ monsters separate from those that haven’t entered play yet). monsters are summoned onto unblocked nest tokens (permanent or physical tokens). each nest token is blocked by a single monster figure in the same space; hero figures do not block nests. if there are no more unblocked nests available, the sins player is unable to summon any remaining monsters. draw extra sin cards the sins player draws 1 extra sin card for each space containing an altar token, as long as there are no heroes in the same space. these new cards are added to his hand and may be used in future rounds. reset tokens each hero flips both of his turn tokens back to their active side. if he saved any extra turn tokens, keep them to spend in the next rounds. heroes also take back their city action token from the board and place it next to their dashboards. the sins player flips his reaction tokens back to their active side. any extra reaction tokens he might have gained during the previous round must be discarded, unless the effect that granted them is ongoing. remove any marked token from the acolyte board, as well as any other marks that last only for 1 round. rolling dice take the indicated number of the appropriate type of dice (hero dice for the hero player, sin dice for the sins player) and roll them. each result has a different effect: sin dice corruption: the targeted hero takes 1 corruption. hit: the targeted hero takes 1 wound. hit with burst: counts as a hit, but also immediately roll an extra die. if that die is also a , roll an extra die, etc. blank: no effect hero dice hit: 1 hit is scored against the targeted monsters. counter corruption: cancel 1 obtained by the sins player. defense: cancel 1 obtained by the sins player. skill: remove 1 exploration token from your space. faith: immediately roll an extra die. if that die is also a , roll an extra die, etc. after all dice have been rolled, the hero can turn each into any other result of his choice.teamwork when a hero makes any kind of dice roll, he gets a +1 die bonus for each other hero in their space. corruption when a hero makes any kind of dice roll, he may first choose to take corruption in order to boost his roll. movement the board is divided into spaces: each city block is a district space, and streets are divided by crosswalks into single spaces. figures may only move between adjacent spaces (spaces that share an edge). a tile or group of tiles separate from other tiles is not adjacent, and heroes must use the metro to cross to them. heroes can move from a space containing a metro token to another space containing a metro token of the same color as if they were adjacent spaces. monsters cannot use the metro. a teleporting figure ignores all movement-related rules: heroes ignore tokens and monsters; monsters ignore heroes. when a hero moves out of a space containing any number of monsters, he automatically takes 1 wound. the sins player cannot move a monster out of a hero-occupied space for any reason, not even to retaliate after a distant hero performs a ranged attack against the monster’s space. fire and corruption tokens when a hero moves in or out of a space containing fire or corruption tokens, the sins player makes an appropriate check. the sins player should make separate checks each time the hero leaves a space and enters a space, even in a single move. monsters are unaffected by fire and corruption tokens. fire check: the sins player rolls a number of sin dice equal to the number of fire tokens in the space being left or entered (permanent and physical tokens). for each , the hero takes 1 wound which cannot be cancelled by the hero’s defense. still cause an extra die to be rolled. have no effect. corruption check: the sins player rolls a number of sin dice equal to the number of corruption tokens in the space being left or entered (permanent and physical tokens). for each , the hero takes 1 corruption. have no effect, though still cause an extra die to be rolled. fight when a hero starts a fight, he does so against all monsters in his space, not a specific monster. when the sins player starts a fight, he does so with all monsters in a space against only the current hero. hero preparation 1. the current hero takes a number of hero dice equal to his fight stat. 2. add +1 die for each other hero in your space. 3. if the hero has the commissioner token, add +1 die. 4. add any other extra dice you may get from the hero’s natural ability or upgrade cards. 5. if you choose to take corruption, add any extra dice the hero’s corruption track might offer. sin preparation 1. the sins player adds together the fight stats of all the monsters in the space where the fight is taking place and takes that number of sin dice. 2. add +1 dice for each pentagram in the space. 3. you may choose to play a start of a fight sin card if able. 4. add any other extra dice granted by active apocalypse cards, a played sin card, the apocalypse track, or the sin’s power.fight resolution both players roll their dice simultaneously, resolving any extra die rolls and special results. the hero adds to his roll any extra results granted by his base defense, ability, upgrade cards, or – if he took voluntary corruption – from his corruption track. the sins player adds to his roll any extra results granted by active apocalypse cards, a played sin card, or the sin’s power. some results cancel each other out: each of the hero’s cancels one of the sin’s . each of the hero’s cancels one of the sin’s . results have no effect during a fight. any remaining results affect the opposing side: effect on the hero: for each remaining on the sin roll, the current hero takes 1 wound. for each remaining on the sin roll, the current hero takes 1 corruption.effects on the monsters: each monster type has a different defense rating (possibly improved by cards or other effects). to kill a monster, the hero must inflict upon it a number of hits equal to its defense. inflicting less than this has no effect; hits don’t carry over to the next fight. the hero player adds together all his results and distributes them among the monsters involved in the fight in any way he wishes. a monster that suffers a number of hits equal to its defense is removed from the board, normally to a ‘dead’ monsters area from where it may be re-summoned at the end of the round; but a card may specifically state it should be removed from the game. ranged fight if a hero has the ranged ability (naturally, or from an upgrade card), he may start a fight against the monsters in a distant space. the hero must have line of sight (los) to the targeted space. the border between indoor districts and outdoor street spaces blocks los, so ranged fights cannot occur if the hero is inside a district, or targeting monsters inside a district. you can target any street space in a straight line, no matter how far away it is. figures in the spaces between the hero and the targeted space do not affect los. los cannot go around corners, or through districts or empty spaces between tiles. resolve a ranged fight like a normal fight, with these differences: 1. the hero rolls first and applies his results. if any monsters are killed, they are immediately removed from the board. 2. if any monsters in the targeted space survived, they move up to 2 spaces towards the hero. normal movement rules apply, so they cannot leave a space occupied by a hero. if the monsters are unable to reach the space occupied by the current hero, they do not move at all. 3. if these surviving monsters are able to reach the space with the current hero, the sins player makes his fight roll with the monsters currently in the hero’s space (including any there already). resolve this roll’s effects against the hero’s initial roll. taking wounds and hero death a hero who takes 5 wounds is immediately killed. for each wound a hero takes, the hero player must place one of his wound markers on one of the bonus slots of his corruption track. this hides that bonus, making it no longer available when that hero takes voluntary corruption. the hero player can choose any of the bonus slots to place each wound marker on; it doesn’t need to follow any order. once a wound marker is placed, it cannot be moved to a different bonus slot. when the hero heals a wound, he can remove any wound marker he chooses.hero death when a hero is killed, if it is his turn, his turn ends prematurely. the hero’s figure and dashboard are removed from the game. his extra turn tokens and marked tokens are discarded, and any npc or innocent tokens in his possession are placed on the board in the space where he died. the hero’s upgrade cards are added to the general upgrade inventory, faceup next to the 5 cards there. the hero’s turn tokens and city action token are inherited by the new replacement hero. spent turn tokens remain spent, and active turn tokens remain active. the hero player chooses a hero in the hero reserve, places its figure in the starting space and takes its dashboard. place a tentacle marker on the first corruption slot, and 5 wound markers placed next to the dashboard. choose from all the cards in the upgrade inventory the same number of upgrade cards as the previous hero discarded. the common upgrade inventory should end up with 5 cards. the new hero takes the place of the old one in the turn order, and will be able to use on the same round the inherited turn tokens and city action tokens, if they are available. corruption the tentacle marker on a hero’s dashboard corruption track marks the hero’s corruption level throughout the game. forced corruption a hero takes forced corruption as a result of the sin’s actions: from a corruption check, as the outcome of a fight, or as the result of a sin card, sin power, or a story effect. each time a hero takes 1 corruption, raise his corruption level by moving his tentacle marker 1 slot to the right on his corruption track. this grants no benefits to the hero. voluntary corruption whenever a hero is about to make a dice roll, whether to fight or to cleanse an area, he may choose to take 1 voluntary corruption to get the bonuses granted by his corruption track. the hero must always choose whether to take corruption or not before any dice are rolled. if he decides to take corruption, raise his corruption level by 1. heroes can only take 1 voluntary corruption before each dice roll, no more. when a hero takes corruption this way, and only then, he adds to his current roll all the bonuses visible on his corruption track, under the corruption level he just reached and all levels before (to the left of) that. these bonuses only apply for the dice roll performed immediately upon taking the voluntary corruption. in subsequent rolls the hero gains no bonuses from his corruption track whatsoever, unless he takes voluntary corruption again. also, if he takes voluntary corruption in a fight, and, as a result of the sin’s roll, he also takes some forced corruption, his roll won’t benefit from the bonuses related to the extra corruption levels reached through the forced corruption. before the dice are rolled, a hero can always change his mind on whether he wants to take corruption or not, depending on variants the sins player may introduce to the fight. maximum corruption once a hero’s corruption level is at 7, it cannot be raised further, and each time he would take 1 forced corruption, he takes 1 wound instead. a hero at maximum corruption is unable to take voluntary corruption again, unless he first lowers his corruption. a hero reaching maximum corruption automatically kills any innocent tokens in his possession (remove them from the game). in corruption story games, at the end of a hero’s turn, if he is at maximum corruption, he must reveal his dark past card and execute any effect described on it; then discard the card.acolyte abilities each acolyte type has a different ability that the sins player can use once per round, and only when a non-ranged fight is about to be rolled. if he wishes to use the acolyte ability, the sins player places a marked token on the acolyte board. if there’s already one there, the ability can no longer be used this round. if there are no dead acolytes available, the ability cannot be used. cards upgrade cards when a hero gets an upgrade card, it is placed next to his dashboard and is then considered to be always in effect. upgrade cards cannot be traded between heroes. if a hero ever loses an upgrade card, it is placed at the bottom of the upgrade deck. apocalypse track and cards whenever the apocalypse level is raised, move the tentacle marker down to the next slot and follow the instructions next to the new level. the effects of the track are cumulative. at level 7, the apocalypse level can’t be raised anymore. when the track indicates that an apocalypse card must be revealed, the sins player draws 2 cards from the top of the appropriate apocalypse deck, chooses one to place faceup on the table, and returns the other card to the bottom of the deck. the effects described in the revealed card are now active for the rest of the game (unless stated otherwise). dark past cards during a corruption story’s setup, the sins player takes the dark past cards numbered 1, 3, and 5 (and card 6 in 4 hero game) and secretly assigns 1 card to each starting hero. he then assigns the remaining dark past cards to each of the heroes in the hero reserve. heroes keep their card facedown next to their dashboard and cannot look at them. if a hero is killed without revealing their dark past, leave it facedown with the dead hero. missions at the start of the game, the heroes must accomplish mission 1. once done, they move to mission 2, and so on, until they fulfill the last mission and win the game. the mission progress track marks the progress of the heroes. once the tentacle marker reaches the number required by the current mission, the mission is accomplished; immediately move the marker to the next mission (now the current mission). any task accomplished only counts towards the current mission. when a mission branches into 2 different options, the hero players must unanimously decide which to take. this becomes the current mission and the other option is permanently out of the game. there may be special events marked in the path between missions, which must be performed after the previous mission is accomplished but before moving on to the next mission. if an event calls for a monster to be summoned onto the board, follow the normal summoning rules. however, in this case, if all nest tokens are blocked by monsters, the new figure is placed on any nest token on the board. victory and defeat the hero players need to accomplish each of the missions on the story board in order. immediately upon accomplishing the last mission, they are declared the winners and the sin is defeated. whenever a hero is killed, its controlling player replaces that hero with one of the remaining heroes from the hero reserve. the sins player is victorious when a hero is killed and there is none left in the reserve to replace them. all the heroes don’t have to be killed, just enough so a killed hero can no longer be replaced. if both victory conditions take place at the same time, the hero players win."

side corresponding to the number of players faceup. fill the pantry spaces with 16 food tokens. place the kennel location card on the kennel location, then shuffle the rest of the location cards to form a facedown deck. reveal the first card and place the leader token in the indicated location, then shuffle the card back into the deck. place 1 damage counter on the snow cat/shed, and a number of damage counters on the base helicopter equal to the number of player minus 2. place a number of damage counters in the radio room equal to the number of players, covering the appropriate spaces. place the rest of the damage counters in the operations room. create the weapon deck using the following cards, then shuffle it and place it facedown in the armory: 4-5 players: 3 dynamite/molotov, 1 firearm, 1 flamethrower, and 3 melee weapons. 6-7 players: 3 dynamite/molotov, 2 firearms, 1 flamethrower, and 4 melee weapons. 8 players: 4 dynamite/molotov, 2 firearms, 2 flamethrower, and 4 melee weapons. create the item deck using the following cards, then shuffle it and place it facedown in the warehouse: 4-5 players: 2 flashlights, 2 fuel, 2 keys, 2 tools, and 1 wire. 6 players: 3 flashlights, 2 fuel, 2 keys, 2 tools, and 1 wire. 7 players: 3 flashlights, 3 fuel, 2 keys, 3 tools, and 2 wire. 8 players: 3 flashlights, 4 fuel, 2 keys, 4 tools, and 2 wire. fill the generator room and boiler room tracks with fuel tokens (4 each), on the spaces marked . place 1 fuel token on the rescue helicopter track in the full tank space (furthest to the left). place a number of fuel tokens in the underground warehouse (next to the boiler room) according to the number of players: up to 5 players: 10 tokens. 6 players: 14 tokens. 7-8 players: 18 tokens. place a number of fuel tokens in the external reserve (the yellow area between the base helicopter and the shed/snow cat) equal to the number of player minus 1. put 2 blood bag tokens and 3 failure lab tokens in the pink laboratory bag for each player. shuffle the deck of action cards and place it facedown near the board. each player takes the components of their chosen color (1 suspicion disk, 3 contagion tokens, and 2 role cards), and 2 action cards randomly drawn from the action deck. place your suspicion disk on the yellow space of the suspicion track. each player chooses (or distribute randomly) 1 character sheet. put your standee/miniature in the plastic base of your color. place all characters in the leisure room.take 1 alien infection token and as many dog infection tokens as there are players minus 1, mix them up, and give 1 to each player randomly. the player who gets the alien token is the alien player at the start of the game. do not reveal whether you are human or alien! each player takes the role card that matches their role (human or alien) and tucks it facedown under their character sheet. finally, put all 7 dog infection tokens and 2 alien infection tokens into the green contagion bag. place the rescue helicopter on the helicopter icon on the sos track. place the power failure token, the freezing tile, the freezing marker, the alien strength tokens, the alien standees/miniatures, the dog miniatures, the flamethrower reload tokens, the fire tokens, and the weather die next to the board in the reserve. the alien standees/miniatures represent a value of 1, 2, 3, or 4 strength and are considered alien strength tokens. they may be exchanged at any time for tokens of equal total value. the player who most recently watched the thing is the first player and takes the leader sheet with +1 on it. game phases 1. weather conditions the leader rolls the weather die and places it result side up on the matching symbol on the weather table. if the die is in the weather station, the leader may keep the result they just rolled, or use the result that was showing before they rolled. 2. base maintenance and rescue helicopter advancement according to the results on the weather table, the base must consume fuel tokens in the generator room and the boiler room. if there not enough to satisfy requirements, discard all the fuel tokens in the location, then that location receives damage counters equal to the difference (up to the maximum number possible on its track). boiler room: if there are 3 damage counters here during this check, place the freezing tile on the location, with the freezing marker at the start of the track. from now on, the freezing marker is updated according to the row of the weather table that depicts the broken boiler (instead of consuming fuel tokens according to the row with the working boiler icon). if the marker reaches the end of this track, the humans freeze and the alien wins the game. generator room: if there are 2 damage counters here during this check, place the power fail token in the location. darkness rules are now applied during the draw character cards & take character actions phase. when the generator is broken, it does not consume fuel tokens. the power fail token can be removed as soon as a player removes at least 1 damage counter from this room. rescue helicopter: if the sos has been sent from the radio room, move the fuel token on the helicopter track down 1 space, and advance the rescue helicopter on the rescue track according to the weather conditions on the weather table. if the rescue helicopter has already arrived (reached the last space of the track), just move the fuel token 1 space. if the fuel token was already on the last space, the helicopter departs, abandoning all players in the base.3. alien actions this phase takes place only if the alien player has voluntarily revealed themselves or has been exposed by a test. the alien player chooses 1 or more cards from the location deck and places them facedown in front of them. for each card played, they must decide how many alien strength tokens (and/or standees/miniatures) to place on it (a minimum of 1 each). the total point value of these tokens on a location card determines the alien’s strength in that location. the cards are only revealed after all players have placed their characters and handed their action cards to the leader in phase 4. 4. draw character cards and take character actions starting with the leader, each character draws action cards to bring them to their maximum hand limit (normally 3 cards). if a card must be drawn and there are none left, shuffle the discards to form a new deck. if you already hold the maximum number of cards, do not draw any new ones. then the leader draws 1 additional action card and places it facedown on the leader sheet without looking at it. there are 3 types of action cards: use (activates the function of the location); repair (removes a damage counter), and sabotage (places a damage counter in the location, if not fully damaged, or performs the damage action at that location). 1. character movement & action planning starting with the player to the left of the leader, each player must carry out one of these options: place your character in a location and hand over an action card: place your character in the desired location, choose 1 action card from your hand, and place it facedown on the leader sheet. these cards form the leader stack. if your suspicion disk is in the red, you must reveal any action cards you play. players cannot tell anyone which cards are in their hand or which they are playing. a maximum of 3 characters may be in each green location. if the leader token is in the chosen location, pick it up and place it in front of you for the next round. special action: if you do not have the right cards to perform an action but do not want to lose a turn to change cards, you may move your character to the desired location and discard all your action cards. then draw 1 card from the action card deck, look at it, and place it facedown on the leader stack. darkness: the players do not get to choose which action card they place in front of the leader. instead, the player to the left draws 1 card randomly from your hand and places it in front of the leader without looking at it. change cards: if you’re not happy with the cards in your hand, you may lay your character down in the dormitory (you will perform no more actions for the rest of the round), discard your entire hand of action cards, and choose an equal number of cards from the action card deck. then, shuffle the action card deck together with its discard pile to create a new deck. encounters after all players have taken their turn, an encounter occurs in any location where there are multiple beings (more than 1 character, or 1 character and any dogs and/or exposed aliens). 1. if the alien has been exposed, they reveal their location cards and place the related alien strength tokens in the corresponding location(s). if the alien is alone in a location, they can sabotage it, inflicting damage as indicated in each location’s profile. if there are other characters or dogs in that location, an encounter is resolved.2. once all situations with exposed aliens have been resolved, a character with a weapon (firearm, flamethrower, or melee weapon) may choose to use it to avoid an encounter involving themselves (if there is more than 1 other being there, an encounter still occurs without that character). players then resolve all remaining encounters, one location at a time, in an order chosen by the leader. contagion check when an encounter occurs between 2 or more characters or between 1 character and a dog, each player involved secretly looks at 1 of the 2 contagion tokens of one other character in the encounter (or 1 infection token from the contagion bag when encountering a dog), then returns it to its owner (or the bag) and advances their own suspicion disk 1 space on the suspicion track. if there are more than 2 players in an encounter, each of them must simultaneously take 1 contagion token from only one other player of their choice. they must then pick up all their role cards (whether infected or not), mix them, secretly look at them, and place the card matching their new role under their character sheet. 2. execute character actions all encounters must be resolved before the cards in the active stack are assigned by the leader. the leader shuffles the cards in the action stack. then they must turn over and play at least 1 action card from the stack. they must assign the effect of that card to any 1 character still standing in any location where the action on the card can be taken. after the action has been performed, lay the chosen character down; they cannot be assigned any more cards this round. if a character is assigned a use or repair action in a location with a cooperation bonus , and there is more than 1 standing character in that location, they repeat the action as many times as there are standing characters there. then, lay down only the one character to whom the action was assigned, to show the action has been performed. if there are no available characters that can perform the action, that action is lost, but a character in the base must still be chosen by the leader to lie down. after each action card is completed, the leader may choose to reveal another card, or stop and discard the rest of them facedown in the discard pile without looking at them. the leader always has the last word on which character will be assigned and whether to stop revealing cards. 5. leisure room and accusations all players (except for exposed aliens) return their characters to the leisure room. players may exchange weapon and/or item cards (and lab tokens, without revealing them) with each other, and may accuse another player of being an alien. after discussion and the exchange of accusations, the leader counts to 3, then each player points their finger at another player they suspect of being an alien. players who don’t wish to vote should cross their arms. players whose suspicion disks are in the green area cannot be voted against. starting with the leader, move each player’s suspicion disk forward 1 space on the suspicion track for each player who voted for them. an infected player may choose to voluntarily reveal themselves at this time. from now on, they play as an exposed alien.6. tests each player with a blood bag token and/or a wire and a flamethrower is eligible to perform up to 1 test per type (even on different characters). you can also perform a test on yourself to reveal your role to other characters. the entire group may perform 1 test a and 1 test b per round. the leader decides which of the eligible players perform tests. test a: a player with a blood bag token may perform a single test a on the character with the highest level of suspicion on the suspicion track (on a tie, the owner of the blood bag token chooses whom to test). show and discard the blood bag token and indicate the character you are testing. test b: a player who owns both a wire and a flamethrower may perform a single test b on any character, by discarding 1 reload token and indicate the character you are testing. in both cases, the chosen character must show everyone their current role card. if they are human, move their suspicion disc to the green area of the track. if they are alien, they immediately transform and begin playing as an exposed alien. exposing yourself as an alien when an alien is exposed, they must remove their character from the game, discard their cards to their respective decks, and discard all their tokens (lab tokens facedown). if they are the leader, they pass the leader sheet to the player on their left. if they are the first to become an exposed alien, they take the location deck, and alien strength tokens with a total value equal to half the number of players in the game, rounded down. otherwise, they add a 1 point alien strength token to the current alien’s pool. from now on, all exposed alien players work together, sharing the alien strength tokens and all choices and actions. 7 . food consumption if there are any supplies in the kitchen, discard them all. if there are none, 4 food tokens must be discarded directly from the pantry. if there is not enough food, all characters become hungry, and their players’ maximum hand limit is immediately reduced to 2 cards (discarding 1 of their choice if necessary). 8. dog movement and leader change the leader takes all the dogs that are not in the kennel, shuffles the location deck, then reveals a number of cards equal to the number of dogs not in the kennel. for each card, place 1 dog in the corresponding location. if at any point the kennel card is drawn, the kennel is unlocked. the leader must continue drawing cards and placing dogs until all of them have been placed in locations (draw another card to determine the location of the leader token, if that card was the kennel one). then, if a player has the leader token, they take the leader sheet; otherwise the current leader keeps it. in either case, the new leader draws 1 location card and places the leader token in that location.encounters characters lying down are out of play and do not participate in encounters or contagion checks. a lone character encounters a dog that player makes a contagion check (draw 1 infection token from the contagion bag). two or more characters encounter a dog the dog is captured and placed directly in the kennel. do not make a contagion check because of the dog. while any dogs are locked up, add the kennel location card to the location deck. after the dog is locked up, resolve the encounter as if it were one between 2 or more characters. two or more characters any player whose suspicion disk is not in the green area of the suspicion track places 2 of their contagion tokens facedown in front of them, corresponding to their role. if they are human, they must place 2 human tokens; if they are alien, they may choose to place either 1 human and 1 alien token, or 2 human tokens. then, everyone in the encounter makes a contagion check. one or more characters encounter an exposed alien add up the strength value of all the characters in the location (each has a strength of 1) and compare it to the total alien strength token value in the location. alien’s strength less than characters: the alien runs away. characters may perform their actions normally. if there are several, they make a contagion check after the alien escapes. alien’s strength greater than characters: the alien can choose to assimilate 1 living being (dog or character) in the location, or sabotage the location. assimilate: add a new 1 point alien strength token to the location, and the assimilated being is dead (a character is out of the game and their role is not revealed; though their player is considered part of the human team and will win if the humans win). the other characters escape, and are placed in the leisure room, lying down. sabotage: place damage counters equal to the alien’s strength there (or perform the location’s damage action). the characters escape, and are placed in the leisure room, lying down. alien’s strength = characters: the alien runs away. characters in the location are laid down and cannot perform any actions. if the alien is alone with a dog, they may assimilate the dog (removing it from play) or sabotage the location. if a character is in an encounter with an exposed alien, they may use a dynamite/molotov, or flamethrower to discard a 1 point alien strength token and force the alien to run away. any encounter with an exposed alien does not affect the suspicion disks on the track. an exposed alien that loses its last alien strength token is defeated, but there may be another undetected alien. setting a location on fire the leader can choose to allow or deny a character to set a location on fire. during phase 4, after encounters and immediately before character actions are resolved, a character with a dynamite/molotov or a flamethrower can set a location on fire. that location is then destroyed and no player may move to it or take any locations in it for the rest of the game. discard 1 facedown action card from the active cards stack (and a reload token if necessary) and place a fire token on the location, remove its location card from the deck, then return the freezing marker to the starting position on its track. if a location is burned down when there are other characters in it, all the characters there are placed, lying down, in the leisure room. dogs are placed outside the board, and will come back at the end of the round.weapons and items you may hold any number of weapon and item cards at once. when you draw a card or token, keep it secret from the other players until you use it (except for the flamethrower). except where noted, each card or lab token is removed from the game when used. weapon or item cards that are discarded are returned to the bottom of their deck in random order. if a weapon or item deck runs out, players cannot draw any more (unless an exposed alien returns cards to the decks). weapons dynamite / molotov to fight the alien, discard 1 facedown action card from the active cards stack and lay down your character. the alien discards a 1 point alien strength token from the location and runs away. to set a location on fire, discard 1 facedown action card from the active cards stack and lay down your character in the leisure room. firearm use to avoid human encounters (and the subsequent contagion check), but may be kept after use. flamethrower when you draw this card, place it faceup in front of you and put 6 reload tokens on it. to fight the alien, discard 1 token, discard 1 facedown action card from the active cards stack, and lay down your character. the alien discards a 1 point alien strength token from the location and runs away. to avoid a human encounter (and the subsequent contagion check), discard 1 reload token. to set a location on fire, discard 1 reload token and 1 facedown action card from the active cards stack and lay down your standee/miniature in the leisure room. melee weapon use to avoid human encounters (and the subsequent contagion check). items flashlight use to avoid the effects of darkness (play your cards normally), and may be kept after use. if you use the special action option, you may look at 2 cards and choose 1 to give to the leader, then discard the other. fuel use to take 1 fuel token from the warehouse and place it in a location where your character is located. this is a free bonus action. keys (base helicopter and snow cat) use to escape in the base helicopter or snow cat. the vehicle must be fuelled and repaired and the leader must assign the use action card to you during phase 4. tools use to remove 1 damage token from a location without using a repair card if your character is in the location. this is a free bonus action. wire use with a flamethrower to conduct a test b during phase 6. discard 1 reload token. may be kept after use.winning the game all the humans win if they all escape from the base, with no aliens escaping with them. this can be by: rescue helicopter: during phase 4, if the rescue helicopter has arrived, immediately after all encounters are resolved, the character with the lowest suspicion value may choose to get on board the rescue helicopter regardless of which location he is in (on a tie, the tied player first in turn order can choose). if they do not choose to board, no escape via the helicopter is attempted this round. if they do choose to board, the second least suspected character may decide to board, but only if the character already on board lets them. if not, they stay on the ground and the third least suspected decides, and so on. this continues until a new character is allowed on board. if and when that happens, that player shows their role card. if they are alien, the game ends immediately and the aliens win. if they are human, go through the process again, starting with the least suspected character who has not boarded. this time, all the players already on the helicopter must agree. these rounds continue until the end of the suspicion track is reached and no one else has been picked up, when the helicopter leaves. the characters still on the ground show their role cards, and if they are all aliens, the humans win; but if just 1 human is on the ground, the aliens win. base helicopter or snow cat: a character with the keys can go to the base helicopter or snow cat/shed and, if it is ready, when they are given a use action card by the leader, can show the keys and start the escape process. use the same process as the rescue helicopter (other characters do not have to be in the same location). if no one else gets on, the owner of the keys is the only one to escape. the alien wins if: • it assimilates the last human. • there are 1 or more humans that die frozen in the base. • it escapes along with the humans (in the rescue helicopter, base helicopter, or snow cat). • it escapes alone in human form (in the rescue helicopter, base helicopter, or snow cat). when the last human is eliminated by assimilation, that human is the loser and the members of the opposite team the winners. if the alien team has no revealed player, the last one human who was assimilated is considered the loser. notes add to norris special ability: moreover, if he uses the special action, he may look at two cards and choose one to give to the leader, then discard the other.the thing 1. weather conditions the leader rolls the weather die and places the result on the weather table. if the die is in the weather station, keep the new result or use the previous one. 2. maintenance/ rescue helicopter the base consumes fuel tokens according to the weather table result. if there is not enough fuel, discard all the fuel tokens in the location, then take damage counters equal to the difference. boiler room: if there is 3 damage here, cover the location with the freezing tile and freezing marker. from now on, this marker is updated according to the broken boiler row of the weather table. generator room: if there is 2 damage here, place the power fail token: darkness rules now apply. when the generator is broken, it does not consume fuel. when a player removes at least 1 damage, remove the token. rescue helicopter: if the sos has been sent, move the fuel token on the helicopter track down 1 space and advance the rescue helicopter on the rescue track according to the weather table. if the helicopter has arrived, just move the fuel token 1 space. if the fuel token was already on the last space, the helicopter departs, abandoning all players. 3. alien actions this phase takes place only if the alien player has voluntarily revealed themselves or has been exposed by a test. the alien player chooses and places facedown 1 or more cards from the location deck, and places a number of alien strength tokens on each card (a min of 1 each). the total point value on a location card determines the alien’s strength in that location. 4. character cards & actions starting with the leader, each character draws action cards up to the hand limit (normally 3). the leader draws 1 more card and places it facedown on the leader sheet without looking, starting the leader stack. 1. character movement & action planning starting with the player to the leader’s left, each player must carry out one of these options: place your character in a location and place 1 action card facedown on the leader sheet. if your suspicion disk is in the red, you must reveal your card. take any leader token on the location. instead, you may move your character to the location and discard all your action cards. then draw 1 card, look at it, and place it facedown on the leader stack. darkness: the player to your left draws 1 action card randomly from your hand and places it facedown on the leader stack without looking at it.change cards. lay your character down in the dormitory, discard all your cards, and choose an equal number from the action card deck. shuffle the action card deck and discard pile. encounters 1. an expose alien reveals their location cards and places the alien strength tokens in those location(s). if the alien is alone in a location, they can sabotage it. if there are other characters or dogs there, resolve an encounter. 2. a character with a weapon may use it to avoid an encounter. then resolve remaining encounters, 1 location at a time, in an order chosen by the leader. contagion check: each player involved secretly looks at 1 of the 2 contagion tokens of one other character in the encounter (or 1 token from the contagion bag, if a dog), then returns it and advances their own suspicion disk 1 space. if there are more than 2 players in an encounter, each takes 1 contagion token from only one other player of their choice. they must then pick up all their role cards, mix them, and place the card matching their new role under their character sheet. 2. execute character actions the leader shuffles the action stack cards, then must turn over and play at least 1 card from it, assigning its effect to any 1 standing character in any location where the action can be taken. after the action is performed, lay that character down. if assigned a use or repair action in a location with a cooperation bonus with more than 1 standing character, repeat the action as many times as there are standing characters. then lay down only the character the action was assigned to. if there are no available characters that can perform the action, the action is lost, but a character must still be chosen to lie down. after each action card is completed, the leader may reveal another, or stop and discard the rest facedown. 5. leisure room & accusations all characters (not exposed aliens) go to the leisure room. players may exchange weapon/item cards and facedown lab tokens. then the leader counts to 3, and each player points at another player they think is an alien (cross your arms to abstain). if your suspicion disk is in the green you cannot be accused. starting with the leader, each player’s suspicion disk moves forward 1 space for each player who voted for them. an infected player may choose to reveal themselves. 6. tests the entire group may perform 1 test a and 1 test b per round. the leader decides which of the eligible players perform tests. test a: a player with a blood bag may perform 1 test a on the character with the highest level of suspicion. test b: a player who owns both a wire and a flamethrower may perform 1 test b on any character: discard 1 reload token. the chosen character must show everyone their current role card. if human, move their suspicion disc to the green. if alien, they immediately begin playing as an exposed alien.when an alien is exposed, remove their character from the game and discard their cards and tokens (lab tokens facedown). if they are the leader, pass the leader sheet to the left. if they are the first to become an alien, they take the location deck, and alien strength tokens with a total value equal to half the number of players, rounded down. otherwise, they add a 1 point alien strength token to the current alien’s pool. 7 . food consumption if there are any supplies in the kitchen, discard them all. if there are none, discard 4 food tokens from the pantry. if there is not enough food, all players’ hand limits are reduced to 2 cards. 8. dog movement & leader change the leader shuffles the location deck and reveals a number of cards equal to the number of dogs not in the kennel. for each card, place 1 dog in that location. if the kennel card is drawn, the kennel is unlocked and all dogs must be placed. a player with the leader token takes the leader sheet; otherwise the current leader keeps it. draw 1 location card and place the leader token in that location. encounters a lone character encounters a dog: contagion check. two or more characters encounter a dog: place the dog in the kennel (do not make a contagion check). while any dogs are locked up, add the kennel card to the location deck. then, resolve the encounter as if it were between 2 or more characters. two or more characters: any player whose suspicion disk is not in the green places 2 of their contagion tokens facedown in front of them. if human, they must place 2 human tokens; if alien, they may place 1 human and 1 alien token, or 2 human tokens. then, everyone in the encounter makes a contagion check. one or more characters encounter an exposed alien: add up the strength value of all the characters (1 each) and compare it to the total alien strength token value in the location: alien’s strength less than characters: the alien runs away. characters may perform their actions normally. if there are multiple characters, they make a contagion check after the alien escapes. alien’s strength greater than characters: the alien can assimilate 1 dog or character, or sabotage the location. assimilate: add a new 1 point alien strength token to the location, and the assimilated being is dead (a character's role is not revealed). the other characters are placed in the leisure room, lying down. sabotage: place a number of damage counters equal to the alien’s strength there (or perform the location’s damage action). place the characters in the leisure room, lying down. alien’s strength = characters: the alien runs away. characters in the location are laid down and cannot perform any actions. if the alien is alone with a dog, they may assimilate it (removing it from play) or sabotage the location.locations armory ✖ max 3 players + exposed alien + 1 dog use: draw 2

with the side corresponding to 6 players faceup. fill the pantry spaces with 16 food tokens. place the kennel location card on the kennel location, then shuffle the rest of the location cards to form a facedown deck. place 1 damage counter on the snow cat/shed, and 4 damage counters on the base helicopter. place 6 damage counters in the radio room, covering the appropriate spaces. place the remaining damage counters in the operations room. create the weapon deck using the following cards, then shuffle it and place it facedown in the armory: 3 dynamite/molotov, 2 firearms, 1 flamethrower, and 4 melee weapons. create the item deck using the following cards, then shuffle it and place it facedown in the warehouse: 3 flashlights, 3 fuel, 2 keys, 3 tools, and 2 wire. fill the generator room and boiler room tracks with fuel tokens (4 each), on the spaces marked . place 1 fuel token on the rescue helicopter track in the full tank space (furthest to the left). place 14 fuel tokens in the underground warehouse (next to the boiler room) and 5 fuel tokens in the external reserve (the yellow area between the base helicopter and the shed/snow cat). put 12 blood bag tokens and 18 failure lab tokens in the pink laboratory bag. players select (or distribute randomly) the character sheets: all 6 to a solo player, 3 to each player in a 2 player game, or 2 to each player in a 3 player game. put your standee/miniatures in the plastic bases of the appropriate colors. place all characters in the leisure room. each character gets the components of their color (1 suspicion disk and 1 contagion token). place the suspicion disk on the yellow space of the suspicion track and the contagion token on the character sheet to indicate their color. shuffle the 8 special role cards (marked for 1-3 players) and place 1 facedown under each character sheet without looking at them. put the rest back in the box without looking at them. put the strength 4 alien standee/miniature on space 6 of the suspicion track: this is the alien threat token. put all the 7 dog infection tokens and 2 alien infection tokens into the green contagion bag. place the rescue helicopter on the helicopter icon on the sos track. place the power failure token, the freezing tile, the freezing marker, the alien strength tokens, the alien standees/miniatures, the dog miniatures, the flamethrower reload tokens, the fire tokens, and the weather die next to the board in the reserve.the alien standees/miniatures represent a value of 1, 2, 3, or 4 strength and are considered alien strength tokens. they may be exchanged at any time for tokens of equal total value. the player who most recently watched the thing is the first player and takes the leader sheet for 1-3 players (without the +1). game phases 1. weather conditions the leader rolls the weather die and places it result side up on the matching symbol on the weather table. if the die is in the weather station, the leader may keep the result they just rolled, or use the result that was showing before they rolled. 2. base maintenance and rescue helicopter advancement according to the results on the weather table, the base must consume fuel tokens in the generator room and the boiler room. if there not enough to satisfy requirements, discard all the fuel tokens in the location, then that location receives damage counters equal to the difference (up to the maximum number possible on its track). boiler room: if there are 3 damage counters here during this check, place the freezing tile on the location, with the freezing marker at the start of the track. from now on, the freezing marker is updated according to the row of the weather table that depicts the broken boiler (instead of consuming fuel tokens according to the working boiler icon row). if the marker reaches the end of this track, the humans freeze and the alien wins the game. generator room: if there are 2 damage counters here during this check, place the power fail token in the location. darkness rules are now applied during the character actions phase. when the generator is broken, it does not consume fuel tokens. the power fail token can be removed as soon as a player removes at least 1 damage counter from this room. rescue helicopter: if the sos has been sent from the radio room, move the fuel token on the helicopter track down 1 space, and advance the rescue helicopter on the rescue track according to the weather conditions on the weather table. if the rescue helicopter has already arrived (reached the last space of the track), just move the fuel token 1 space. if the fuel token was already on the last space, the helicopter departs, abandoning all players in the base. 3. character movement starting with the leader, each player must choose one of these options for each of their characters: place your character in a location other than the dormitory: if multiple characters are in the same location, each advances their disk 1 space on the suspicion track. if the suspicion disks of any characters are in the same space as the alien threat token, see exposing the alien. if a lone character encounters a dog, instead make a contagion check by drawing a token from the contagion bag, looking at it, and returning it to the bag. if an alien infection token was drawn, the character is immediately exposed as an alien. place your character in the dormitory: in phase 5, this character may change the result of 1 unused action die to a result of your choice; then lay the character down. during each round, only 1 character may go to the dormitory.4. alien actions this phase takes place only if the alien has been exposed. the main purposes of the ai alien are, in order, to assimilate characters, to assimilate dogs, and finally to sabotage the locations. the alien attacks random locations, and will always try to attack each location with enough strength to defeat the largest number of characters at any location. first identify the location with the most characters in it. the number of characters plus 1 is the alien’s attack goal this round. then draw a location card and place it facedown. place alien strength tokens with a total value equal to the attack goal on that card. if the alien doesn’t have enough strength, place all its available strength. if the alien has any strength tokens remaining, draw another card and repeat the process. continue until it has used all its available alien strength tokens. then reveal the location cards, place the tokens in the matching locations, and resolve encounters and sabotages as normal. if the alien is alone in a location, they can sabotage it, inflicting damage as indicated in each location’s profile. if there are other characters or dogs in that location, resolve an encounter. a character with a weapon (firearm, flamethrower, or melee weapon) may choose to use it to avoid an encounter involving them (if there is more than 1 other being there, an encounter still occurs without that character). players then resolve all remaining encounters, one location at a time, in an order chosen by the leader. 5. character actions the leader rolls the 3 action dice, then decides which character to assign those dice to. if a player has a character in the dormitory, they may now change the result of one of the dice to a result of their choice; then lay the character down. the assigned character’s player may cancel 1 or more of the action dice results by advancing their suspicion disk 1 space on the suspicion track for each canceled result. if any uncanceled sabotage and/or alien advance results remain, all must be resolved, canceling the action of the character (but laying them down anyway): sabotage: perform the sabotage action for the location occupied by the character. alien threat advance: advance the alien threat token 1 space to the left on the suspicion track. if neither of these results were resolved, the character may perform 1 action ( use or repair ) corresponding to the result of a single action die (if any), then the character is laid down. alternatively, the character use a use or repair result to burn their current location. if a character is assigned a use or repair action in a location with a cooperation bonus , and there is more than 1 standing character in that location, they repeat the action as many times as there are standing characters there. then, lay down only the one character to whom the action was assigned, to show the action has been performed. after resolving at least 1 character’s action, the leader may roll the action dice again and choose another character to assign them to, or stop and proceed to the next phase. the leader may continue as long as there are standing characters available. darkness: roll the action dice only after assigning them to a character. a flashlight allows a character to re-roll up to 3 dice (they may be rolled one at a time, but each die may only be re- rolled once).6. leisure room all players return their characters to the leisure room. players may exchange weapon and/or item cards (and lab tokens, without revealing them) with each other. 7 . tests each player with a blood bag and/or a wire and a flamethrower is eligible to perform up to 1 test per type (even on different characters). you can also perform a test on yourself to reveal your role to other characters. the entire group may perform one test a and one test b per round. the leader decides which of the eligible players perform tests. test a: a player with a blood bag may perform a single test a on the character with the highest level of suspicion on the suspicion track (on a tie, the owner of the blood bag chooses whom to test). show and discard the blood bag and indicate the character you are testing. test b: a player who owns both a wire and a flamethrower may perform a single test b on any character, by discarding 1 reload token and indicate the character you are testing. in both cases, the chosen character must show everyone their special role card. if they are human, move their suspicion disc to the green area of the track. if they are alien, remove that character from the game. if this is the first time the alien has been exposed, it starts with alien strength tokens with a total value of 5. otherwise, add a 1 point alien strength token to the current alien’s pool. 8. food consumption if there are any supplies in the kitchen, discard them all. if there are none, 4 food tokens must be discarded directly from the pantry. if there is not enough food, all characters become hungry, and their players’ maximum hand limit is immediately reduced to 2 cards (discarding 1 of their choice if necessary). 9. dog movement, leader change, and alien threat movement the leader takes all the dogs that are not in the kennel, shuffles the location deck, then reveals a number of cards equal to the number of dogs not in the kennel. for each card, place 1 dog in the corresponding location. if at any point the kennel card is drawn, the kennel is unlocked. the leader must continue drawing cards and placing dogs until all of them have been placed in locations. in a 2 or 3 player game, the player to the left of the leader takes the leader sheet. finally, move the alien threat token: • if it is alone, move it 1 space to the left. • if it is together with the suspicion disks of 1 or more characters, move it a number of spaces to the right equal to the number of suspicion disks in its place. if this movement brings the alien threat token into a space occupied by a suspicion disk, that character becomes an alien. if more than 1 suspicion disk occupies the space, only 1 of the characters (chosen by the leader), becomes an alien.encounters characters lying down are out of play and do not participate in encounters and/or contagion checks. if multiple characters are in the same location, each advances their disk 1 space on the suspicion track. if the suspicion disks of any characters are in the same space as the alien threat token, see exposing the alien. a lone character encounters a dog make a contagion check (draw 1 infection token from the contagion bag, look at it, and return it to the bag). if an alien token is drawn, that character is immediately exposed. two or more characters encounter a dog the dog is captured and placed directly in the kennel. do not make a contagion check for the dog. while any dogs are locked up, add the kennel location card to the location deck. after the dog is locked up, resolve the encounter as if it was an encounter between 2 or more characters. two or more characters each of the characters who encounters at least 1 character whose suspicion disk is not in the green area of the suspicion track advances their suspicion disk 1 space on the track. one or more characters encounter an exposed alien add up the strength value of all the characters in the location (each has a strength of 1) and compare it to the total alien strength token value in the location. alien’s strength less than characters: the alien runs away. characters may perform their actions normally. alien’s strength greater than characters: the alien can choose to assimilate 1 living being (dog or character) in the location, or sabotage the location. if they assimilate, add a new 1 point alien strength token to the location, and the assimilated being is dead (a character is out of the game and their special role card is not revealed; though their player is considered part of the human team and will win if the humans win). the other characters escape, and are placed in the leisure room, lying down. if they sabotage, place a number of damage counters equal to the alien’s strength there (or perform the location’s damage action). the characters escape, and are placed in the leisure room, lying down. alien’s strength equal to characters: the alien runs away. characters in the location are laid down and cannot perform any actions. if the alien is alone with a dog, they may assimilate the dog (removing it from play) or sabotage the location. if a character is in an encounter with an exposed alien, they may use a dynamite/molotov, or flamethrower to discard a 1 point alien strength token and force the alien to run away. any encounter with an exposed alien does not affect the suspicion disks on the track. an exposed alien that loses its last alien strength token is defeated, but there may be another undetected alien.exposing the alien the alien can be exposed in 3 different ways: 1. through a test. 2. through an encounter with a dog. 3. if the suspicion disk of 1 or more characters in is in the same space as the alien threat token. move the alien threat token a number of spaces to the right equal to the number of suspicion disks in the space of the assimilated character. the alien’s strength is 5 the first time it is exposed. if an alien is already in play, add a 1 point alien strength token as normal. if there are multiple suspicion disks in the same space of the track, the leader decides which character is transformed into an alien (the character bdoes not reveal their special role card). if your character is exposed as an alien or assimilated, remove them from the game, discard their cards to their respective decks, and discard all their tokens (lab tokens facedown). if they are the leader and it is a 2-3 player game, pass the leader sheet to the player on their left. if your last character gets exposed or assimilated, you can take control of another player's character. setting a location on fire the leader can choose to allow or deny a character to set a location on fire. during phase 5, a character with a dynamite/ molotov or a flamethrower can set a location on fire. that location is then destroyed and no player may move to it or take any locations in it for the rest of the game. discard 1 use or repair result assigned to the character (and a reload token if necessary) and place a fire token on the location, remove its location card from the deck, then return the freezing marker to the starting position on its track. if a location is burned down when there are other characters in it, all the characters there are placed, lying down, in the leisure room. dogs are placed outside the board, and will come back at the end of the round. character changes any characters whose abilities refer to being assigned action cards apply to action dice instead. garry during phase 5, after the action dice are rolled and assigned to him, he may re-roll any 1 die. norris during phase 5, after the action dice are rolled and assigned to him, he may re-roll up to 3 dice, 1 time each. this ability only works when in darkness. location changes dormitory any number of characters, no exposed alien the player of a character here may choose the result of 1 action die during a roll. lay the character down and turn the die to show the desired face. kennel only exposed alien and dogs if the kennel card is drawn during phase 4, the alien assimilates 1 dog currently in the kennel (if any), following the base rules. kitchen (and pantry) max 3 players + exposed alien + 1 dog if the characters become hungry, only 2 action dice are rolled instead of 3 during the character actions phase. weapons and items you may hold any number of weapon and item cards at once. when you draw a card or token, keep it secret from the other players until you use it (except for the flamethrower). except where noted, each card or lab token is removed from the game when used. weapon or item cards that are discarded are returned to the bottom of their deck in random order. if a weapon or item deck runs out, players cannot draw any more (unless an exposed alien returns cards to the decks). weapons dynamite / molotov to fight the alien, lay down your character (in the immediately subsequent action phase, dice will be assigned 1 less time). the alien discards a 1 point alien strength token from the location and runs away. to set a location on fire, discard 1 facedown action card from the active cards stack and lay down your character in the leisure room. firearm use to avoid human encounters (and the subsequent contagion check), but may be kept after use. flamethrower when you draw this card, place it faceup in front of you and put 6 reload tokens on it. to fight the alien, lay down your character (in the immediately subsequent action phase, dice will be assigned 1 less time). the alien discards a 1 point alien strength token from the location and runs away. to avoid a human encounter (and the subsequent contagion check), discard 1 reload token. to set a location on fire, discard 1 reload token and 1 facedown action card from the active cards stack and lay down your standee/miniature in the leisure room. melee weapon use to avoid human encounters (and the subsequent contagion check). items flashlight use to avoid the effects of darkness (play your cards normally), and may be kept after use. if you use the special action option, you may look at 2 cards and choose 1 to give to the leader, then discard the other. fuel use to take 1 fuel token from the warehouse and place it in a location where your character is located. this is a free bonus action. keys (base helicopter and snow cat) use to escape in the base helicopter or snow cat. the vehicle must be fuelled and repaired and the leader must assign the use action card to you during phase 4. tools use to remove 1 damage token from a location without using a repair card if your character is in the location. this is a free bonus action. wire use with a flamethrower to conduct a test b during phase 6. discard 1 reload token. may be kept after use.winning the game all the humans win if they all escape from the base, with no aliens escaping with them. when one of the escape methods is about to be attempted, the alien moves to the chosen escape location and rolls a number of action dice equal to its strength. if the roll has a total of 3 or more sabotage and/or alien threat advance results, the escape is interrupted and play immediately skips to phase 6 and continues. if not, the humans can attempt their escape. humans can escape by: rescue helicopter: during phase 4, if the rescue helicopter has arrived, immediately after all encounters are resolved, the character with the lowest suspicion value may choose to get on board the rescue helicopter regardless of which location they are in (on a tie, the tied player first in turn order can choose). if they do not choose to board, no escape via the helicopter is attempted this round. if they do choose to board, the second least suspected character may decide to board, but only if the character already on board lets them. if not, they stay on the ground and the third least suspected decides, and so on. this continues until a new character is allowed on board. if and when that happens, that player shows their role card. if they are alien, the game ends immediately and the aliens win. if they are human, go through the process again, starting with the least suspected character who has not boarded. this time, all the players already on the helicopter must agree. these rounds continue until the end of the suspicion track is reached and no one else has been picked up, when the helicopter leaves. the characters still on the ground show their role cards, and if they are all aliens, the humans win; but if just 1 human is on the ground, the aliens win. base helicopter or snow cat: a character with the keys can go to the base helicopter or snow cat/shed and, if it is ready, when they are given a use action card by the leader, can show the keys and start the escape process. use the same process as the rescue helicopter (other characters do not have to be in the same location). if no one else gets on, the owner of the keys is the only one to escape. the alien wins if: • it assimilates the last human. • there are 1 or more humans that die frozen in the base. • it escapes along with the humans (in the rescue helicopter, base helicopter, or snow cat). • it escapes alone in human form (in the rescue helicopter, base helicopter, or snow cat). when the last human is eliminated by assimilation, that human is the loser and the members of the opposite team the winners. if the alien team has no revealed player, the last one human who was assimilated is considered the loser.the thing: norwegian outpost setup the expansion is only compatible with the 4-8 player version of the base game. use the expansion base board. with 6-8 players, cover the weather table printed on the board with the weather table card, with the side corresponding to the number of players faceup. fill the pantry spaces with 16 food tokens. return the kennel location card to the box. place the shack location card on the shack, then shuffle the rest of the cards to form a facedown deck. reveal the first card and place the leader token in that location, then shuffle the card back into the deck. place the damage counters in a pil in the large red operations room. return 2 dynamite and 2 molotov weapon cards to the box, then add the expansion cards. create the weapon deck using the following cards, then shuffle it and place it facedown in the armory: 4-5 players: 3 sniper rifles, 1 firearm, 1 flamethrower, 3 melee weapons, and 3 grenades. 6-7 players: 3 sniper rifles, 2 firearms, 1 flamethrower, 4 melee weapons, and 3 grenades. 8 players: 3 sniper rifles, 2 firearms, 2 flamethrowers, 4 melee weapons, and 4 grenades. return 3 flashlight and 2 wire item cards to the box, then add the expansion cards. create the item deck using the following cards, then shuffle it and place it facedown in the warehouse: 4-5 players: 2 flashlights, 2 fuel, 3 keys, and 2 tools. 6 players: 3 flashlights, 2 fuel, 3 keys, and 2 tools. 7 players: 3 flashlights, 3 fuel, 3 keys, and 3 tools. 8 players: 3 flashlights, 4 fuel, 3 keys, and 4 tools. fill the generator room and boiler room tracks with fuel tokens (4 each), on the spaces marked . place 1 fuel token on the rescue helicopter track in the full tank space (furthest to the left). place a number of fuel tokens in the underground warehouse (next to the boiler room) according to the number of players: up to 5 players: 10 tokens. 6 players: 14 tokens. 7-8 players: 18 tokens. put 2 blood bag tokens and 3 failure lab tokens in the pink laboratory bag for each player. shuffle the deck of action cards and place it facedown near the board. each player takes the components of their chosen color (1 suspicion disk, 3 contagion tokens, 2 role cards, and 2 dental record cards, 1 healthy and 1 with fillings), and 2 action cards randomly drawn from the action deck. place your suspicion disk on the yellow space of the suspicion track. each player chooses (or distribute randomly) 1 character sheet. put your standee/miniature in the plastic base of your color. place all characters in the leisure room. take 1 alien infection token and as many npc infection tokens as there are players minus 1, mix them up, and give 1 to each player randomly. the player who gets the alien token is the alien player at the start of the game. do not reveal if you are human or alien! each player takes the role card that matches their role (human or alien) and tucks it facedown under their character sheet. each player then shuffles their 2 dental record cards, looks at a random one, and places it under their character sheet. the alien player must choose their healthy teeth card instead.finally, put all 7 npc infection tokens and 2 alien infection tokens into the green contagion bag. place the rescue helicopter on the helicopter icon on the sos track. place the power failure token, the freezing tile, the freezing marker, the alien strength tokens, the alien standees/miniatures, the flamethrower reload tokens, the fire tokens, the weather die, the ufo board, the ufo sector cards, the 5 launch sequence cards, and the departure tokens next to the board in the reserve. place 1 dog miniature on the first space of the dog escape track. the alien standees/miniatures represent a value of 1, 2, 3, or 4 strength and are considered alien strength tokens. they may be exchanged at any time for tokens of equal total value. the player who most recently watched the thing is the first player and takes the leader sheet with +1 on it. game phases 1. weather conditions the leader rolls the weather die and places it result side up on the matching symbol on the weather table. if the die is in the weather station, the leader may keep the result they just rolled, or use the result that was showing before they rolled. 2. base maintenance and rescue helicopter advancement according to the results on the weather table, the base must consume fuel tokens in the generator room and the boiler room. if there not enough to satisfy requirements, discard all the fuel tokens in the location, then that location receives damage counters equal to the difference (up to the maximum number possible on its track). boiler room: if there are 3 damage counters here during this check, place the freezing tile on the location, with the freezing marker at the start of the track. from now on, the freezing marker is updated according to the row of the weather table that depicts the broken boiler (instead of consuming fuel tokens according to the row with the working boiler icon). if the marker reaches the end of this track, the humans freeze and the alien wins the game. generator room: if there are 2 damage counters here during this check, place the power fail token in the location. darkness rules are now applied during the draw character cards & take character actions phase. when the generator is broken, it does not consume fuel tokens. the power fail token can be removed as soon as a player removes at least 1 damage counter from this room. rescue helicopter: if the sos has been sent from the radio room, move the fuel token on the helicopter track down 1 space, and advance the rescue helicopter on the rescue track according to the weather conditions on the weather table. if the rescue helicopter has already arrived (reached the last space of the track), just move the fuel token 1 space. if the fuel token was already on the last space, the helicopter departs, abandoning all players in the base. 3. alien actions this phase takes place only if the alien player has voluntarily revealed themselves or has been exposed by a test. the alien player chooses 1 or more cards from the location deck and places them facedown in front of them. for each card played, they must decide how many alien strength tokens (and/or standees/miniatures) to place on it (a minimum of 1 each).the total point value of these tokens on a location card determines the alien’s strength in that location. the cards are only revealed after all players have placed their characters and handed their action cards to the leader in phase 4. 4. draw character cards and take character actions starting with the leader, each character draws action cards to bring them to their maximum hand limit (normally 3 cards). if a card must be drawn and there are none left, shuffle the discards to form a new deck. if you already hold the maximum number of cards, do not draw any new ones. then the leader draws 1 additional action card and places it facedown on the leader sheet without looking at it. there are 3 types of action cards: use (activates the function of the location); repair (removes a damage counter), and sabotage (places a damage counter in the location, if not fully damaged, or performs the damage action at that location). 1. character movement & action planning starting with the player to the left of the leader, each player must carry out one of these options: place your character in a location and hand over an action card: place your character in the desired location, choose 1 action card from your hand, and place it facedown on the leader sheet. these cards form the leader stack. if your suspicion disk is in the red, you must reveal any action cards you play. players cannot tell anyone which cards are in their hand or which they are playing. a maximum of 3 characters may be in each green location. if the leader token is in the chosen location, pick it up and place it in front of you for the next round. special action: if you do not have the right cards to perform an action but do not want to lose a turn to change cards, you may move your character to the desired location and discard all your action cards. then draw 1 card from the action card deck, look at it, and place it facedown on the leader stack. darkness: the players do not get to choose which action card they place in front of the leader. instead, the player to the left draws 1 card randomly from your hand and places it in front of the leader without looking at it. change cards: if you’re not happy with your cards, you may lay your character down in the dormitory (and perform no more actions for the rest of the round), discard your hand of cards, and choose an equal number of cards from the action deck. then, shuffle the action deck with its discard pile to create a new deck. encounters after all players have taken their turn, an encounter occurs in any location where there are multiple beings (more than 1 character, or 1 character and any npcs and/or exposed aliens). 1. if the alien has been exposed, they reveal their location cards and place the related alien strength tokens in the corresponding location(s). if the alien is alone in a location, they can sabotage it, inflicting damage as indicated in each location’s profile. if there are other characters or npcs in that location, an encounter is resolved. 2. once all situations with exposed aliens have been resolved, a character with a weapon (firearm, flamethrower, or melee weapon) may choose to use it to avoid an encounter involving themselves (if there is more than 1 other being there, an encounter still occurs without that character). players then resolve all remaining encounters, one location at a time, in an order chosen by the leader. contagion check when an encounter occurs between 2 or more characters or between 1 character and a npc, each player involved secretly looks at 1 of the 2 contagion tokens of one other character in the encounter (or 1 infection token from the contagion bag when encountering a npc), then returns it to its owner (or the bag) and advances their own suspicion disk 1 space on the suspicion track. if there are more than 2 players in an encounter, each of them must simultaneously take 1 contagion token from only one other player of their choice. they must then pick up all their role and dental record cards (whether infected or not), mix them, secretly look at them, and place the role card matching their new role under their character sheet, along with the healthy teeth card if they are now an alien. 2. execute character actions all encounters must be resolved before the cards in the active stack are assigned by the leader. the leader shuffles the cards in the action stack. then they must turn over and play at least 1 action card from the stack. they must assign the effect of that card to any 1 character still standing in any location where the action on the card can be taken. after the action has been performed, lay the chosen character down; they cannot be assigned any more cards this round. if a character is assigned a use or repair action in a location with a cooperation bonus , and there is more than 1 standing character in that location, they repeat the action as many times as there are standing characters there. then, lay down only the one character to whom the action was assigned, to show the action has been performed. if there are no available characters that can perform the action, that action is lost, but a character in the base must still be chosen by the leader to lie down. after each action card is completed, the leader may choose to reveal another card, or stop and discard the rest of them facedown in the discard pile without looking at them. the leader always has the last word on which character will be assigned and whether to stop revealing cards. 5. leisure room and accusations all players (except for exposed aliens) return their characters to the leisure room. players may exchange weapon and/or item cards (and lab tokens, without revealing them) with each other, and may accuse another player of being an alien. after discussion and the exchange of accusations, the leader counts to 3, then each player points their finger at another player they suspect of being an alien. players who don’t wish to vote should cross their arms. players whose suspicion disks are in the green area cannot be voted against. starting with the leader, move each player’s suspicion disk forward 1 space on the suspicion track for each player who voted for them. an infected player may choose to voluntarily reveal themselves at this time. from now on, they play as an exposed alien. 6. tests each player with a blood bag token and/or a flashlight is eligible to perform up to 1 test per type (even on different characters). you can also perform a test on yourself to reveal your role to other characters. the entire group may perform 1 test a per round, and 1 player may perform 1 test b per round on multiple characters. the leader decides which of the eligible players perform tests. test a: a player with a blood bag token may perform a single test a on the character with the highest level of suspicion on the suspicion track (on a tie, the owner of the blood bag token chooses whom to test). show and discard the blood bag token and indicate the character you are testing, who must then show everyone their current role card. if they are human, move their suspicion disc to the green area of the track. if they are alien, they immediately transform and begin playing as an exposed alien. test b: a player with a flashlight may perform a test b on any characters. discard 1 of your action cards facedown, and indicate the character you are testing, who must then show their dental record card to everyone. you may continue to test characters as long as you have action cards to discard. if the character has fillings, they are human: move their suspicion disc to the green area. if their teeth are healthy, the test has no other result. exposing yourself as an alien when an alien is exposed, they must remove their character from the game, discard their cards to their respective decks, and discard all their tokens (lab tokens facedown). if they are the leader, they pass the leader sheet to the player on their left. if they are the first to become an exposed alien, they take the location deck, and alien strength tokens with a total value equal to half the number of players in the game, rounded down. otherwise, they add a 1 point alien strength token to the current alien’s pool. from now on, all exposed alien players work together, sharing the alien strength tokens and all choices and actions. 7 . food consumption if there are any supplies in the kitchen, discard them all. if there are none, 4 food tokens must be discarded directly from the pantry . if there is not enough food, all characters become hungry, and their players’ maximum hand limit is immediately reduced to 2 cards (discarding 1 of their choice if necessary). 8. npc movement and leader change the leader takes all the npcs that are not in the shack, shuffles the location deck, then reveals a number of cards equal to the number of npcs not in the shack. for each card, place 1 npc in the corresponding location. if at any point the shack card is drawn, the shack is unlocked. the leader must continue drawing cards and placing npcs until all have been placed in locations (draw another card to determine the location of the leader token, if that card was the shack one). then, if a player has the leader token, they take the leader sheet; otherwise the current leader keeps it. in any case, the new leader draws 1 location card and places the leader token in that location. finally, advance the dog token 1 space on the dog escape track. encounters characters lying down are out of play and do not participate in encounters and/or contagion checks. a lone character encounters a npc that player makes a contagion check (draw 1 infection token from the contagion bag). two or more characters encounter a npc the npc is captured and placed directly in the shack. do not make a contagion check because of the npc. while any npcs are locked up, add the shack location card to the location deck. after the npc is locked up, resolve the encounter as if it were one between 2 or more characters. two or more characters any player whose suspicion disk is not in the green area places 2 of their contagion tokens facedown in front of them, corresponding to their role. if they are human, they must place 2 human tokens; if they are alien, they may choose to place either 1 human and 1 alien token, or 2 human tokens. then, everyone in the encounter makes a contagion check.one or more characters encounter an exposed alien add up the strength value of all the characters in the location (each has a strength of 1) and compare it to the total alien strength token value in the location. alien’s strength less than characters: the alien runs away. characters may perform their actions normally. if there are several, they make a contagion check after the alien escapes. alien’s strength greater than characters: the alien can choose to assimilate 1 living being (npc or character) in the location, or sabotage the location. if they assimilate, add a new 1 point alien strength token to the location, and the assimilated being is dead (a character is out of the game and their role is not revealed; though their player is considered part of the human team and will win if the humans win). the other characters escape, and are placed in the leisure room, lying down. if they sabotage, place a number of damage counters equal to the alien’s strength there (or perform the location’s damage action). the characters escape, and are placed in the leisure room, lying down. alien’s strength = characters: the alien runs. characters in the location are laid down and cannot perform any actions. if the alien is alone with a npc, they may assimilate the npc (removing it from play) or sabotage the location. if a character is in an encounter with an exposed alien, they may use a grenade or flamethrower to discard a 1 point alien strength token and force the alien to run away. any encounter with an exposed alien does not affect the suspicion disks on the track. an exposed alien that loses its last alien strength token is defeated, but there may be another undetected alien. setting a location on fire the leader can choose to allow or deny a character to set a location on fire. during phase 4, after encounters and immediately before character actions are resolved, a character with a grenade or a flamethrower can set a location on fire. that location is then destroyed and no player may move to it or take any locations in it for the rest of the game. discard 1 facedown action card from the active cards stack (and a reload token if necessary) and place a fire token on the location, remove its location card from the deck, then return the freezing marker to the starting position on its track. if a location is burned down when there are other characters in it, all the characters there are placed, lying down, in the leisure room. npcs are placed outside the board, and will come back at the end of the round. weapons and items you may hold any number of weapon and item cards at once. when you draw a card or token, keep it secret from the other players until you use it (except for the flamethrower). except where noted, each card or lab token is removed from the game when used. weapon or item cards that are discarded are returned to the bottom of their deck in random order. if a weapon or item deck runs out, players cannot draw any more (unless an exposed alien returns cards to the decks). weapons grenade to fight the alien, discard 1 facedown action card from the active cards stack and lay down your character. the alien discards a 1 point strength token from the location and runs away. to set a location on fire, discard 1 facedown action card from the active cards stack and lay down your character in the leisure room. sniper rifle place the card at the end of the dog escape track to increase the number of spaces the dog will have to advance on the track. only 1 sniper card can be played per game. this is a free bonus action. firearm use to avoid human encounters (and the subsequent contagion check), but may be kept after use. flamethrower when you draw this card, place it faceup in front of you and put 6 reload tokens on it. to fight the alien, discard 1 token, discard 1 facedown action card from the active cards stack, and lay down your character. the alien discards a 1 point alien strength token from the location and runs away. to avoid a human encounter (and the subsequent contagion check), discard 1 reload token. to set a location on fire, discard 1 reload token and 1 facedown action card from the active cards stack and lay down your standee/miniature in the leisure room. melee weapon use to avoid human encounters (and the subsequent contagion check). items flashlight use to avoid the effects of darkness (play your cards normally), and may be kept after use. if you use the special action option, you may look at 2 cards and choose 1 to give to the leader, then discard the other. fuel use to take 1 fuel token from the warehouse and place it in a location where your character is located. this is a free bonus action. keys (base helicopter and snow cat) use to escape in the base helicopter or snow cat. the vehicle must be fuelled and repaired and the leader must assign the use action card to you during phase 4. tools use to remove 1 damage token from a location without using a repair card if your character is in the location. this is a free bonus action. winning the game all the humans win if they all escape from the base, with no aliens escaping with them. humans can escape individually and in groups during phase 4. those who successfully escape by any means without aliens, while leaving other humans behind, are automatically winners and are out of the game, while the rest of the players continue. rescue helicopter during phase 4, if the rescue helicopter has arrived, immediately after all encounters are resolved, the character with the lowest suspicion value may choose to get on board the rescue helicopter regardless of which location they are in (on a tie, the tied player first in turn order can choose). if they do not choose to board, no escape via the helicopter is attempted this round. if they do choose to board, the second least suspected character may decide to board, but only if the character already on board lets them. if not, they stay on the ground and the third least suspected decides, and so on. this continues until a new character is allowed on board. if and when that happens, that player shows their role card. if they are alien, the game ends immediately and the aliens win. if they are human, go through the process again, starting with the least suspected character who has not boarded. this time, all the players already on the helicopter must agree. these rounds continue until the end of the suspicion track is reached and no one else has been picked up, when the helicopter leaves. the characters still on the ground show their role cards, and if they are all aliens, the humans win; but if just 1 human is on the ground, the aliens win. base helicopter or snow cat a character with the keys can go to the base helicopter or a snow cat and, if it is ready, when they are given a use action card by the leader, can show the keys and start the escape process. use the same process as the rescue helicopter (however all characters must be in the relevant location). once the escape process is complete, the vehicle is no longer available to the remaining players (cover the illustration with the used keys card). the alien wins if: • it assimilates the last human. • there are 1 or more humans that die frozen in the base. • it escapes in human form with or without other humans in the rescue helicopter or base helicopter. • it escapes in human form in a snow cat with humans. • it escapes in dog form (the dog token reaches the end of the dog escape track). • if an alien in human form uses a snow cat without bringing any humans along, it triggers the escape by ufo process. when the last human is eliminated by assimilation, that human is the loser and the members of the opposite team the winners. if the alien team has no revealed player, the last one human who was assimilated is considered the loser. escape by ufo when this process is triggered, replace the base board with the ufo board. shuffle the departure tokens and place 1 faceup in each sector, leaving the rest facedown as a reserve. arrange the launch sequence cards in ascending order of red dots, from left to right. all aliens are revealed and join the exposed alien team according to the base game rules. this team takes the 8 ufo sector cards. the aliens begin with the first action, placing their strength on different ufo sectors using the cards, complying with the minimum strength requirement printed in each sector. then the humans place their characters in the ufo sectors. the alien then reveals their sector cards and places their strength tokens. resolve any encounters using normal rules, but if the alien has the option to sabotage a location, or any characters have the option to perform actions in one, they instead have the option to collect departure tokens. after all encounters have been resolved, if the alien chooses not to assimilate a character (or there are none there), they may collect the tokens on the sector, plus a number of random tokens from the reserve equal to the sector's value. if any characters are still standing in a sector, they may collect only 1 token from the reserve; if the reserve is empty, they take it from the sector instead (if there is one). then, the alien may activate, in ascending order, up to 2 launch sequence cards by paying the required cost for each card (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) with departure tokens. there is no change; any excess is lost. if the alien team activates the last card in the sequence, the game immediately wins with an alien victory. if there are insufficient tokens available, the humans win. when the round is over and no one has won, a new round begins. the human players retrieve their characters, and the alien team retrieves their ufo sector cards and alien strength tokens. no additional departure tokens are added to the ufo board."
200,144529,THESEUS: THE DARK ORBIT,2013,PORTAL GAMES,2.8319,113,"setup each player chooses a faction and takes all of that faction’s components: a sector board, 3 unit tokens, 25 faction cards, a life point (lp) marker (and a data points (dp) marker if appropriate) and other faction tokens. place the life and data points board in the middle of the play area, with the end token near the final sequence track. players place their marker on the 20 space of the life points track. the scientists and greys factions place their data points token on the 0 space of the data points track. upgrade tokens are placed within reach of all players. place the sector boards around the above board in the following clockwise order: corridors > control room (with the malfunction token over the malfunction symbol) > first player’s sector > tech bay > second player’s sector. the first player is the player whose sector board is placed first after the corridors. the order of the other players is determined by the clockwise order of their sector boards. alternatively, players can place the sector boards randomly or in an order of their choice. shuffle the bonus cards and then place one random card faceup on each installed card slot market with the bonus card symbol, starting with the corridors sector and going clockwise. return unused cards to the box. each player shuffles his faction cards, takes the first 15 cards and returns the rest to the box unseen. each player draws 3 cards and, in turn order, selects one and places it faceup in any empty installed card slot in any sector. the other 2 cards go faceup in his faction sector’s 2 pending slots. the remaining 12 cards are a player’s deck. each player, in turn order, places 2 of his units (base side up) in any rooms in his faction sector. then, in turn order, each player places his third unit (base side up) in any empty room in any sector. there can only ever be 1 card in a pending card slot or an installed card slot. installed card rules take precedence over the general rules. there can only ever be 1 unit in a room. the number of tokens supplied defines the maximum number of such tokens that may be in the game. discarded token return to the available supply. game sequence players take their turns in turn order. a player’s turn consists of the following 4 phases: 1. movement phase choose one of your units from any sector and make a move. alternatively, move one of your units on a space field. a unit moves clockwise a number of sectors equal to the number of all units in the sector from which you start to move. you must move the exact number of sectors, though cards may modify movement. your moving unit may be placed in any empty room of your choice in the destination sector.ejection into space if there is no empty room in the destination sector, one of the units of your choice there is ejected and moved to the space field on the life and data points board. your ejecting unit takes its place. alternatively you may eject your own unit into space. if you move an enemy unit, you are still the ejector, even though you are not moving your own unit. since you then fill up the sector, after resolving any traps there you trigger a lesser onslaught. traps if there is an installed enemy trap card in the destination sector, that effect is resolved immediately after the move is finished. the active player chooses the order of resolution if there are multiple traps. some trap cards are resolved when you complete your move in the sector, but also when you pass through. crescent-shaped tokens are placed on the left side of the sector board as a reminder of these traps. lesser onslaught if your unit fills up the rooms of a sector, after resolving any traps, a lesser onslaught is triggered. if you moved an enemy unit, you still trigger the lesser onslaught, even though you are not moving your own unit. space field there is no limit to the number of units that can be on the space field spaces. units ejected to the space field remain there until their player chooses to move them. if you choose to move one of your units on a space field during your turn, move it to any empty room in any sector. no lesser onslaught is triggered if the sector is now full. your unit does nothing more (besides resolving any traps) and your turn ends. 2. action cards phase after finishing your move, resolve all the actions of all of your installed action cards in the destination sector. the active player chooses the order of resolution if there are multiple cards. 3. sector action phase perform the destination sector’s sector action. if you stop in an opposing player’s sector, you do not perform its sector action. 4. pending card phase you may take one of the following actions: a. if there are no pending cards (yours or your opponent’s), draw the top card from your deck and place it in the sector’s empty pending card slot. b. if there is an enemy pending card, discard it, replacing it with the top card from your own deck. c. if the sector contains your own pending card, install it faceup in any empty installed card slot in any sector. then immediately place the top card from your deck in the emptied pending card slot. this phase is not mandatory. however if you choose option b or c you must replace the card that you discard or install.when you install a card, you may discard one of your own already installed cards and install the new card in that slot. bonus cards you may install a card in an installed card slot occupied by a bonus card. if you do so, take the bonus card and use it right away or at any time on any of your future turns. the card is not replaced. bonus cards are kept visible to other players. sector actions corridors onslaught all your units in all sectors attack enemy units. the enemy units cannot attack back. tech bay additional turn choose another of your units in any sector and take an extra turn with it. this action is mandatory. during your turn, none of your units may move twice in any way. control room malfunction take the malfunction token from where it is currently and place it on any pending or installed card of an opponent, in any sector. it may be placed back on the same card. it cannot be placed on a bonus card. when the malfunction token is on a pending card, it cannot be installed or discarded by any player. when it is on an installed card, the card’s effect is ignored, the card cannot be discarded, and no upgrade token can be placed on it. it has no game effect. if the card has already introduced a token into the game, the token stays in effect. if the card has a supplemental token as a reminder of its effect (eg, fire, defense system etc), that token is removed. any upgrade token or card-related token on a card remains in place while the malfunction token is on it. faction sectors room you resolve the sector action only if it is your own faction sector. you have 2 options: upgrade token receive 1 upgrade token from the supply. base clean-up discard one of your enemy’s installed cards from your faction sector, removing it from the game. upgrade tokens upgrade tokens are kept visible to other players. a token can be used as follows: 1. you may discard 1 upgrade token to turn any of your units to its upgraded side. 2. you may place an upgrade token on any of your installed cards that has a number on an upgrade icon. each upgrade token on the card increases the number by 1. placement of the first token is free; to place another, you must first discard as many upgrade tokens as there are tokens already on the card. each card may have up to 6 upgrade tokens. 3. you may keep the upgrade token and use it as above any time during one of your future turns. you may use any number of upgrade tokens during your turn.onslaughts & wounds a unit attacks enemy units in the same sector only if the enemies are in attack range; ie, their rooms (spaces) are connected by passages (lines). a unit can attack up to as many enemy units as its attack limit (the icon on the unit): attack inflicts 1 wound on up to 1 enemy unit in attack range. attack inflicts 1 wound on each enemy unit in attack range. attack up to 1 enemy unit in attack range; the attack gives you 1 dp point instead of inflicting 1 wound. the faction that received the wounds immediately adjusts his marker on the lp track. each wound received (either as a result of enemy attacks or inflicted by traps) decreases your lps by 1. lesser onslaught when a fourth unit enters a sector and triggers a lesser onslaught, it is resolved in the same way as an onslaught, but only in the sector the fourth unit entered. winning the game when any player must place a card in a pending card slot but no longer has cards in his deck, instead move the end token on the final sequence track. this happens during pending card replacement, when a player has removed his opponent’s pending card, or installed his own card and must place a card in the emptied pending card slot. if the pending card slot is empty and the player has no more cards, there is no replacement, so the end token is not moved. the first time this occurs place the end token on the 3 space. the next time it happens move the token to the 2 space, the next time to the 1 space and, finally, to the dark end space. when the end token moves to the final space, the game ends immediately. players total their scores on the life points track and the data points track. the winner is the player with the highest total points. on a tie, each player takes an extra turn, starting with the player after the one who ended the game. if there is still a tie, the game ends in a draw and the tied players share the victory. other win conditions if the lps of any faction drop to 0, that player immediately loses the game. if any faction scores 20 dps, that player immediately wins the game. multiplayer 3 or 4 player deathmatch place the sector boards in any order: the order of the sector faction boards determines the play order. each player places their marker on the 0 space of the life points track. every time you wound an enemy (in any way), the wounds inflicted count as lps you gain instead of decreasing the enemy’s lps. the med bay card (scientists) decreases lps gained by the enemies instead of restoring the scientist’s lps. the scientist player divides the number of lps each player must lose. it is always the trap owner who gains the lps, even if a third player moved an enemy unit into the trap. when any player gains 20 lps or 20 dps, he immediately wins the game.on a tie, remove the markers of the tied players from the life and data points board. all other cards, units, and sectors belonging to these players remain and act normally. each of the tied players takes an extra turn starting with the player after the player who ended the game. if there is still a tie, the game ends in a draw and the tied players share the victory. 4 player team match players create 2 teams of 2 players. mark the alliances with alliance tokens: tokens placed vertically belong to alliance a players, and those placed horizontally belong to alliance b players. the order of the tokens indicates the turn order. players take their turns in the following order: 1. first player of alliance a. 2. first player of alliance b. 3. second player of alliance a. 4. second player of alliance b. during setup, each alliance chooses only 1 faction board for their alliance. each player shuffles his faction cards and takes the first 10 cards to form his deck. then each player draws the top 2 cards from his deck. in turn order, each player installs one of these cards faceup in any empty installed card slot in any sector, then places the other one in the pending card slot in the alliance sector. each player uses only 2 units. in turn order, each player places one of his units (base side up) in any empty room in his alliance sector. then, in turn order, each player places his second unit (base side up) in any empty room in any sector (if a sector is filled a lesser onslaught is not triggered). during the game, each player in an alliance treats the cards and units of his ally, and the alliance sector, as his own with the following exceptions: • you cannot move an allied unit (even with the additional turn action of the tech bay). • you can never draw a card from the allied player’s deck. • when an onslaught is launched, only the units of the player that launched it attack enemy units. bonus cards are shared by allied players. cards that make a player deal x more wounds during an onslaught or gain x more dps, affect the ally only when he actually inflicts the wounds or gains the dps. if during the game a player brings his opponent’s lps to 0 or scores 20 dps, his alliance immediately wins the game. if all players have more than 0 lps and less than 20 dps at the end of the game, the alliance with the highest total lps and dps wins. pandora faction pandora works best in a 3 player game. the faction consists of 3 standard units (creatures) and 10 smaller units (embryos): 2 catchers, 4 runners, and 4 warriors. there are no faction cards. at the beginning of the game the pandora faction has 20 lps as normal. it does not collect dps. pandora does not have a sector board. instead, the player places a pandora sector token on any sector board in the game (even an enemy sector). the sector is now also the pandora’s sector. if it is placed on an enemy sector, placing the token on the left or right affects the player order.creature base unit attack inflicts 1 wound on up to 1 enemy unit in attack range. upgraded unit attack inflicts 1 wound on each enemy unit in attack range. catcher base unit can permanently take over 1 enemy card. upgraded unit can permanently take over 1 enemy card. attack inflicts 1 wound on up to 1 enemy unit in attack range. runner base unit during its move may move 1 sector further. can take over 1 enemy card for a single use. upgraded unit during its move may move 1 sector further. can permanently take over 1 enemy card. attack inflicts 1 wound on up to 1 enemy unit in attack range. warrior base unit can take over 1 enemy card for a single use. attack inflicts 1 wound on up to 1 enemy unit in attack range. upgraded unit can permanently take over 1 enemy card. attack inflicts 1 wound on each enemy unit in attack range. budding each time a player moves a creature and it ends its move in a sector with no enemy units, 1 embryo is automatically born there (after resolving any action cards if pandora has taken over any). choose any available embryo token and place it in an empty room in the sector. if there is no empty room available, it ejects a chosen unit to the space field. taking over a card if a pandora player moves an embryo, then after the action card phase and after any possible budding, the player may take over an enemy card (and all upgrade tokens on it). place that embryo token on any enemy installed card in that sector; the token stays on the card and is no longer a unit. from now on the card is treated as a pandora card. the token indicates, depending on its upgrade side, whether the card has been taken over for a single use or permanently. if the card was taken over for a single use, after resolving the card the embryo is removed and returned to the available pandora tokens. the enemy card reverts to its original faction owner. the pandora player does not perform the pending card phase. pandora sector the pandora sector action is upgrade token (receive 1 upgrade token from the supply). it can be used as normal to upgrade any pandora unit, or can be placed on a taken-over installed card that has a number on an upgrade icon. if the pandora sector is a common sector, the pandora player performs its sector action as well as his upgrade token action (in an order of his choice). the common sector’s action is still available to other players. when the pandora player shares his sector with an enemy, the enemy can still discard taken-over pandora cards from their sector using the base clean-up action."

his second costs 2 cards of the same color; his third 3 cards of the same color.drawing train cards the colours of train cards match the routes between cities on the board. a player may have any number of train cards in his hand at any time. when the deck is exhausted, reshuffle the discards to form a new deck. locomotives locomotives are multi-coloured and act as wild cards that can be part of any set when claiming a route. they are also vital to claiming ferry routes. if a player selects a faceup locomotive card, it is the only card he may pick this turn. if a locomotive is turned over as a replacement for a first card drawn during the turn, or if a locomotive is available faceup but not picked up as the first (and only) card, it cannot be selected as a second card. if at any time, 3 of the faceup cards are locomotives, all 5 cards are immediately discarded and 5 new ones drawn to replace them. claiming routes a player may claim any route on the board, but only one route per turn. a route must be claimed in its entirety during a single turn. gray routes gray coloured routes can be claimed using a set of cards of any one colour. double routes some cities are connected by double routes (two tracks parallel along the entire route). one player cannot claim both routes. in 2 or 3 player games, only one of the double routes can be used. ferries to claim a ferry route, you must play a locomotive card for each locomotive symbol on the route, and the usual set of cards of the proper color for the remaining spaces. tunnels when attempting to claim a tunnel route, a player first lays down the number of cards required by the route’s length. then turn the top 3 cards from the train deck. for each card revealed that matches the color used to claim the route (including locomotives), an additional card of the same color (or a locomotive) must be played to successfully claim the tunnel route. if a player does not have enough additional matching cards, or does not wish to play them, he takes all his cards back and his turn ends. the 3 cards revealed for the tunnel are discarded. any locomotive card drawn automatically matches the color of the cards played on the route, and forces the player to add a card of matching color, or a locomotive.if a player attempts a tunnel by playing only locomotive cards, he will only have to play additional locomotives if they show up among the 3 cards drawn for the tunnel. drawing destination tickets destination tickets are kept secret until the end of the game and final scoring. a player may have any number of tickets at any time. if there are fewer than 3 tickets left, the player draws only what is available. once kept, tickets must be kept until the end of the game and cannot be discarded during a later ticket draw. a ticket is successfully completed if the player creates a continuous path of his trains between the 2 cities named on the ticket. building train stations a train station allows its owner to use one, and only one, route belonging to another player, into or out of that city to help him connect the cities on his tickets. 2 players may never build a station in the same city. only one can be built by a player per turn, and only 3 per player for the whole game. if a player uses the same station to help connect cities on the paths of several tickets, he must use the same route into or out of the city with the station for all tickets. which route does not have to be decided until the end of the game. game end and scoring when one player’s stock of trains is down to 2 or less at the end of his turn, each player, including that player, gets one final turn. the game then ends and final scores are calculated. reveal destination tickets. the value of successfully completed tickets is added to a player’s score and the value of incomplete tickets is subtracted from his score. add 4 points for each unplayed station a player has. add 10 bonus points to the player who has the longest continuous path of routes (the european express bonus). a given train can never be used twice in the same continuous path. stations, and the opponents’ routes they provide access to, do not count. if several players are tied they each receive the bonus. the player with the most points wins. if a tie, the player who completed the most destination tickets wins. if still tied, the player who used the least number of stations wins. if still tied, the player with the european express bonus card wins."

205,22825,TIDE OF IRON,2007,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,3.4563,572,"setup setup the map boards, map overlay pieces, markers and figures according to the scenario. players choose their nations. green bases are american and grey are german (in a 2 player game light/dark shades are ignored). each player shuffles and places face down in his hq area any specific strategy card decks granted by the scenario, then draws and places before him faceup cards as required from any of his decks. each player takes any operations cards (some affect both players) granted by the scenario. each player takes his initiative card and takes a supply of activation, condition and damage tokens. place the round marker on space 1 of the round track. players build squads by customizing their squad bases with a mix of scenario-provided infantry types. the scenario indicates which player starts with the initiative token and thus has the initiative. in order of initiative, place all starting units on the game board in deployment zones. squads may start deployed in transport vehicles. a single hex may contain up to three units, but never more than two vehicles. a unit may move through a hex full of friendly units, but may never end its movement exceeding a hex’s stacking limit. if a unit’s movement is stopped in a full hex, the unit is returned to the last non-full hex it moved from. in order of initiative, mark any units in opportunity fire mode with the activation token op fire side up. turn sequence the game is divided into game rounds, with each round divided into phases started by the player with initiative. 1. action phase players alternate taking the number of actions indicated by the scenario until neither player has actions left. advance activate strategy card concentrated fire assault prepare op fire fatigue unit fire and movement special action 2. command phase 1. determine control over objectives 2. receive command and victory points 3. spend command 4. determine initiative 3. status phase 1. draw strategy cards2. remove tokens 3. place units in op fire mode 4. squad transfers5. scenario reinforcements and events 6. advance the round markeraction phase most actions involve activating a single fresh unit (ie. one with no activation token) to become the active unit. when the unit has completed its action, it is fatigued (unless in op fire mode) and an activation token with the fatigued side faceup is placed by it. a fatigued unit, or a unit in op fire mode, may not be activated. advance a unit may move, its distance limited by its movement points (mps) and terrain. while moving, it may also be subject to enemy op fire, which may halt its movement. concentrated fire a unit may immediately make a concentrated attack against an enemy unit. the attack may be supported. prepare op fire place an activation token op fire side up by the unit. if an enemy unit moves within the unit’s los, the unit may interrupt the enemy unit’s movement and attack it, possibly supported by friendly units in op fire mode. fire & movement a unit may move and attack an eligible enemy unit, either moving then attacking or vice versa (a move may not be broken up with an attack), subject to these penalties: – a squad receives 1 fewer mp. – a vehicle receives 2 fewer mps. – a unit must halve its fpr value when attacking. – a unit may not make a long-range attack. – other friendly units may not support the unit’s attack. a unit that doesn’t attack still receives the move penalty. a squad containing any heavy infantry weapon figure may not be activated with this action. assault a squad may move with 1 fewer mp then make an assault attack against an adjacent hex containing one or more enemy units. a squad that doesn’t attack still receives the move penalty. vehicles, or a squad containing any heavy infantry weapon figure, may not be activated with an assault action. activate strategy card pay the command cost in command tokens and resolve an eligible faceup strategy card marked action phase. most strategy cards are removed from the game after being activated, but some have lasting effects. fatigue unit do nothing: fatigue a unit and proceed to the next action. special action special actions that require an action: as an action, do x. end of the action phase if a player can take no more actions during his action turn, or if he declares it to be over, his action phase is over and his opponent may take an unlimited number of actions until he has none.command phase 1. determine control over objectives check every objective hex (those with a command objective marker, a victory objective marker, or any indicated by the scenario). if control over an objective hex has changed, the new owner replaces his opponent’s control marker with his own. a player controls an objective if he has one of his control markers on that hex, or if he is now capturing the hex by having at least one friendly unit in it. he retains control of a hex as long as his control marker remains on the hex. command objectives command objectives are either nation-specific or neutral. a player may only gain command from controlling friendly or neutral command objective hexes. usually all objectives are controlled by neither player at the beginning of a game, though a starting unit may setup on an objective in its nation’s deployment zone. 2. receive command & victory points receive command for each friendly or neutral command objective a player controls, he receives the indicated amount of command tokens. receive victory points collect victory points as dictated by the scenario, using vp markers on the round track to keep track. when a player reaches 11 vps, flip the marker to its +10 side and move it back to the 1 space of the round track. 3. spend command each player may spend command tokens to activate strategy cards and increase their initiative pool (or other scenario-specific effects). a player may save up command to spend during a later round. activate strategy cards pay the command cost in command tokens and resolve an eligible faceup strategy card marked command phase. a player may activate as many of his available strategy cards as he can afford. most strategy cards are removed from the game after being activated, but some have lasting effects. increase initiative pool a player may place some or all of his available command onto his initiative card, where it can accumulate round after round. this command is then considered spent. 4. determine initiative the player with the highest amount of command on his initiative card claims the initiative token and has the initiative next round. if it is a tie, the token goes to the player who currently does not have initiative. in any timing conflict, the player with initiative decides the order in which to resolve effects.status phase 1. draw strategy cards each player draws one card from one of his strategy decks. if the first card drawn contains a + symbol, the player may immediately draw one additional strategy card (not during setup). no more cards can be drawn this round. 2. remove tokens 1. remove all activation tokens from the game board (including tokens from squads being transported by vehicles). all units are now considered fresh. 2. remove all condition tokens from pinned squads. 3. all disrupted squads now become pinned (flip the token). if there is an officer in the same hex, the condition token is removed instead. 4. remove any expired markers (eg. smoke). 3. place units in op fire mode players assign any number of their units to op fire mode. they cannot then be activated during the upcoming action phase, but they may react to enemy movement from the very first action of the next round. 4. squad transfers players may move any number of figures between friendly squads in the same hex. figures may not be transferred to or from a squad with a specialization; a specialization token may not be transferred; and figures may not be transferred to or from pinned, disrupted or transported squads or those in entrenchments or pillboxes. an empty squad base is removed from the game. 5. scenario reinforcements & events players receive any reinforcements and resolve any special events indicated by the scenario for this round. scenario reinforcements differ from strategy card reinforcements. placing reinforcements any reinforcements may only be placed in a nation’s reinforcement zone (marked with an r). reinforcements cannot exceed a hex’s stacking limits or be placed in a hex occupied by enemy units. any reinforcements missed in prior game rounds remain lost. 6. advance the round marker advance the round marker on the round track. another round begins. when the 11th round is reached, flip the marker to its +10 side and move it back to the 1 space of the round track. if the round just completed was the last round of the scenario, the game is over. winning the game different scenarios have different victory conditions. if, at the end of a victory point scenario, both players have the same number of vp, the player who has the initiative at the end of the status phase is the winner.movement a unit can only use its mps for moving/special actions if activated to advance, fire & movement, or assault. a unit may not move into or through a hex containing an enemy unit (except tank overruns). mps expended when entering a hex depend on the terrain of the hex. half hexes cannot be entered. moving and opportunity fire immediately after the active unit moves into any hex, op fire attacks by enemy units in op fire mode are resolved. if the active unit becomes pinned, disrupted, or damaged as a result of the op fire, it is immediately fatigued, and its activation and movement ends. if the attack scores no hits, or if a squad takes casualties as the result of a normal attack, the active unit may continue moving. a unit may be the target of op fire multiple times during the same movement, but not more than once per hex. a unit pinned, disrupted, or heavily damaged cannot be moved until the condition is removed. transporting squads in vehicles squads may be transported on vehicles with the transport trait. the number shows how many may be transported. the vehicle and squads count as only one unit for the purpose of stacking. use transport markers and their corresponding offboard indicator tokens. a squad may enter a vehicle in its hex for 2 mps. the squad is immediately fatigued and its action complete. fresh squads inside a vehicle may be activated, but cannot fire or resolve special abilities. vehicles do not benefit from bonuses or abilities of squads inside them. squads inside a vehicle cannot be targeted for any type of attack or affected by vehicle damage; only the vehicle can be targeted. if a vehicle is destroyed, all squads transported by it are also destroyed. an active squad may exit a vehicle for 2 mps, as long as it does not then exceed stacking limits. exiting may trigger enemy op fire. combat the range and firepower (fpr) of a unit are dependent on whether the target is an infantry or a vehicle unit. an attacking unit must be in range and have line of sight (los) to the target unit. if a hex contains multiple targets, and the attack is not an area attack or assault, the firing player indicates which exact squad or vehicle is to be the target of the attack. a squad is eligible to attack an enemy unit if at least one figure in that squad can do so. any figures that cannot participate do not contribute to the attack in any way. you may always choose to have some figures in a squad not participate in an attack. range compare the number of hexes to the target to the range value of the attacking unit. targets in adjacent hexes are at close range. if the distance is:– normal range: less than/equal to attacker’s range. – long range: greater than, to double, attacker’s range. – out of range: greater than double attacker’s range. the range is equal to that of the attacking figure in a squad with the lowest range, though not all figures in a squad must fire. there are 3 elevation levels: level 0 (most board hexes, grasslands, etc.), level 1 (low hill), and level 2 (high hill). an attacking unit on a hex of a higher elevation than its target receives +1 to its range value. line of sight there is a clear los if there is no blocking terrain (bt) on a straight line between the centers of the two hexes. bt does not block los to units in that hex. if the line between the units is traced exactly along the edge of a series of hexes, los is not blocked unless there is bt on both sides of the line. units do not block los. two adjacent units always have los to each other. if there is bt between units at different elevations, find the bt hex closest to the lower unit. a hill the same level or lower than the unit on the higher elevation is also considered bt. if the difference in elevation is 1, the 2 hexes behind the closest obstruction are blind hexes; if the difference is 2, the 1 hex behind the closest obstruction is a blind hex. there is no los if the lower unit is in a blind hex. if the higher unit must fire or be fired upon across an adjacent hex at its same level, there is no los. resolving an attack 1. determine attack strength fpr of attacking unit + half fpr of all supporting units the fpr of a unit depends on whether the target is an infantry or a vehicle unit, and is the cumulative value of every figure. 2. determine defense strength av of target + cover for terrain/fortifications only vehicles have armor values (av). effects that modify cover do not affect armor, and vice versa. 3. declare attack type if the target is a squad, declare the attack a normal attack or a suppressive attack. vehicles are immune to suppressive attacks. 4. roll attack & determine hits roll black dice equal to the attack strength and red dice equal to the defense strength. determine black dice successes, based on range: close range: 4-6; normal range: 5-6; long range: 6. subtract red dice successes, which are always 5-6. the final number is the number of hits. normal attack results against squads: remove figures equal to the number of hits. a pinned or disrupted status is not affected. against undamaged vehicles: 1 or 2 hits: lightly damaged; 3 hits: heavily damaged; 4+ hits: destroyed.against damaged vehicles: if a lightly damaged vehicle takes 1 or 2 hits: heavily damaged; 3+ hits: destroyed. if a heavily damaged vehicle takes 1+ hits: destroyed. a vehicle lightly damaged is -1 to movement and has -1 to its av. a vehicle heavily damaged may not move, has -1 to its av and its fpr is halved. suppressive attack results against a normal squad: 1 or 2 hits: pinned; 3 hits: disrupted; 4+ hits: routed and destroyed. against a pinned squad: 1 or 2 hits: disrupted; 3+ hits: routed and destroyed. against a disrupted squad: 1+ hits: routed and destroyed. combined fire when an active unit makes a concentrated or op fire attack, other fresh friendly units eligible to attack the target may support that attack with combined fire. a supporting unit must be in range and los of the target. the leading unit uses its full fpr and each supporting unit half its fpr. all participating units in combined fire become fatigued after the attack. the least favourable range of the participating units is used to determine the success number. opportunity fire a unit in op fire mode may attack during the opponent’s action turn when an enemy unit moves within its range and los. other fresh friendly units also in op fire mode may support the attack with combined fire. all participating units in op fire fire become fatigued after the attack. note that if a unit’s fpr would be halved more than once it cannot attack. always round up when halving fpr. area attacks area attacks affect all units in a hex, may be normal or suppressive, and succeed on 5 or 6. each individual unit rolls its defense dice and resolves its damage separately. assault attacks only squads without heavy infantry weapons figures may make assault attacks. they are always normal attacks. after movement, the assault attack is made against an adjacent hex containing at least one enemy unit that does not contain an enemy heavy vehicle. an assaulting unit entering a hex with a minefield or razor wire during its move may not assault that activation. up to 2 friendly squads in hexes adjacent to the target hex may support the attack, even fatigued squads (but not pinned or disrupted). 1. determine attacker’s attack strength fpr of attacking unit vs infantry + half fpr vs infantry of all supporting units 2. determine defender’s attack strength fpr of defending units and light vehicles vs infantry disrupted squads do not contribute, and pinned squads contribute only half fpr (unless an officer is present).3. roll attack & determine hits attacker rolls black dice equal to his attack strength and red dice equal to the defender’s terrain/fortifications. cover bonuses are cumulative. light vehicles do not contribute their av. determine black dice successes, on 4-6. subtract red dice successes, on 5, 6. the final number is the number of attack hits. 5. roll defense & determine hits defender rolls black dice equal to his attack strength. determine black dice successes, on 4, 5, 6. this is the number of defense hits. 6. resolve casualties the attacker first removes casualties from his active squad, then his other participating units. then the defender removes casualties from any combination of his defending units. hits may be assigned to a light vehicle up to the number required to destroy it. if the defender’s hits equal to or exceed the attacker’s, the attack is unsuccessful and the active unit fatigued. if the attacker’s hits exceed the defender’s, the assault is succcessful and the defender must retreat. the defender must move all surviving units into a single adjacent hex free of enemy units. destroy units in excess of stacking limits. if there are no hexes, destroy all units. disrupted units cannot retreat and are destroyed. pinned units become disrupted after retreating. the active unit and any supporting units may now move into the vacated hex and are fatigued. supporting units fatigued at the start of the attack may not advance. a retreat or advance does not trigger op fire. strategy cards any cards ‘placed in your play area’ are only paid for when initially activated and remain in effect from then on. establish contact (x) roll a die: equal or exceed the number to establish contact. another attempt may be made as an action once every subsequent round until successful. target hex place the target token on a board hex. determine drift if the target hex is not within los of a non-fatigued friendly unit, the drift number is 6. if within los, it is 4. if the unit is within los and contains an officer or the hex is in the same hex or adjacent, it is 3. roll 1 red and 1 black dice. if the black result is equal to/higher than the drift number the attack strikes the target hex. if less, the attack drifts as many hexes as the number on the black die, and in the direction on the north directional marker shown by the red die. the attack has no effect if the target drifts off the board. area attack (x) make an area attack against the final target hex using the strength given. if not designated as suppressive it is a normal attack. the attack scores successes on a 5 or 6 unless stated otherwise. wide blast radius (x) hexes adjacent to the target hex are attacked with the strength given. roll each separately.destructible buildings a scenario states in the terrain features whether it utilizes destructible buildings. to attack a building: 1. determine if the attacking unit is eligible to attack the building. the attacking unit does not count the firepower of regular infantry, elite infantry, officers, or machine gun crews. squads can still trigger charges which affect the building. 1a. target a building hex without a squad. a unit may target a building within range and in los. if there is no squad in the target building hex, use firepower and range used when attacking vehicles. 1b. target a building hex with a squad. a unit may target a building within range and in los. if there is a squad in the target building hex, the attacker declares whether his attack will target the squad (the building is unaffected) or the building (the squad will be unaffected unless the building is destroyed). when attacking the building, use the firepower and range used when attacking vehicles. 1c. hit a building hex with a normal area attack. if a building hex is targeted by a normal area attack, the building automatically has a chance to be destroyed (along with other possible targets). roll for the attack against the building separately after rolling for damage against any squads within. 2. roll for possible building destruction. include 2 red dice for the defense strength of the building hex. 3. assess whether the building has been destroyed. to destroy a building, the attack must deal 6 hits at one time. if not, the building sustains no damage. for buildings that take up more than one hex, a successful attack only destroys the targeted hex. if a building is destroyed, place a ruins token is on the building hex. the hex is now rough terrain. squads in a building when it is destroyed take 4 dice of damage, (4–6 are hits), and the squad is automatically pinned. surviving squads remain on that hex, as well as any tokens that were on that hex. if a scenario relies on control of a building hex for victory, the hexes till remain the objective.weather in scenarios that use weather, the setup rules describe how many of each type of card to include in a facedown weather deck. place a weather check token on each of the indicated rounds during setup to remind you when to check for weather changes. a weather check takes place before the action phase in the rounds that have a weather check token on the round track. shuffle the weather deck, including the currently revealed weather card (if any), and place it facedown. draw the top card, place it faceup on top of the deck, and then discards the weather check token from the round track. that weather card remains faceup until the next weather check. until that time, the new weather card effects are in effect for all players. commanders these rules may be used unless the scenario specifically that the commanders option must be used or ignored. commander cards allow each side to select a battlefield commander for that side. this commander allows that side to replace one of his strategy decks with one of that commander’s leadership decks. when you would normally draw a strategy card, you may instead draw a card from your chosen leadership deck. when leadership decks are used in a scenario, cards that affect strategy decks affect the leadership decks as well. 1. both sides must agree to use the commander cards. 2. each side chooses its commander card and leadership deck. the division 1 player of the side without initiative selects first, choosing his commander card and one of the 2 leadership decks listed on that card. a player may only select a commander of his nation. 3. the division 1 player of the side with the initiative card now makes his selection. if he selects a commander that uses the leadership deck already selected, he must use the other leadership deck. when deciding whether to use commanders, note scenario goals; eg, the air raider deck uses cards that can cause imbalance when the goal is to capture a particular hex. if the scenario calls for a particular card to be removed, then a leadership deck with that card should not be used.demolitions specialization a squad with the demolitions specialization can place and detonate charges to damage enemy units and buildings. charge tokens form a supply that any of that nation’s demolitions squads may use. the americans and the british use the green side and the germans use the grey side of the token. 1. place the charge. a demolitions squad can place a charge during one of its advance actions for 2 mps. place a charge token in the squad’s current hex (unless specified otherwise on an operations card) with the squad’s nation color faceup (the british use the americans’ green side). 2a. detonate the charge (action). detonate the charge using a fresh demolitions squad or a fresh squad containing an officer in los of one of that nation’s charges. as a special action, fatigue the squad to detonate the charge and apply damage to targets in that hex. you may not detonate charges that would damage friendly units. 2b. detonate the charge (op fire). detonate the charge by having a demolitions squad or squad containing an officer on op fire in los of one of that nation’s charges. as an op fire attack, fatigue the squad (even if a machine crew is present) on op fire to detonate the charge and apply damage to targets in that hex. you may not detonate charges that would damage friendly units. when detonating a charge, all charges in the targeted hex will detonate. 3. apply damage, as specified by the operations card governing the explosives used in a particular scenario or by the general charge stats. damage is automatic and considered an area attack (roll armor/cover dice as normal). damage affects buildings, vehicles, squads, and equipment. in a hex with a pillbox, the detonation will either affect all units outside or all units inside, depending on where the charge is placed (determined by where the demolitions squad was at the time of charge placement). the pillbox is not damaged.anti-tank guns all anti-tank guns have the equipment trait as follows: advance the unit can only move 1 hex, and must move with a friendly fresh unit (moving both units counts as a single action). concentrated fire this action can only be performed if there is a friendly squad, fresh or in op fire mode, in the same hex. the squad is not activated by the action. squads that are in an entrenchment (but not a pillbox) may be used to activate equipment in the same hex. equipment units may not perform f&m or assault actions. cover equipment units in the same hex as at least

hits and do not retreat. equipment units always count toward a hex’s unit limit.stealing equipment if an enemy unit is in the same hex as the equipment, it is treated as if it is a unit of their nation. equipment units do not prevent enemy units from moving into the hex. at gun special abilities fragile an at gun heavily damaged is destroyed. concussive firepower an at gun attacking a squad in a building or pillbox receives +3 fp and +3 range. minefields units must end their movement and become fatigued if entering a hex with a minefield and immediately roll for casualties: roll 4 dice:

207,268864,UNDAUNTED: NORMANDY,2019,OSPREY GAMES,2.2532,237,"setup a unit is a group of soldiers represented by 3 to 5 combat cards and a single combat counter, all with the same title and squad designation. choose a scenario from the scenario book (playing them in order is recommended). place the tiles as indicated and return unused tiles to the box. place the objective markers as indicated and return all unused objective markers to the box. both players choose a side and take all the cards, combat counters, control markers, and spawn markers indicated for their chosen side. place all tokens on the spaces indicated, ensuring they are the correct side up. return any unused spawn markers to the box. give the initiative marker to the side indicated. check the starting cards table for your side, take all the cards marked d (deck), shuffle them, and place the deck facedown in front of you. place all the cards marked s (supply) for your side nearby, faceup and sorted by card title. the content of your supply is open information. return all leftover cards for your side to the box. how to play play is in a series of rounds, each consisting of 3 phases. 1. draw cards both players draw 4 cards from their deck to form a hand. whenever you need to draw a card and your deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile into a deck. 2. determine initiative both players secretly select 1 card from their hand and reveal it simultaneously. the player who chose the card with the highest initiative takes the initiative marker and will perform actions first this round. on a tie, the player who has the initiative marker keeps it. both players discard their card. 3. player turns the player with the initiative marker plays cards from their hand, one at a time, into a play area in front of them. once they have no more cards in their hand they can or wish to play, their turn ends. move all cards left in their hand and all cards in the play area into their discard pile. you cannot save cards in your hand for future rounds. the player without the initiative then takes their turn. each card played can be used to do one of the following: • card action: perform one of the listed actions in full. • hunker down: return the card to your supply. fog of war you cannot play fog of war cards during your turn, but you can select one when determining initiative. the only way to remove a fow card from your deck is through a scout’s recon action. normally a fow card stays in your hand until the end of your turn, when discard it as normal.suppressed if a combat counter is facedown, that unit is suppressed and cannot perform actions. when you would have taken an action with a suppressed unit, flip the counter faceup to its ready side, but don’t take the action. place the card in the play area as normal. suppressed units can still hunker down , but doing so doesn’t flip the counter to its ready side. placing combat counters when you would take a card action with a combat card and the corresponding counter is not on the board, immediately place the counter on the board on the space with the relevant spawn marker. then perform the action as normal. do not place a combat counter when you hunker down . hunker down when you hunker down , return that card to your supply. it is then removed from the deck until you choose to take a bolster action to add it to your deck again. you cannot hunker down with fow cards. actions when an action’s name is followed by x, it means the action has a numerical value. when it is followed by xa, it means the action has a numerical value and may also have a squad (a, b, or c). movement actions move x move the unit’s combat counter up to x tiles. the tile you move onto must be scouted or controlled by your side. if you move your mortar combat counter, remove your target marker from the board. guide x move any combat counter up to x tiles. the tile you move onto must be scouted or controlled by your side. if you move your mortar combat counter, remove your target marker from the board. you cannot move a suppressed combat counter. scout x move the unit’s combat counter up to x tiles. if either tile you move onto does not have one of your control markers on it, place a control marker there on its scouted side. for each control marker placed, take a fow card from your supply and place it in your discard pile. if you need to take more fow cards than are available in your supply, take as many as are available. stalk x move the unit’s combat counter up to x tiles. the tile you move onto does not need to be scouted or controlled by your side. support actions bolster xa take up to x cards from your supply and add them to your discard pile. if the card specifies a squad, only cards from that squad in your supply may be taken. command x draw up to x cards from your deck and add them to your hand (they can be played as normal this turn). if your deck runs out of cards before you have finished drawing, shuffle your discard pile into a deck and continue drawing. conceal take a fow card from your opponent’s supply and place it in their discard pile. if there are no fow cards in their supply, this action has no effect. control take control of the tile that the unit’s combat counter is on by flipping the control marker to the controlled side. if your opponent controls that tile, flip their control marker back to its scouted side. if your opponent controls that tile and has a unit there, you cannot take control of the tile (so you may take control of a tile where your opponent has a unit, but only if they do not already control the tile). inspire xa choose up to x cards from your play area and add them to your hand (they can be played as normal this turn). if the card specifies a squad, only cards from that squad in your play area may be taken. recon choose a fow card from your hand and remove it from the game. then draw a card from your deck (which can be played as normal this turn). if your deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile into a deck and continue drawing. if you have no fow cards in your hand, you cannot take this action. target place your target marker on a tile 3 or more tiles away from your mortar combat counter. if your target marker is already on a tile, move it to another. if you move your mortar combat counter, remove your target marker from the board. combat actions attack x suppress x blast x when you perform a combat action: 1. choose target choose a target for the attack: attack or suppress : choose any enemy combat counter on the board. blast : all combat counters on the tile with the target marker are targeted, including any of your own counters. perform a separate attack against each combat counter on that tile, taking the steps below for each counter. if the target marker is not on the board, the blast action cannot be taken. 2. determine total defence value total the combat counter’s base defence (on the counter), the cover bonus of the tile the counter is on, and the range bonus (the number of tiles away from the attacking counter that the defender is, not including the attacker’s tile). no range bonus is applied to a blast action. 3. roll attack dice roll the number of dice equal to the value of the attack , suppress , or blast action. if any of the dice show a number equal to or greater than the defender’s total defence value, the attack is successful (how many successes does not matter). a die showing 0 is always successful, no matter how high the defender’s total defence value. 4. determine casualties if the attack is successful, you have inflicted casualties on the selected unit. your opponent must find a card from the attacked combat counter’s unit and remove it from the game.1. if possible, they must remove the card from their hand. 2. if they don’t have a card of that unit in their hand, they must remove it from their discard pile. 3. if they don’t have a card of that unit in their discard pile, they must remove it from their deck. they must then shuffle their deck. 4. if they don’t have a card of that unit in their deck, they must instead remove the combat counter from the board. you only ever remove 1 card after an attack, no matter how many dice were successful. you can always check cards that you have removed from the game. you cannot check your opponent’s removed cards. if the attack was a suppress action, no casualties are inflicted. instead, flip the attacked combat counter to its suppressed side. if it is already suppressed, the attack has no effect. hills some tiles have 3/1 listed as their cover bonus. these are hill tiles, which have a variable cover bonus. if a combat counter on a hill tile is attacked by another combat counter on a hill tile (whether the tile is the same or different), or if the attack is a blast action, the cover bonus is 1. otherwise, the cover bonus is 3. removing combat counters from the board as units suffer casualties, they may have their combat counters removed from the board. by bolstering them and later playing them, these units may return to the board. when a combat counter returns to the board, it is placed on the tile with the appropriate spawn marker, not the tile it was removed from. game end each scenario specifies the victory condition each side must achieve. as soon as it is achieved, the game ends immediately, without completing the round. the possible victory conditions are capturing objectives or pinning your opponent’s force. capturing objectives the scenario will specify the number of objective points required for victory. to claim this victory, the total objective points on all the tiles you control must equal or exceed the required total. pinning the enemy if your opponent has no riflemen combat counters on the board, you have successfully pinned the enemy. if both sides are pinned but neither side has won, the game ends and the player with the most objective points wins. in the case of a tie, the player with the initiative marker wins. beyond all hope it is possible that you can no longer win the scenario by scoring the required objective points. if this happens, you count as pinned. if your opponent’s objective is to pin you, they immediately win. if your opponent’s objective is to capture objectives, count how many objective points they currently control. if your opponent controls more than you, they immediately win. otherwise, keep playing until your opponent controls more objective points than you (at which point they win) or until they are pinned, at which point the winner is decided in the same way as when both sides are pinned."
208,163474,V-SABOTAGE,2016,TRITON NOIR,2.7097,62,"setup choose to play a quick game using a single terrain card, or an entire operation (2 to 5 terrain cards). a terrain is a series of tiles where the commandos must complete one or more objectives. if playing an operation, select 2 matching operation cards. choose a difficulty level: standard (ignore all special rules on the operation cards) or veteran (more enemies, and apply all special rules on the operation cards, including those with the symbol). place the terrain cards on the table as indicated by the operation card, along with the compass. build the terrain corresponding to the terrain card(s) in the left most position. all terrains must be facing north, matching the compass. special rules for an operation replace the objective of a terrain card if needed. the layout on each terrain card shows the tiles and tokens to set up. tile are small, medium or large, and each has an indoor (thick outlines and shading) and an outdoor (thin outlines and no shading) side. you may choose any tiles as long as the size, shape, and sides match those on the card. place the required tokens on the tiles. equipment tokens must be taken from their reserve. if the reserve doesn’t contain the tokens you are looking for, take the token from the discard pile. if one or more of the tokens are missing, players may choose which tiles or commandos will not receive them. place 1 regular enemy unit token with a mp40 (2 white squares on its token) on each token with a triangular shape so that it overlaps the triangular token. for a mg42 nest, place the token on its single space. if you play in veteran difficulty mode, add 1 enemy token with a mp40 on every tile in contact with an enemy entrance token. shuffle the event cards and place the deck facedown on the table. when a terrain card must be completed in a limited number of turns, create a separate event card deck made up of as many event cards as the turn limit and place it next to that terrain. when there are no more event cards to draw, you have reached the turn limit. if you draw an event card with the symbol, draw a new card from the main event deck until you get one with a direction. if the turns go on beyond the limit, draw event cards from the main deck. equipment reserve: the remaining equipment tokens (including the spotted tokens) in an opaque bag or a bowl. enemy reserve: the remaining regular enemy units (with mauser / mp40, 5 with sledgehammer and 7 ø tokens) and 3 special enemy unit tokens (black border) in another bag or in a bowl. special enemy units reserve: the remaining 7 special enemy unit tokens, on the table next to the enemy reserve. commando reserve: the commando cards and tokens in the box. each player selects a commando card and a side of the card (blue or tan) to use. keep the commando card (and its chosen side) as long as the commando stays alive. place your commando card in front of you with the 2 commando tokens with matching flags. one token is used when the commando is stealthy or visible, the other when the commando is in critical condition or wears a german uniform. place 1 equipment token corresponding to each transparent icon on the commando card. the total number of circles is the maximum number of equipment the commando can carry. transparent equipment slots can be used to hold any equipment token once the starting equipment token is used and discarded and the slot is free. blue opaque equipment on the card can be used without limit (they are not discarded after use), but cannot be exchanged between commandos or covered by another equipment token. when there are fewer players than the number of commandos required to play the operation, players may control more than one. in situations offering several options, the players concerned decide what to do. on the first game turn of an operation, bring the commando tokens into play: all commandos must spend 1 ap to perform their moving action (or 2 ap to move stealthily onto a medium tile ) in order to enter a tile containing an open trap door. game turn 1. event phase draw an event card for each terrain in play. place each drawn event card face up next to its terrain, where it remains until the end of the turn. unless otherwise stated, an event card affects only its terrain, and applies immediately. if an event card has different effects based on the alarm, apply the one that corresponds to the status of that terrain’s alarm when the card is drawn. to remind you about an event that takes place during the enemy phase, place the event card under an enemy entrance token. when the event card deck is empty, reshuffle the discarded event cards to create a new event card deck. 2. commando phase the commandos play in an order chosen by the players. each commando has 3 action points (ap) per commando phase, and each type of action has a cost from 0-2 ap. a commando must perform all their actions before the next commando (though it is possible to use some specific 0 ap actions later on). any ap not used during the commando phase are lost. a commando may perform the same action several times. actions costing 0 ap can be performed before or after (never during) an action performed by another commando, or before or after (never during) one of the enemy steps. as well as the special actions printed on their commando cards, commandos may perform the following actions: collecting or dropping equipment (0 ap) collect a green or blue (never red or orange) equipment token on the commando’s tile and place it on a free space on the right part of their commando card. a commando can drop an equipment token by removing the token from their commando card and placing it on their current tile. this action also includes giving, taking or exchanging equipment tokens with another commando on the same tile. blowing up a tnt charge (0 ap) blow up a red tnt charge anywhere on the commando’s terrain. moving (1 ap) move your commando onto an adjacent tile with a free space. diagonal movement is forbidden. there must also be an opening (an unlocked door or no walls) along the edge between the departure tile and the destination tile. walls without an unlocked door (around indoor tiles) are usually impassable. the number of circles on a tile is the maximum number of characters it can contain. there must be at least 1 free space on the destination tile for a commando to move onto. equipment and small triangular tokens (alarms and objectives) do not use a space on tiles. a mg42 nest uses 2 spaces on a tile, though the nest itself has only 1 space.this action may also be used to enter a tile through an open trap door (as in when they enter the first tile of an operation): place the commando on the tile containing the trap door. a stealthy commando that enters a tile containing enemy units, must perform a stealth check. moving stealthily onto a medium tile (2 ap) move your commando onto a medium tile while remaining stealthy. otherwise, this type of movement is the same as moving . this movement may also be used to become stealthy when entering a medium tile through an open trap door. exiting through a trap door (1 ap) leave the terrain through an open trap door on the commando’s tile. after exiting, a commando can no longer perform another action, but must wait for the next turn to act again. place the commando token on the table (out of the terrain). now between 2 trap doors, the commando is unaffected by enemy units and event cards and cannot interact with other commandos. while between 2 trap doors, the only available actions on the following turn are moving or moving stealthily onto a medium tile , to enter a tile through an open trap door on any terrain. a commando exiting an open trap door keeps all the tokens on their commando card. visible commandos exiting through an open trap door are considered to be leaving the tile and suffer reaction fire from each enemy unit on their departing tile. if the commando is in a critical condition, they are then eliminated. unblocking a trap door (1 ap) unblock a blocked trap door on the commando’s tile (flip the trap door token to its unblocked side). a commando between 2 trap doors cannot unblock a blocked trap door. attacking in close combat (1 ap) a close combat attack can only be performed by a stealthy commando on the same tile as the targeted enemy unit. attacking in close combat is an automatic success. return the enemy unit token to the enemy reserve and replace it with 1 equipment token randomly drawn from the equipment reserve. this token is placed on its green, blue, or orange side (never on the red side). shooting (1 ap) use a firearm or a grenade to target a tile containing enemy units. shooting with a firearm (not a grenade) may also target a locked door to open it. complete the following steps for every shot before taking another shooting action. 1. declare a shot: choose the weapon on the commando card to use, then select a target (tile or locked door) within range (the tile where the shooter is, and every orthogonally adjacent tile not blocked by a wall or locked door). to shoot a locked door, the commando must be on one of the 2 tiles it separates. 2. shoot: roll a number of dice equal to the number of white squares on the weapon token being used. the minimum score to hit with each die is indicated on the targeted tile. if the targeted tile contains a character located in a mg42 nest, they may only be hit by 5+ (as indicated on the nest token). if one of the dice targeting a tile with a nest is 5 or 6, you may decide to target an enemy unit in the nest. shooting a locked door is an automatic success: flip the door token on its unlocked side. 3. shooting results: each successful die roll causing a hit eliminates 1 enemy unit. the shooting player decides how to distribute successful hits if there are multiple enemy units on the targeted tile. a shot never hits an objective. a commando shot never hits another commando. extra successful hits are lost.4. reward after elimination: after every shot, all eliminated enemy tokens are returned to the enemy reserve and simultaneously replaced by the same number of equipment tokens randomly selected from the equipment reserve. place each token on its green, blue, or orange side (never on the red side). using equipment (1 ap) use an equipment token on the commando’s card. a visible or stealthy commando on a tile with enemy units may use equipment. interrupting an alarm (1 ap) switch off a triggered alarm if the commando is on the same tile and stealthy: flip all orange alarm and enemy entrance tokens to their black side. this action may only be taken once per terrain. if the alarm is triggered again on this terrain, permanently flip the alarm and enemy entrance tokens to their orange side. ensure that all commandos on the terrain are stealthy: if anyone is visible, the alarm will be immediately triggered again. interacting with an objective (variable ap) interact with an objective token if the commando is on the same tile. some objectives require the use of an equipment token to interact with it. others may require a specific interaction, as indicated on the terrain card. once an objective is completed, its token is removed from play. saving an action (1 ap) spend 1 ap, take a +1 ap token, and place it on the dedicated space of your commando card (+1 ap tokens cannot be placed on -1 ap spaces on commando cards). a commando can save as many ap as there are dedicated spaces to store them on the commando card (never more). commandos may keep these tokens as long as they wish, until used or removed by injury. using a +1 ap token costs 0 ap and must be used following the same conditions as an action costing 0 ap, however the commando may execute any action requiring 1 ap. discard the +1 ap token after use. you may combine 1 or several ap with a +1 ap token (and even 2 +1 ap tokens for the sapper commando on his blue side). 3. enemy phase players control enemy units during the following steps. the enemy phase takes place even if there are no commandos on the terrain. 1. enemy reinforcements step randomly take a handful of enemy tokens from the enemy reserve and place them in a small pile with random sides faceup. drawing from this pile, place 1 enemy unit token on every tile that is in contact with an enemy entrance token. if the alarm is triggered, place 2 enemy unit tokens on each tile. return the remainder of the pile to the enemy reserve if necessary. if there are not enough enemy unit tokens in the reserve to place all the required units, the operation fails and the players lose. you may look at the enemy reserve at any time to to see how many enemy unit tokens remain. if the tile does not have enough free spaces, or if the enemy entrance is barricaded, place the enemy unit tokens on the table (outside the terrain) right behind the corresponding enemy entrance token. commandos cannot perform actions against enemy units on the table. these units will enter during the following enemy reinforcement step, if possible. where only some of these enemy units may enter, the players select the units that will enter and the ones that will stay outside. if enemy units enter a tile containing a stealthy commando, the commando must immediately perform a stealth check.when a ø enemy token is placed on the terrain or on the table, do not place an enemy. at the end of the enemy reinforcement step, permanently return all ø enemy tokens from the terrain or the table to the box. then, for each ø token removed this way, add 1 token from the special enemy unit reserve to the enemy reserve. 2. enemy movement step 1. for each terrain, all enemy units follow one of these rules to determine direction: – toward the nearest visible commando by the shortest path. – if all commandos are stealthy, in the direction defined by the cardinal point at the bottom of the event card drawn at the beginning of the turn for that terrain. the direction determined at the beginning of the enemy movement step is enforced for the whole step, whatever happens. 2. move enemy unit tokens to the adjacent tile in the specified direction on each terrain: – toward the nearest visible commando: move each enemy unit by taking the shortest path. – in the direction indicated by the cardinal point at the bottom of the event card: move enemy units in this direction (using the compass placed on the table). always move the enemy units nearest to the direction or visible commando first, followed by the enemy units furthest away. enemy units can move through locked doors, but not through trap doors. if the symbol at the bottom of the event card is , draw a new event card and apply this new card’s direction, then discard it (ignore its event). ignore and discard cards with the same symbol until you get a direction. an enemy unit does not move if: – there is no tile in this direction, or a wall blocks the way. – they are protecting a triangular token. – they are on a tile containing a visible commando. – the destination tile already contains the maximum number of characters. if a group of enemy units have a choice of several paths to follow, split them into as many groups of the same number as there are possible paths, choosing the types of enemy units in each group. then move each group toward their different destination tile. players decide which group gets an odd unit if there is one. any time an enemy unit moves onto a tile with an unprotected triangular token, they automatically protect it and will not move again. slightly overlap the triangular token with the enemy unit token, or if it is a mg42, place the unit on the space on the nest (neither is considered a movement). only 1 enemy unit at a time can protect a token; additional enemy units entering the tile can leave the tile freely. special enemy units never protect a triangular token. 3. enemy shooting step all enemy units on the same tile are considered a single enemy group focussing all their shots on the same tile. declare a shot each enemy unit shoots once and only if they have a visible commando within range. a stealthy commando can never be targeted nor hit by a weapon involving a dice roll. when shooting, each enemy group gives priority to: 1. their own tile. 2. an adjacent tile. if an enemy group can target several adjacent tiles with visible commandos, players decide which is targeted. shoot take as many dice as the total of white squares on all enemy unit tokens in the group that is shooting. if an enemy unit is in a mg42 nest, use the number of white squares on the mg42 nest instead of the squares on their enemy unit token.roll the dice: each result equal or higher than the number on the targeted tile hits a visible commando on that tile. for each hit, place a -1 ap token on the commando’s card. if several visible commandos are on the targeted tile, players choose how to distribute the hits. when a commando is in critical condition because of received injuries (all spaces of their commando card occupied by -1 ap tokens), attribute the remaining hits to any other visible commandos on the same tile. all extra hits are lost. 4. end of turn phase check for operation success or failure: operation success the operation is a success when these 2 conditions are true: – all objectives of all terrains of the operation have been completed and – at least 1 living commando got out of the last terrain through a trap door. operation failure the operation fails if any one of these conditions occur: – all commandos have been eliminated or – there are not enough tokens left in the enemy reserve to place all the enemy units needed or – a failure condition on a terrain card or an operation card has occurred. start a new game turn if the operation is neither a success nor a failure. if a new turn must begin, discard the event card(s) drawn at the beginning of the previous turn. commando health there are 4 health statuses for a commando: healthy all commandos are healthy when starting a new operation. injured when a commando is hit, place a -1 ap token on their card on the uppermost left slot that does not already have a -1 token. if that slot already contains a +1 ap token, flip it to its -1 ap side. each -1 ap token on a commando card immediately makes them lose 1 ap, as well as during all future commando phases. as long as the top slot on the commando card is occupied by a -1 ap token, the commando cannot save any +1 ap tokens. critical condition a commando is in critical condition when all their card’s slots are occupied by -1 ap tokens. replace the commando token with their critical condition token. a commando in critical condition may only perform actions with 0 ap cost and remains on the tile waiting to be healed. enemy units ignore commandos in critical condition (who are considered stealthy). if no one heals the commando before the end of the next game turn, a commando in critical condition is eliminated . a commando in critical condition in a mg42 nest can be moved freely into another free space on the same tile. eliminated a commando is eliminated in the following situations: 1. the commando was in critical condition and was not healed before the end of the next game turn. 2. the commando is on a tile hit by an explosion ( ). 3. the commando suffered a special operation rule that eliminates commandos. after elimination, take a randomly selected commando card from the reserve in the box. choose the side to use (blue or tan). do not place any equipment tokens on the card’s transparent icons.discard the eliminated commando card and 2 tokens. their equipment tokens remain on the tile where they were eliminated (unless they were eliminated by a , in which case all the equipment tokens are destroyed and placed in the equipment discard pile instead). if there are no more commando cards left, shuffle the eliminated commando cards to form a new reserve. when a new terrain is set up after a commando’s elimination, the player that was in control of the eliminated commando may order their new commando to enter any terrain. therefore a player controlling a commando eliminated on the last terrain of an operation will not be able to return to play. stealth stealthy characters are invisible to the enemy. they can never be targeted or hit by a weapon requiring a dice roll, and they can perform lethal close combat attacks. the two sides of a commando token indicate whether they are stealthy or visible. to become stealthy, a commando must move onto a tile that allows hiding. a commando entering a small tile becomes automatically stealthy. a commando entering a large tile becomes automatically visible. a commando entering a medium tile can either become visible if they performed the moving action or become stealthy if they performed the moving stealthily onto a medium tile action. a visible commando cannot become stealthy if there is at least 1 enemy unit on the tile they want to move onto. only commandos and some escorted characters can become stealthy. enemies are always visible. a commando not in a stealthy state is visible. you can be visible on a terrain even if it does not contain an enemy. enemy units move towards the nearest visible commando on their terrain, and will target them if in range. a visible commando entering or leaving a tile containing enemy units immediately suffers reaction fire. commandos become immediately visible if any of these occur: – they shoot with a weapon that has the symbol on its token. – they move onto a large tile. – they move onto a medium tile (unless they used the moving stealthily onto a medium tile action). – they fail a stealth check. – a spotted token is placed on a tile containing at least 1 other enemy unit. stealth check as soon as a stealthy commando enters a tile containing one or more enemy units, they must perform a stealth check. roll 1 die per enemy on the destination tile. if at least one of the dice results is 1 or 2 (the eye icon), the commando becomes visible. when one or more enemy units enter a tile, any stealthy commando on that tile must perform a stealth check by rolling 1 die per enemy unit. reaction fire reaction fire occurs each time a visible commando enters or leaves a tile containing enemy units. every enemy unit on the departure tile and on the destination tile performs reaction fire immediately. roll the dice for enemy shooting targeting the departure tile of the targeted commando, then attribute the injuries to the commando. for each wound received, they lose 1 ap immediately. no matter the results of the dice, the commando makes the move as initially planned. a stealthy commando who becomes visible by entering a tile with enemy units does not suffer any reaction fire. a reaction fire always targets a tile; never a mg42 nest that a targeted commando left or is about to enter.alarm the alarm on a terrain is immediately triggered if: – any equipment token with the symbol is used. – there is at least 1 visible commando on the terrain; – the players use more commandos than the quantity for this terrain (as indicated on the bottom-right of the terrain card). once the alarm is triggered, flip the alarm and enemy entrance tokens on the terrain to their orange sides. a triggered alarm on a terrain means more enemy unit reinforcements. the only way to stop a triggered alarm is to perform the action interrupting an alarm . an alarm remains triggered even if all commandos are stealthy again or if there is no commando on its terrain. an alarm cannot be destroyed or moved by the commandos. escorting a character if the objective of a terrain card requires escorting a character, as soon as a commando reaches the objective token, replace this token by the token of the character to be escorted, on its stealthy side if possible (on a large tile, they are visible). the token of the character to be used is printed on the terrain card. a character to be escorted: occupies 1 space on the tile (there must be 1 free space on the tile to replace the objective token with the escorted character token). does not have any ap. may follow a commando on the same tile when the commando performs 1 of these actions: moving , moving stealthily onto a medium tile , or exiting through a trap door . is eliminated at first hit. does not benefit from the special skills of the commando who is escorting him. is removed from game after leaving a terrain. there are 3 types of escorted character tokens: stealthy / stealthy (black borders): always stealthy, the character is ignored by the enemy units. stealthy / visible (plain side/alarm side): can choose between being stealthy or visible (all commandos’ stealth rules apply). visible / visible (2 alarm sides): always visible; the enemy units move towards this character and try to eliminate him like a visible commando. an enemy escorted character does not require a commando entering his tile to perform any stealth check. completing a terrain a terrain is completed when its last objective is completed and no commando remains on that terrain. at the end of the commando phase, for every completed terrain: 1. flip the terrain card to its completed side. 2. dismantle the completed terrain. discard all remaining equipment tokens and return enemy unit tokens to the enemy reserve. 3. at the beginning of next turn, if the completed terrain card is linked by to another terrain card (or by to 2 other terrain cards) on its right, set up these terrains. if 2 terrain cards are linked by to another terrain, you must complete these 2 terrains to open access to the next terrain. 4. during the commando phase, any commando who exited through a trap door in a previous turn can now enter a new terrain through an open trap door. when leaving a terrain, commandos keep all their equipment, german uniform, and -1 ap/+1 ap tokens."
213,47185,WARHAMMER: INVASION,2009,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,2.733,427,"setup 1. choose and shuffle decks players may either use the prebuilt decks and each add 10 random neutral cards; or use constructed decks; or build decks using the draft variant. 2. set up capital boards each player selects the capital board that best suits his deck, and places it on the playing area in front of himself. 3. set up token pool place the resource, burn, and damage tokens in a pile in the centre of the table for the use of both players. 4. determine first player the first player is determined randomly. 5. draw setup hand each player draws 7 cards from his deck as his starting hand. if you do not like your hand, you may shuffle your 7 cards back into your deck and draw a new starting hand (“taking a mulligan”). you must keep this second hand. turn sequence each player completes his entire turn before the other player takes his turn. a player’s turn is divided into 4 phases, taken in order. during the very first turn of the game only, the first player must skip his entire quest phase and his entire battlefield phase. this is the “first player penalty”. 1. kingdom phase (collect resources) the active player resets his resources by returning all of his unused resources to the central pile and then taking one resource for each power in his kingdom (the kingdom starts with a base power of 3). he also has the opportunity to restore any single corrupted card under his control at the beginning of his kingdom phase, before any player actions can be taken. then, both players have the opportunity to take actions (including using tactic cards). once both players have chosen not to take an action, play proceeds to the next phase. 2. quest phase (draw cards) the active player draws one card for each power in his quest zone (the quest zone starts with a base power of one). then, both players have the opportunity to take actions (including using tactic cards). once both players have chosen not to take an action, play proceeds to the next phase.3. capital phase (play units, supports, quests) the active player may play unit, support, and quest cards from his hand to his 3 zones. to play a card from his hand, he must pay for it by spending (returning to the central pile) resources equal to the card’s total cost. he then chooses where (amongst his 3 zones) the card is placed. a card’s cost is the sum of its printed cost (the value in the upper left hand corner) and its loyalty cost (the number of loyalty icons under the printed cost minus the number of matching race symbols the player controls in play). each capital board has one race symbol for the race it represents. a card’s loyalty cost cannot be less than 0. the active player also may play one card face down as a development, at no cost, in any one of his zones. a development adds 1 hit point (hp) to the zone in which it was played. each zone starts with 8 hps. developments in a zone only add hps to that particular section of the capital. you may look at your developments (but not at your opponent’s) at any time. a player is considered to be taking an action when playing a unit or support card from his hand (or when playing a card face down as a development) during the capital phase. the other player may still take actions (use tactic cards or trigger card abilities) during this phase. once both players have chosen not to take an action, play proceeds to the next phase. sending a unit on a quest quest cards are played from a player’s hand into his quest zone in the same manner that unit and support cards are played. once a quest card is in play, the controller of that card has the option of sending his units on that quest. to do so, he plays the unit on top of the quest card when he plays that unit from his hand. the questing unit is still a part of his quest zone (it contributes power and can be used to defend the zone when it’s attacked), but it is also considered to be questing on the quest upon which it was played. a questing unit allows resource tokens to be accumulated on the quest, and once the specified number of resources have been accumulated on a quest, its effect can be utilized. these tokens come from the central pile, and are not subtracted from resources collected during the kingdom phase. resource tokens on a quest card cannot be used for anything other than the effects of that card. only one unit can be questing on a quest card at a time. if the questing unit leaves play for any reason, the quest card remains but all resource tokens accumulated on it are discarded to the central pile. 4. battlefield phase (attack opponent’s capital) the active player may attack one of his opponent’s zones with any number of units in the active player’s battlefield. the defending player then has the option of defending that zone with any number of his units stationed there. any time a section has as many (or more) damage tokens as it has hps, the section is burning. all damage tokens on that section are immediately replaced with a burn token. players have the option of taking actions (use tactic cards or trigger card abilities) after each of the 5 combat steps, and play does not proceed to the next step until both players have chosen not to take an action. 1. declare target of attack the active player declares which of his opponent’s 3 zones he is attacking. 2. declare attackers the active player decides which of his units in his battlefield (if any) are going to participate in the attack. only unit cards in the battlefield can be declared as attackers. 3. declare defenders the defending player now decides which of his units in the attacked zone (if any) are going to defend the zone. only unit cards in the attacked zone can be declared as defenders. defending units do not block particular, individual units; the attackers all attack together and the defenders all defend together. 4. assign damage both players determine how much damage their participating units inflict. each counts the number of power icons on the units he controls that are participating: this is the amount of damage he will be inflicting upon his opponent. the attacking player assigns damage to his opponent first. the attacking player must assign enough damage to destroy each defending unit before any damage can be assigned to the defending player’s capital. more damage can be assigned to a unit at the attacker’s discretion, in anticipation of the toughness keyword or other damage cancellation effects. damage tokens are placed near the card(s) to which the damage is being assigned, and if any damage reaches the capital, damage tokens are placed next to the attacked section, but not yet applied. then the defending player assigns the damage inflicted by his defenders to attacking units. damage tokens are placed near the card(s) to which the damage is being assigned. the defender may also over-assign damage to any attacking unit, in anticipation of toughness or cancellation effects. defenders cannot assign damage to an attacker’s capital. 5. apply damage both players now apply the assigned damage to the cards to which it has been assigned. effects like toughness may kick in and cancel damage before it reaches the target. any damage tokens thus cancelled are returned to the central pile. any unit that has as many (or more) damage tokens on it as it has hps is destroyed and discarded. end of active player’s turn this is the end of the active player’s turn. the other player now becomes the active player, and starts his turn with the kingdom phase. play proceeds with the turns alternating until one player has won the game.game overview the game is played in 3 zones: the kingdom, the quest, and the battlefield. the first player to burn 2 of the 3 zones on his opponent’s capital board wins the game. there are 6 different races: order (empire, dwarf and high elf); and destruction (chaos, orc, and dark elf). order and destruction cards cannot be combined in a deck. cards with a grey border and no racial symbol are neutral, are not race-specific, and can be used in both order and destruction decks (unless specified otherwise). a constructed tournament deck must have a minimum of 50 cards, no more than 100 cards, and no more than 3 copies of any card. there are 5 different card types: unit cards, tactic cards, quest cards, support cards, and draft format cards. cards marked with a banner are unique. if you have a unique card in play you cannot play, take control of, or put into play (via a card effect) another copy of that card. both players may have the same unique card in play at the same time. if a unique card is in your discard pile, you may play another copy of that unique card as normal. cards attached to another card are discarded if the card they are attached to leaves play. if the rules text of a card contradicts the rulebook, the rules on the card take precedence. a player who at any time has no cards in his deck is immediately eliminated from the game. card effects actions “action:” triggers are always optional and can be triggered during an action window in the game sequence. the card on which the action is printed must be in play (unless specified otherwise). tactics cards are actions that are played from a player’s hand. actions can also be played or triggered in response to other actions. it is then resolved before the action it is responding to. if there is a chain of responses, resolve the final response first and work back to the original action. all costs must be paid and any targets chosen when the action is triggered, whether or not the effect resolves immediately. once paid for, that effect is part of the action chain and resolves even if the source of the effect is removed from play. forced effects “forced:” triggers occur automatically and immediately when triggered by specific occurrences. they cannot be cancelled or interrupted by other actions. constant effects card effects without a bold trigger are constant effects and continually affect the game as long as the card is in play and any other conditions are met. zone specific effects card effects preceded by an italicized zone name are only active when the card is located in the specified zone. corruption when a card becomes corrupt, the card’s controller turns it 90 degrees. corrupt cards cannot be declared as attackers or defenders. “cannot” an effect with the word “cannot” in its description means that effect is absolute and cannot be overridden by other effects.other rules control and ownership players “own” cards in the deck they are playing. players “control” cards they own, unless another player steals control of the card through a game effect. a card leaving play reverts to its owner’s hand, deck, or discard pile (as directed by the effect forcing it out of play). corresponding zones a card referring to an opponent’s “corresponding” zones is referring to each opponent’s zone of the same name as the zone in which the card is located. if a card refers to each player’s corresponding zone, it is referring to the zone in which the card is located as well as each opponent’s zone of the same name. sacrifice the card is placed in its owner’s discard pile. a sacrifice cannot be cancelled by other effects. non combat damage outside of combat, some card effects also deal damage to units or to a player’s capital. when these effects resolve, the damage is applied as soon as it is assigned before any other actions can be taken. counterstrike damage is always applied as soon as it is assigned, however. legends you play legend cards directly from your hand onto your capital board during your capital phase. the board must have a matching loyalty icon. this is considered taking an action, but cannot be played in response to another action. legend cards are not affected by card effects that target unit, support, or tactic cards. each player may only have 1 legend card in play at a time. you may not play another until the one you control leaves play. a legend’s power icons are split between the battlefield, quest, and kingdom zones, contributing during the relevant phase as if it were located in those zones. in the battlefield phase, it may use its power to attack as if it were a unit in the battlefield zone, and can deal and receive battlefield damage as though it were a unit (but cannot be targeted by card effects that target units). attacking a legend during the battlefield phase, the active player may attack his opponent’s legend instead of his opponent’s capital. he first declares which zone he is attacking, then whether he is attacking that zone or a legend through that zone. he then declares attackers as normal. the defender may then declare defenders. only units in the defending zone can defend a legend. if any units are declared as defenders of a legend, enough damage must be assigned to destroy each defending unit before any damage is assigned to the legend. a defending legend contributes the power it has (as damage) in the zone to the battle. if a legend is dealt damage equal to or greater than its hit point, it is destroyed.draft variant create 2 draft piles: place all of the dwarf (1–25), empire (26–50), and high elf (51–55) cards in one pile, and all of the orc (56–80), chaos (81–105), and dark elf (106–110) cards in another. add the 3 order treaties to the order pile, and the 3 destruction treaties to the destruction pile. shuffle and deal out 10 of the neutral (111–119) cards to each of the piles. then add one set of 10 draft format cards to each draft pile. one player takes the order pile and the other player takes the destruction pile. these are the sides each player will play for this game. each player then shuffles his draft pile. each player takes the top 15 cards of his draft pile, forming his first draft pack. looking at the cards, each player picks 2 cards and places them face down in front of himself: these are the first 2 cards of his deck. the players then trade draft packs, and each counter- drafts one card from his opponent’s pack, thereby denying his opponent the opportunity to use that card in his deck. the draft packs are again traded, and each player picks 2 more cards and adds them to his deck. this continues, with each drafting player picking 2 cards each time his pack is passed to him and counterdrafting one card each time his opponent’s pack is passed to him. a player will pick 2 cards from his pack 4 times, and he will counterdraft a card from his opponent’s pack 3 times. after a player picks 2 cards from a pack for the fourth time, that pack is done. the remaining cards are discarded, and each player makes a new draft pack of 15 cards from the draft pile. once 5 packs have been drafted by each player in this way, the draft is complete, and the players can now play a game with their decks. draft format cards these effects do not themselves go into a player’s deck; they resolve completely when they are picked from a player’s draft pack or when they are counterdrafted from the draft pack of his opponent. they are revealed to an opponent, and they take effect before moving on to the next step of the draft. cut supply lines the selecting player places this card next to his opponent’s draft pile. for the remainder of the draft, that player draws one less card each time he creates a new draft pack. reinforcements the selecting player sacrifices this card and then looks at the top 5 cards of his draft pile. he adds one of those cards to his deck and places the other 4 cards at the bottom of his draft pile. sabotage the selecting player places this card faceup next to his deck. any time that player is counterdrafting a card from his opponent’s pack, he may sacrifice this card to counterdraft an additional card from that pack. shifting tides this card is immediately sacrificed. then, the pack from which it was selected is shuffled back into its owner’s draft pile and is replaced with an equal number of cards. if this card is picked simultaneously with another draft format card, shifting tides always resolves first. if a pack runs out of cards before a player can pick 8 cards from it, that pack is complete. the player building from that pack resumes adding cards to his deck when both players create the next set of draft packs."
214,1634,WARHAMMER QUEST,1995,GAMES WORKSHOP,2.6882,170,"setup each player chooses the warrior he is going to play and takes the appropriate warrior card, an adventure record sheet, the warrior model, and the warrior’s starting equipment: the lantern for the barbarian, the rope for the dwarf, the healing potion for the elf and the hand of death scroll for the wizard. each player rolls their starting wounds (their maximum for the game) and writes the number on their record. a 1 may be rolled again, but the second result must be kept. the wizard shuffles the spell cards into their 3 decks (attack, defense and healing) and chooses 1 card randomly from each deck. then roll d6 and take that many power tokens. a 1 may be rolled again, but the second result must be kept. sort the board sections into 3 piles: dungeon rooms, objectives and corridors. take the 3 card decks (dungeon, event and treasure), remove the 5 objective room cards from the dungeon deck, shuffle each deck and place them face down on the table. pick 1 objective room card at random; the rest are not used. roll d6 to select an adventure from among those featuring that room in the adventure book. draw 6 dungeon cards and shuffle in the objective room card, then deal 6 more dungeon cards on top of these. the remaining dungeon cards are not used. turn the top card from this 13 card dungeon deck and place the corresponding board section in the middle of the table with the doorways attached as indicated. place the leader model on any square and the rest on the board, on any square, in initiative order from highest to lowest. the rule of 1 and 6: when making a dice roll, despite any modifiers, a natural 1 always fails and a natural 6 always succeeds. sequence of play 1. power phase the wizard rolls for his power level that turn. unexpected events may occur. 2. warriors’ phase warriors can move, fight monsters, and explore. 3. monsters’ phase monsters on the board may move and fight. 4. exploration phase warriors may try to see what is beyond an unexplored doorway. 1. power phase wizard’s power the wizard player rolls 1d6 to determine his power level for the turn, indicating it with a small red die in the current power box on his card. at the end of a turn any used power is lost. unexpected events if the wizard player rolls a 1, turn over the top card of the event deck and follow the instructions. if the wizard is dead, another player rolls this die to see if there is an event. events (e) are resolved immediately. monsters (m) mean the warriors have been attacked: take the indicated number of monsters and put them on the board. placing monsters the first time monsters appear the leader places them; then the player to his right, and so on. a group of monsters must always be shared equally as possible among the warriors. position each model facing the warrior it is attacking. different types of monsters must be shared evenly as well. if there are monsters that cannot be divided equally, draw warrior counters randomly to allocate them. if there are no spaces left next to warriors, place remaining ones as close as possible on empty spaces on the same or an adjacent board section. if the warriors have split up onto different board sections, draw a warrior counter to determine where the monsters appear and place them on that board section. monsters armed with missile weapons are placed as far away as possible from the warriors on the same or adjoining section, but still able to see their target. models with missile weapons can only shoot at targets to which they have line of sight (los). determine los by drawing a line between the centres of the firer’s and target’s squares – if this passes through a wall, the los is blocked. monsters and warriors do not block los. 2. warriors' phase beginning with the warrior and followed by the elf, wizard and dwarf (leader followed by descending initiative order), each player takes a turn. if the players are missing the barbarian, one of the other warriors must carry the lantern and be the party leader. if the barbarian is killed another warrior takes it and becomes the leader. the lantern illuminates the section the leader is on and all adjacent sections. any warrior moving beyond this is lost and removed from the game. moving and fighting a warrior may move a number of squares in any direction up to his move (m), and then attack a monster in an adjacent square. he may not move through another model or obstacle, and may not move diagonally between squares if one of the adjacent squares between them is a wall. warriors must halt when they move next to a doorway that leads to another section. when a warrior moves onto a new section for the first time and completes his movement, his turn ends. the warriors may leave the dungeon via the entrance if they wish. a warrior may not fight a monster in an adjacent square and shoot at it in the same turn. pinning a warrior is pinned and may not move if there is a monster in an adjacent square at the start of the warriors’ phase. a warrior may not use a missile weapon while pinned. he may however turn to face any direction. to escape from pinning and move normally a warrior must roll a die and score at least his pinning value (only one roll is required no matter the number of pinning monsters). 3. monsters' phase when a new dungeon room (objective rooms have special rules)is entered for the first time, draw a card from the event deck. events (e) are resolved immediately. if monsters (m) are revealed, take the indicated number of monsters and put them in the room (even if the warriors are split up). if there is not enough space, leftover monsters may be placed in adjoining board sections. share monsters equally among warriors as usual. once they have been placed, their turn is over and they cannot move or fight until the monsters’ phase of the next turn. monsters placed in the power phase of the current turn can move and fight, however. moving and fighting monsters always attack the warriors. – if pinned, a monster stays where it is and fights. – if it has a missile weapon and can see a target, it shoots. – if it has a missile weapon but cannot see a target, it moves to see one and then shoots. – if it does not have a missile weapon or has one but cannot move to see a target, it moves toward a warrior, and attacks him if it can. monsters move and attack by dividing up among the warriors as equally as possible, the same as for initial placement. they move in the same way as warriors and are pinned in the same way, but cannot escape from pinning. the first attack rule monsters placed to attack a warrior will always try to fight that warrior when they make their first attack. if the warrior has moved away, the monster will follow and attack if it possibly can. once this first turn is over, the normal rules are used for determining who a monster attacks. 4. exploration phase only the leader can explore, and only if there are no monsters on the board section the leader is on, and the leader is next to a doorway leading to an unknown part of the dungeon. the leader player declares he is exploring and takes the top card of the dungeon deck. take the appropriate board section and clip it to the doorway. warriors are not obligated to enter the new section. dividing ways if you find a t-junction, place it as normal, then divide the dungeon deck, dealing out one card at a time to each corridor from the bottom of the deck until you have 2 separate decks. if the warriors run out of cards or reach the end of one route without finding the objective room, they must retrace their steps or abandon their quest. combat combat may last several turns; work through the power, warriors’ and monsters’ phases as normal until the monsters are killed. hand-to-hand combat a model may fight any opponent in an adjacent square; turn the models to face each other. if a model has multiple attacks (a) he may strike several times in a turn. a warrior may split the atacks between 2 or more enemies. a monster must use all of them against one warrior. roll 1d6 and score equal or over the number shown on the model’s combat table versus the enemy’s ws. if the strike is a hit, roll 1d6, add the attacker’s strength, and subtract the opponent’s toughness. some weapons and monsters cause extra damage, and armour may add to an opponent’s toughness. shooting a model with a missile weapon may only shoot if he is not adjacent to (and therefore not pinned by) an enemy. he must have los to the target and can only shoot once a turn.roll 1d6 and score equal or over the model’s ballistic skill (bs) value, or the value on the monster’s event card. if the shot is a hit, work out wounds the same way as for hand- to-hand combat, but use the strength of the weapon. when more than one monster shoots, work out how many hits there are before dividing them equally amongst eligible targets, drawing warrior counters for any odd hits. death and unconsciousness when a monster is killed, place it on the adventure record sheet of the warrior who slew it. record wounds on monsters still alive by using a small die next to the model. when a warrior’s wounds are reduced to 0 he is unconscious; place the model on its side. if he is not healed by the end of that turn, he dies and the player is out of the game. deathblow if a warrior kills a monster with a single blow and there is another monster standing adjacent to it and still in attack range, roll to hit and wound the second monster as normal. if it is killed the blow can carry on to another monster, and so on. spellcasting the wizard may cast any of his spells any time in a turn by expending power equal to the spell’s casting number. attack spells can only be cast during the warriors’ phase (but even during another player’s turn). you may never interrupt a hit however. a wizard’s power tokens can be used for extra power, but once used they are gone for the rest of the game. gold and treasure once the combat is over, players can trade in the monsters they killed for their value in gold (as indicated on the event card). once all outstanding events are completed, the warriors receive a treasure card for each event, unless otherwise indicated on the card. treasures must be shared out equally. any left at the end of the adventure can be traded in for their value in gold. when a warrior is killed all his gold and treasure cards ar lost. his starting equipment card may be taken by another player. equipment and treasure the items of starting equipment that each warrior carries may be used at any time. to use an item on another warrior, the models do not have to be next to each other or even on the same section. warriors can also find and use treasure cards during the game. armour, a shield or weapons can be used immediately. armour or weapons cannot be lent to other warriors, but they can be given to other warriors at the end of a turn if there are no monsters on the board. a warrior can carry as many items as desired, but only one set of armour, shield, and weapon can be used during any one turn. winning the objective room is the final goal of the warriors; do not take an event card, but follow the instructions in the adventure book. once the adventure is complete, players cash in any treasure cards they have left for gold, and count their treasure. all the warriors win by completing the adventure, but the amount of gold won by each warrior is the measure of individual success."

action cards (12), control markers (12 and baron markers (8). regular troops (3x50 and 1x100), 1 random 50 mercenary and 1 random 100 mercenary. assign all troops to nobles and/or stronghold by placing the cards under the noble and stronghold cards. 2. place 10 influence per player in the influence area. 3. if fewer than 6 players, choose the required number of cities to raze by drawing cards from the fate deck. 2 players: 11 razed kingdom cities 3 players: 7 razed kingdom cities 4 players: 5 razed kingdom cities 5 players: 3 razed kingdom cities place city models on remaining cities. 4. shuffle the agenda, mercenary and neutral action decks and place them off the board. shuffle the fate and event decks and place them on their spaces on the board. place the top card from the event deck at the bottom of the deck. 5. draw (#players +1) mercenary cards and place them faceup near the mercenary track. draw 3 agenda cards and place them faceup on the current agenda spaces. 6. randomly choose the chairman of the assembly and the head of the church and give them their tokens. 7. starting with the chairman and going clockwise, each baron places his stronghold on any kingdom space that does not contain an unrazed city or another player’s stronghold. in a 2 or 3 player game, strongholds may only be placed in the 16 central hexes. 8. starting with the last player to place a stronghold and going counterclockwise, each player places one noble who has been assigned troops in any kingdom space that does not contain another player’s noble or stronghold. if instructed to ‘randomly choose’ a result, draw fate card(s). if a deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck. all tokens are considered unlimited. money and favors may be traded freely between barons during the game (vote or faith tokens, influence, charges, offices and troops may not be traded).game round 1) planning each player places 2 of their action cards facedown into each of 3 different stacks (he may place fewer into each stack), then places each stack on one of the 3 action card spaces on the board. the chairman then shuffles the neutral action cards and shuffles 2 cards into each stack. 2) actions the chairman reveals and reads aloud the top card in the first stack and it is resolved and allocated. this continues until the first stack is empty, then the same is done for the second and third stacks in that order. 3) upkeep 1. check for victory if any one baron controls more than half of the unrazed cities in the kingdom (excluding overseas cities) he immediately wins. 2. gain influence each baron gains 1 influence for each city he controls (excluding besieged cities). he may not gain influence if his stronghold is not on the board. all barons gain their influence, even if extra tokens must be taken from outside the pool. if all influence is taken, the game ends after this upkeep phase and the baron with the most influence wins. 3. revolts for each city a player owns without one of his nobles in the area, draw a fate card. if the card says revolt the city becomes neutral unless the baron pays 1 faith or twice the city’s income in crowns. 4. sea movement arrivals all nobles traveling by sea arrive at their destination. 5. refresh nobles flip over all exhausted noble cards. 6. return nobles to the board troops can be transferred between nobles in the same area, and nobles off the board may be brought into play. actions if the action card belongs to a baron, he takes one of the actions listed. he may decline to carry out an action, but the card is still allocated to one of the special phase areas. neutral cards are read aloud and resolved by the chairman, then returned to their deck. once resolved, action cards are placed in the special phase area listed. if an area now has (#players x2) cards the phase for that area is triggered and carried out entirely before another action care is revealed. 1) levy taxes the baron receives 1 crown for each area (in the kingdom and overseas) occupied by one or more of your nobles. nobles on a port do not count. 2) draft soldiers place a baron marker on any free space on the mercenary track with a number no higher than number of players, for free. if the number of markers is now one more than the number of players, the mercenary draft is triggered. if the wages phase is also triggered after allocating this card, carry it out before the mercenary draft.3) rally support the baron gains 2 votes. if he has more votes than any other baron he becomes chairman of the assembly. 4) serve the church the baron gains 1 faith. if he has more faith than any other baron he becomes head of the church. 5) mobilize forces choose an area. move one or more unexhausted nobles there (following movement rules), start a battle there, or do both. nobles that move and/or attack are then exhausted. if both actions occur the baron chooses which area to place the card in. 6) versatile action perform any one action listed on the card. the card is then returned to the owner’s hand. the listed fee must be paid if he puts a marker on the mercenary track. neutral actions 1) important event the head of the church has the power to choose a player to draw and resolve the top event card. if the card is blue (neutral) anyone may draw the card. if the card is red (harmful) the head of the church can draw the card himself or spend 1 faith to choose another baron to draw it. if the card is green (beneficial) the head of the church can spend 1 faith to draw the card himself or choose another baron to draw it. any baron (unless the card is red, in which only the baron who drew it) may pay the amount of faith listed on the card to cancel and discard some events. if the cost is more than one, multiple barons may combine to pay. if an event card requires a fate card to be drawn to determine a random target, it may be cancelled after the fate card is drawn and the target determined. 2) fund expedition 1. chairman may start an expedition (if he chooses). the chairman chooses an expedition not currently underway and each player, starting with the chairman, may invest up to 5 crowns and place them under a baron marker on that expedition. the head of the church may bless the expedition by paying 1 faith and placing it on the expedition. an expedition marker is then placed on the 1 spot. 2. all other expeditions move forward one spot on their respective expedition tracks. 3. if an expedition marker is on the 3 spot draw a fate card (if the expedition is blessed, draw 2 and choose the better result). 4. determine the fate of the expedition: no news: expedition stays on the 3 spot. another fate card will be drawn next time fund expeditions is chosen. fleet lost: remove the expedition marker; all invested money goes to the treasury. 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x: the original investment is multiplied by the listed multiplier and paid out to each baron.3) upgrade defenses starting with the chairman and proceeding clockwise, each baron may repair or fortify one city he controls. repair: pay 2 crowns per breach counter removed. multiple tokens may only be removed from one city. fortify: pay 4 crowns to flip the control marker to the fortified side. strongholds may not be fortified. 4) muster troops starting with the chairman and proceeding clockwise, each baron may remove casualty tokens from one army at the cost of 2 crowns per token. 5) uncertain times shuffle the fate deck. special phases when a special phase is triggered it is completely resolved before the next action card is revealed. after the phase, return all cards in the area to their owners. 1) taxation barons receive income (shown under the city’s name on right) for all cities and concessions they control (fortified cities 1 additional crown; besieged cities provide none). 2) wages starting with the chairman and going clockwise, all barons pay wages (shown in the lower right of each troop card) to the treasury. regular troops must be paid first, even those assigned to a baron off the board and those with casualties. regular troops do not desert if not paid but as many must be paid as possible. maintained troops from an office do not need to be paid. all unpaid mercenary troops desert and are shuffled back into the mercenary deck. a baron may choose not to pay a mercenary troop. 3) assembly the barons must vote on 3 agendas. all barons not banned from the assembly or unable to attend because of a charge must attend. 1. receive votes each attending baron receives 1 vote token plus 1 for each kingdom city he controls (this is open information). 2. appoint acting chairman if the current chairman is not present, he appoints an acting chairman. 3. vote on all private motions any private motion agendas are voted on. draw a fate card to randomly choose a baron (present or not), who may force a vote to: – rescind a baron banned from the assembly. – discard one law, charge or office currently in effect. – postpone the assembly. if this vote passes, the assembly ends and the current agendas are voted on next assembly. – a vote on any agenda in the discard pile.4. declare agenda order the chairman chooses the order in which the 3 current agendas will be put to vote. he reads them aloud in that order. 5. vote on each agenda the attending barons hide a number of votes in hand and simultaneously reveal them. starting with the chairman and proceeding clockwise, barons declare how they are casting their votes (yes / no or choosing a specific baron). votes are discarded after use. the chairman may break ties in any way he chooses, regardless of how he voted. motions: take effect immediately and are discarded laws: placed face up on the table and remain in effect unless removed by a private motion. charges: assigned to a baron who can have up to 3 at a time. if this is the fourth, he chooses one of the original 3 charges to discard. office: assigned to a noble by a baron. it replaces any previous office and is removed if the noble dies. a baron need not be present to be assigned a charge or office, but if he has been banned he may refuse them without penalty. 6. reveal 3 new agendas 4) mercenary draft in baron marker order on the mercenary track, left to right, each baron has the option to hire one of the available mercenary troops for a fee equal to its wage. if a baron has more than one marker anywhere on the mercenary track and there is more than one troop of the same nationality available, he may hire them at the same time, losing as many markers off the track as the number of same nationalities he hired. these do not need to all be assigned to the same noble or stronghold. mercenaries are assigned to a noble located at a baron’s city or stronghold; a noble that is currently off the board; or the baron’s stronghold. all remaining mercenaries are shuffled back into the deck, baron markers are removed from the track, and (# of players +1) new cards are drawn and placed faceup next to the track. movement a noble may move only one area, or 3 areas if on a road for the entire move. mountainous borders are impassable and rivers may only be crossed at bridges. areas containing another baron’s noble or city are impassable unless allowed by that baron. after a noble has moved and/or attacked, flip over the noble’s card to indicate he is exhausted. he may not move or attack, but must still defend if attacked. at any point during movement, a noble may receive troops from his stronghold, or from an unexhausted noble, in the same area. if troops are transferred out of an army with casualty tokens all of the army’s troops must be transferred. if noble starts his move in an area with a port he may move to any other port icon and is then exhausted. during the upkeep phase, move any nobles on a port icon into the area with the port. they are then refreshed and may move/attack that round.battles after playing a mobilize forces or versatile strategy action card, a baron must have at least one noble in an area with an opposing noble, city or stronghold to start a battle. he must choose one baron as defender if there are several opponents’ armies there. the defender may be a neutral city. the attacker may choose which of his armies led by unexhausted nobles will fight. all of the defender’s troops in the area take part. any defending noble in an area with a city his baron controls is considered to be in the city. a noble on a port cannot attack or be attacked.a baron may only assault or siege a city if it is neutral and he is the only baron with armies in the area; or he gains permission from other barons with armies in the area; or the city is controlled by another baron and he is the only other baron with armies in the area or the city is controlled by another baron and he gains permission from the other barons with armies in the area. 1) open field battles 1. declare commanders first the attacker and then the defender choose one noble present as commander, and whose special ability and +200 strength will be used. other nobles have no effect on the battle. 2. draw fate cards (limit 10 per player) each baron draws one card per 100 strength (troops + commander bonus - casualties). since each side has a noble with a +200 bonus, discard facedown to the bottom of the fate deck 2 cards (or more if desired) if left with none, keep one. 3. reveal fate cards resolve any draw 1 fate cards. tally casualties, taking into account noble’s special abilities if desired, and assign 1 casualty token for each 100 casualties. the defender may wait to assign casualties second. if equal to or more than the number of troops in the army, the noble leading that army dies. if at least one noble from each side survives count victories: full victory: one side has 2 or more battle victories than opponent. any opposing nobles are killed. partial victory: one side has one more battle victory than opponent. any opposing nobles retreat. stalemate: same number of victories. nothing happens. 4. resolve noble deaths (if any) 2) city assault follow the same procedure with the following changes: 1. city strength the defender adds the city’s strength to the strength of his defending armies. he draws fate cards equal to the total. if the city is neutral, a player draws cards based on its strength only. there is no commanding noble, so do not discard 2 fate cards. 2. breaches some casualties may be taken as breach tokens (one per 100 casualties) instead of casualty tokens. a city can take breaches equal to its strength, and breaches remain on a city after a battle.3. capturing a city a city is captured if all defending nobles are killed, the city strength is reduced to 0 and the attacking noble survives; or if there is a full or partial victory. if the latter, defending nobles must retreat to an adjacent area. place a control marker underneath it to show the new ownership of the city. 3) city siege follow the same procedure with the following changes: 1. the total strength of the attacker must be greater than the defensive strength. nobles’ special abilities are not used, though the +200 bonus is. place a siege token on the city. if a second siege is made against the city by the same baron in a future game round (without the siege being lifted in between attacks) the city is taken. all defending nobles are killed. 2. in a besieged city a noble may not move, transfer troops, or receive additional troops during the upkeep phase or the mercenary draft. the city may not be fortified or repaired, and it does not generate influence during the upkeep phase or generate income during the taxation phase. nobles in a besieged city may attack the sieging armies in an open field battle. 3. a siege is lifted and the token removed if the sieging nobles are killed or forced to retreat or the attacker leaves the area for any reason. if the sieging armies’ strength is reduced in between the 2 siege attacks, the siege is not lifted. if a city is taken by assault or siege it may be immediately razed for 3 times its normal income. remove the city model and any control marker. razed cities cannot be controlled by any baron. fortified cities a baron places his control marker under a city when he gains control of it, fortified side down unless the city was already fortified. a fortified city only loses fortified status if it becomes neutral. if it is reduced to 0 strength via breach tokens, it becomes unfortified and 1 token is removed, so that the city is still at 0 strength. attacking a stronghold strongholds are attacked in the same way as cities. a defender may have troops without a noble there (in which case do not discard 2 fate cards). the battle ends immediately if the stronghold’s strength is reduced to 0 and any defending troops are killed. if a baron eliminates an opponent’s stronghold, he takes half of his crowns (rounded down) and gains control of one of his cities of the defeated baron’s choice. the stronghold is then removed from the board and the defeated baron does not gain any influence during the upkeep phase of this round. in the upkeep phase he may place the stronghold back on the board on any kingdom area that does not contain a unrazed city or an opponent’s noble or stronghold. retreats an army may not voluntarily retreat from battle. if forced to retreat:1. draw for deserters draw 1 fate card. if the army has mercenaries of the indicated nationality, the baron must choose one mercenary troop of that nationality to be shuffled back into the mercenary deck. 2. move retreating armies even exhausted nobles retreat. move them to an adjacent area (not necessarily the same area) that does not contain any city or other baron’s nobles. if there is no such area, the noble is exhausted and placed at his baron’s stronghold (he dies if the stronghold is under siege or off-board). a army may not retreat via sea movement; a noble forced to retreat from an overseas area dies. noble death when a noble dies: 1. draw for deserters in the same way as for retreats. 2. lose casualties for every casualty token on his army, the noble must discard 100 strength worth of mercenaries, or as many as possible if he hasn’t enough; then discard the tokens. regular troops are never discarded as casualties. 3. remove the noble and discard any offices he held. 4. heir the same game piece may be placed on the board during the upkeep phase and takes control of any remaining troops. if he has no heir, his mercenaries are shuffled back into the deck and his regular troops are removed from the game. returning nobles to the board the chairman of the assembly performs this procedure first, then other players in clockwise order. first, a baron may transfer troops among nobles currently off the board. then, any troops currently assigned to a stronghold may be assigned to the off-the- board noble. if they have casualty tokens on them, all troops and tokens must be transferred, or none at all. finally, any off-the-board noble with troops assigned to him must be placed at a baron’s stronghold or any unbesieged city he controls. a noble without troops may never be placed on the board. winning the game if any one baron controls more than half of the unrazed cities in the kingdom (excluding overseas cities) they immediately win (5 cities in a 2 player game). if all influence is taken, the game ends after that upkeep phase and the baron with the most influence wins. barons who should receive influence after the pool is depleted still receive it. ties are broken by number of cities, then highest total of crowns + faith + votes, then the player with most troops. if there is still a tie there is no king and no winner. assembly voting for 2 players after the order of agendas is declared, each player secretly writes down the number of votes he wishes to cast (up to the number of votes he has) for each of the 3 agendas. they are then revealed simultaneously and each order resolved in order."
216,244654,WILDLANDS,2018,OSPREY GAMES,2.125,88,"setup choose a map to play on. each player chooses a faction and a colour, taking the matching cards, miniatures, bases and crystal shards. clip the coloured bases onto your miniatures. put your character cards and faction card faceup in front of you, and place each miniature on the corresponding character card. shuffle your action cards and place them facedown in front of you as your personal action deck. shuffle the map cards and deal 10 to each player (each has a number matching a map space). choose 1 card for each character by placing it facedown on that character card: this is the space where that character will first appear. you may check these at any point, but keep them secret from other players until your characters are revealed. once everyone has assigned a map card to each character, pass the 5 remaining cards to the player on your right. place your shards on the map spaces matching these cards, then remove the cards from the game. once everyone has placed their shards, draw 7 cards from your action deck to form your hand. the player whose shard is on the lowest-numbered space goes first, and takes the active player token. your turn on most turns, you reveal 1 character, take as many card actions as you like, and then draw 3 cards. the player to your left then begins their turn. each crystal shard you claim is worth 1 point, and each enemy character you knock out is worth 1 point. the first player to collect 5 points wins. 1. r e v eal ch a r a cter if you have one or more characters still on their character cards at the start of your turn, you must reveal at least one. flip over its assigned map card, place the miniature on the matching map space, then remove that map card from the game. you may reveal more characters at any point should you wish. you cannot be interrupted directly after revealing a character.2. ca r d pla y on your turn you may play as many action cards from your hand as you like, one at a time (unless climbing to high ground or collecting a shard). each action card has multiple ways it can be used. when playing the card, you select 1 option, and forgo the chance to use the others. character icons (in the scales) indicate which characters you can use to move, or to collect shards. flags indicate actions those characters can take instead of moving or collecting shards. after you perform an action, leave a small pause to give other players the opportunity to play an interrupt card. you can only take actions using characters who are on the board. if you wish to take an action using a character not yet on the board, you must reveal them first, then take the action. place your used action cards in a personal discard pile. if your deck ever runs out of action cards, shuffle your discarded cards to form a new deck. 3. dr a w ca r ds once you want to stop playing cards and revealing characters, declare that you are ending your turn. now draw 3 new cards from your action deck, no matter how many cards you played this turn. you may only draw up to 7 cards in hand. pass the active player marker to the player on your left, who then begins their turn. you may be interrupted after you declare the end of your turn, but before you draw cards. after the interrupting player is finished, you may decide whether to draw cards or continue playing. de fault ac t i ons you can take these actions with a character whose icon is on a card, regardless of any action flag beside it. move movement is the default action of a card. if a character’s icon is on an action card, you may always use the card to move that character. one card will move a character to an adjacent space. there is no limit to the number of characters that can occupy a space, and other characters do not affect your movement. you can move between spaces separated by white lines, but not through walls.climb if a white line is marked with an arrow, that points toward high ground, which you need to climb to access. to move a character in the direction of the arrow you must play 2 cards which allow movement for that character. this additional cost only applies when moving in the direction of the arrow; moving downwards against the direction of the arrow only requires 1 card. you may use a wild movement instead of a normal movement at any point. claim sh a r ds you can only claim crystal shards of your own colour. you can claim a shard even if there is an enemy character in the same space. you must have a character in the same space as the shard, then play 3 cards displaying that character’s icon as a single action. alternatively, you may play 3 cards with icons matching one other character who is already knocked out. you cannot mix the icons of different characters: it must be 3 of a kind. when you claim a shard, place it in front of you as 1 point. a wild movement can count towards any set of 3. fla g a ctions flag actions are usually connected to a character icon. you can always use a character’s flag action instead of a default action. flags are grouped by colour: melee (red), ranged (blue), defence (green), and manoeuvres (yellow). a breakdown of which action each character can take is on your faction card. at the bottom of some cards are open actions, which are not associated with a particular character symbol. any single revealed character may take that action, in defence or attack, instead of the other options on the card. this cannot be used to take a default action. when a character takes damage, place the matching number of damage tokens on their character card. if the number of tokens equals or exceeds the health number, they are knocked out. flip the character card facedown and return the tokens to the supply. the last player to injure the character takes the miniature. if a character is knocked out by other means, remove it from the game (no player earns the point). you cannot target your own character with a ranged or melee attack.melee deal 1 damage to an enemy character in the same space. if there are multiple enemies from the same faction in the space, the player who controls them can choose which one is being targeted. if there are multiple enemy factions present, choose one faction to attack. when another player performs a melee or heavy melee attack against this character, you may take this action out of turn to prevent all damage from that attack. hea v y melee deal 2 damage to an enemy character in the same space. if there are multiple enemies from the same faction in the space, the player who controls them can choose which one is being targeted. if there are multiple enemy factions present, choose one faction to attack. this action cannot be used in defence. ra n g e d at tac k deal 1 damage to an enemy character within los . if there are multiple enemies in the same space, you may choose which one is targeted. hea v y r anged a tt a ck deal 2 damage to an enemy character within los who is not more than 2 spaces away from the character taking this action. if there are multiple enemies in the same space, choose which one is targeted. area at tac k choose a space adjacent to your character, or choose the space the character occupies. deal 1 damage to every revealed character in that space, including characters you control. this is the only attack which can target high ground from lower ground. shield when another player performs a ranged, heavy ranged, or area attack against this character, you may play this card out of turn to prevent all damage from that attack. if multiple characters are being hit with an area attack you must play a separate card for each character. you may also play this card immediately after an area attack you have made, to prevent your own character from taking damage. this action does not defend against melee attacks. c ove r when another player performs a ranged or heavy ranged attack against this character, you may play this card out of turn to prevent all damage from that attack. this can only be used if the defending character is in a space containing cover (the core number is a white number in a black circle). this action does not defend against melee or area attacks.ra l ly this symbol means you can move both the specified character and another of your characters, following the normal move rules. the 2 characters must be in the same or adjacent spaces at the start of the action, but can move in completely opposite directions if you choose. you may choose to move just 1 of the characters. if you wish to use this symbol to climb with either character, you must play additional cards as normal. the rally counts as a card for both characters, so 2 valid rally cards, or 1 rally card and 2 cards which allow individual movement, would allow both characters to climb. this counts as 1 action for an interrupt. f ly move this character up to 2 spaces. you may ignore the movement rules relating to high ground when flying. wild a ctions all wild action cards are identical, and each can be used to perform 1 of the following 3 actions. wild mo v ement this can be used as though it shows every character icon from your faction, so you may move any of your characters 1 space. it can be used to pay the additional cost for climbing, and you may play any number of wild movement symbols to contribute towards claiming a crystal shard. you may even claim shards with any character by playing 3 wild movement symbols. dr a w two cards immediately draw 2 action cards. if this would bring you above 7 cards, only draw 1 card. interr upt you may play this card out of turn immediately after another player takes an action, and declare an interrupt. the other player must finish their action (if they have not already done so), then you can play as many of your cards as you like, one at a time, as if it was your turn. you may choose to reveal characters at this point should you wish. the interrupting player can also be interrupted. once whichever player interrupted last is finished, play returns directly to the active player – any players who have previously interrupted do not get to play additional cards. you do not get to draw cards when you are finished with an interrupt. you cannot interrupt immediately after a character has been revealed or a different interrupt has been played. you must always let that player take at least 1 other action. however, if another player declares the end of their turn, you may interrupt immediately, before they pass the active player marker and draw 3 cards. once play returns, that player may choose to take further actions before once again declaring end of turn.to make sure other players have a clear opportunity to interrupt, mentally count to 3 between each action. never declare multiple actions at once. if multiple players wish to interrupt at the same time, the player closest in turn order to the active player interrupts first. other players must then let that player take at least 1 other action before deciding whether to interrupt them. line of sight to make a ranged attack, you must have line of sight (los): trace a line between the core numbers of the spaces the attacker and defender are in. if that line passes through a wall, or a space with cover that is not the attacker’s or defender’s space, you do not have los. you always have los to the space you are in. if you are on high ground, you may make a ranged attack on any other high ground you have los to, and to any lower ground you have los as long as that los is not traced through another space with high ground. if you are on low ground, you cannot trace los into or through any high ground. c ombat refe rence attack defendedby ending the g ame as soon as 1 player has 5 points in front of them, in the form of crystal shards, knocked out enemy characters or any combination of both, the game immediately ends and that player wins. if 1 player loses all of their characters, the game immediately ends and the surviving player with the most points wins. on a tie for most points, continue playing until any surviving player has 1 more point than the others. that player wins. the number of points you have should always be visible to the other players.

for dagon any 3 items. the banning player no longer takes a player action, and is not affected by creature activations or event cards; however they lose 1 sanity on their player turn. if reduced to 0 sanity they are out of the game and another player must travel to r’lyeh. until the goo is banned, the portal at miskatonic university cannot be closed, and therefore the game cannot be won. ending the game the game is lost if the necron marker reaches the demon space on the track before the goo in r’lyeh is revealed; necron reaches the dimension rift at the end of the track; or when all but one player has been eliminated by being reduced to 0 sanity. a player whose sanity drops to 0 is out of the game and their equipment is discarded. the game is won as soon as the goo in r’lyeh is banned and all portals (including the one at miskatonic university) are closed. verify that every portal has been closed with the correct artifact and no artifacts were placed where there was not a portal (ie a wall). you may score the game by counting the number of spaces remaining on the necron track and adding the total number of items (artifact and non-artifact) and the sanity each player possesses."

draw and reveal a number of cards equal to the weapon’s attack score. 4. total the hits and subtract the target’s handling to find the final number of hits. collisions end the vehicle’s move touching
